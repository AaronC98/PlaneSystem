--  This child package contains a procedure to load files

--  It is used by Sinput.P to load project files, by GPrep to load preprocessor
--  definition files and input files, and by ALI.Util to compute checksums for
--  source files.

package Sinput.C is

   function Load_File (Path : String) return Source_File_Index;
   --  Load a file into memory and Initialize the Scans state

end Sinput.C;
