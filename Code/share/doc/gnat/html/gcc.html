<h2 class="chapter">1 Programming Languages Supported by GCC</h2>

<p><a name="index-GCC-2"></a><a name="index-GNU-Compiler-Collection-3"></a><a name="index-GNU-C-Compiler-4"></a><a name="index-Ada-5"></a><a name="index-Fortran-6"></a><a name="index-Go-7"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC-8"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-9"></a>GCC stands for &ldquo;GNU Compiler Collection&rdquo;.  GCC is an integrated
distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.  These
languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++,
Fortran, Ada, Go, and BRIG (HSAIL).

 <p>The abbreviation <dfn>GCC</dfn> has multiple meanings in common use.  The
current official meaning is &ldquo;GNU Compiler Collection&rdquo;, which refers
generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood
for &ldquo;GNU C Compiler&rdquo;, and this usage is still common when the emphasis
is on compiling C programs.  Finally, the name is also used when speaking
of the <dfn>language-independent</dfn> component of GCC: code shared among the
compilers for all supported languages.

 <p>The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the
optimizers, as well as the &ldquo;back ends&rdquo; that generate machine code for
various processors.

 <p><a name="index-COBOL-10"></a><a name="index-Mercury-11"></a><a name="index-Pascal-12"></a>The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is
called the &ldquo;front end&rdquo;.  In addition to the front ends that are
integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that
are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,
Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with
GCC proper.

 <p><a name="index-C_002b_002b-13"></a><a name="index-G_002b_002b-14"></a><a name="index-Ada-15"></a><a name="index-GNAT-16"></a>Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names. 
The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we
talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that
compiler by its own name, or as GCC.  Either is correct.

 <p><a name="index-compiler-compared-to-C_002b_002b-preprocessor-17"></a><a name="index-intermediate-C-version_002c-nonexistent-18"></a><a name="index-C-intermediate-output_002c-nonexistent-19"></a>Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran,
have been implemented as &ldquo;preprocessors&rdquo; which emit another high
level language such as C.  None of the compilers included in GCC are
implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.  This
sort of preprocessor should not be confused with the <dfn>C
preprocessor</dfn>, which is an integral feature of the C, C++, Objective-C
and Objective-C++ languages.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Language Standards Supported by GCC</h2>

<p>For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly
with some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

<h3 class="section">2.1 C Language</h3>

<p><a name="index-C-standard-20"></a><a name="index-C-standards-21"></a><a name="index-ANSI-C-standard-22"></a><a name="index-ANSI-C-23"></a><a name="index-ANSI-C89-24"></a><a name="index-C89-25"></a><a name="index-ANSI-X3_002e159_002d1989-26"></a><a name="index-X3_002e159_002d1989-27"></a><a name="index-ISO-C-standard-28"></a><a name="index-ISO-C-29"></a><a name="index-ISO-C90-30"></a><a name="index-ISO_002fIEC-9899-31"></a><a name="index-ISO-9899-32"></a><a name="index-C90-33"></a><a name="index-ISO-C94-34"></a><a name="index-C94-35"></a><a name="index-ISO-C95-36"></a><a name="index-C95-37"></a><a name="index-ISO-C99-38"></a><a name="index-C99-39"></a><a name="index-ISO-C9X-40"></a><a name="index-C9X-41"></a><a name="index-ISO-C11-42"></a><a name="index-C11-43"></a><a name="index-ISO-C1X-44"></a><a name="index-C1X-45"></a><a name="index-ISO-C17-46"></a><a name="index-C17-47"></a><a name="index-Technical-Corrigenda-48"></a><a name="index-TC1-49"></a><a name="index-Technical-Corrigendum-1-50"></a><a name="index-TC2-51"></a><a name="index-Technical-Corrigendum-2-52"></a><a name="index-TC3-53"></a><a name="index-Technical-Corrigendum-3-54"></a><a name="index-AMD1-55"></a><a name="index-freestanding-implementation-56"></a><a name="index-freestanding-environment-57"></a><a name="index-hosted-implementation-58"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-59"></a><a name="index-g_t_005f_005fSTDC_005fHOSTED_005f_005f-60"></a>
<a name="index-std-61"></a><a name="index-ansi-62"></a><a name="index-pedantic-63"></a><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-64"></a>The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical
differences between these publications, although the sections of the
ANSI standard were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard. 
The ANSI
standard, but not the ISO standard, also came with a Rationale
document. 
This standard, in both its forms, is commonly known as <dfn>C89</dfn>, or
occasionally as <dfn>C90</dfn>, from the dates of ratification. 
To select this standard in GCC, use one of the options
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-std=c90</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:1990</span></samp>; to obtain
all the diagnostics required by the standard, you should also specify
<samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp> if you want them to be
errors rather than warnings).  See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

 <p>Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 <p>An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> to the language,
but otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known
as <dfn>AMD1</dfn>; the amended standard is sometimes known as <dfn>C94</dfn> or
<dfn>C95</dfn>.  To select this standard in GCC, use the option
<samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:199409</span></samp> (with, as for other standard versions,
<samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> to receive all required diagnostics).

 <p>A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as <dfn>C99</dfn>.  (While in
development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as
<dfn>C9X</dfn>.)  GCC has substantially
complete support for this standard version; see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html</a> for details.  To select this
standard, use <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:1999</span></samp>.

 <p>Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in three Technical
Corrigenda published in 2001, 2004 and 2007.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 <p>A fourth version of the C standard, known as <dfn>C11</dfn>, was published
in 2011 as ISO/IEC 9899:2011.  (While in development, drafts of this
standard version were referred to as <dfn>C1X</dfn>.) 
GCC has substantially complete support
for this standard, enabled with <samp><span class="option">-std=c11</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:2011</span></samp>.  A version with corrections integrated is
known as <dfn>C17</dfn> and is supported with <samp><span class="option">-std=c17</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:2017</span></samp>; the corrections are also applied with
<samp><span class="option">-std=c11</span></samp>, and the only difference between the options is the
value of <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code>.

 <p>By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that, on
rare occasions conflict with the C standard.  See <a href="#C-Extensions">Extensions to the C Language Family</a>. 
Some features that are part of the C99 standard
are accepted as extensions in C90 mode, and some features that are part
of the C11 standard are accepted as extensions in C90 and C99 modes. 
Use of the
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options listed above disables these extensions where
they conflict with the C standard version selected.  You may also
select an extended version of the C language explicitly with
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu90</span></samp> (for C90 with GNU extensions), <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp>
(for C99 with GNU extensions) or <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu11</span></samp> (for C11 with GNU
extensions).

 <p>The default, if no C language dialect options are given,
is <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu11</span></samp>.

 <p>The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A <dfn>conforming hosted implementation</dfn> supports the
whole standard including all the library facilities; a <dfn>conforming
freestanding implementation</dfn> is only required to provide certain
library facilities: those in <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>; since AMD1, also those in
<code>&lt;iso646.h&gt;</code>; since C99, also those in <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>; and since C11, also those in <code>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;stdnoreturn.h&gt;</code>.  In addition, complex types, added in C99, are not
required for freestanding implementations.

 <p>The standard also defines two environments for programs, a
<dfn>freestanding environment</dfn>, required of all implementations and
which may not have library facilities beyond those required of
freestanding implementations, where the handling of program startup
and termination are implementation-defined; and a <dfn>hosted
environment</dfn>, which is not required, in which all the library
facilities are provided and startup is through a function <code>int
main (void)</code> or <code>int main (int, char *[])</code>.  An OS kernel is an example
of a program running in a freestanding environment;
a program using the facilities of an
operating system is an example of a program running in a hosted environment.

 <p><a name="index-ffreestanding-65"></a>GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it acts as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining <code>__STDC_HOSTED__</code> as <code>1</code> and
presuming that when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have
the semantics defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming
freestanding implementation for a freestanding environment, use the
option <samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp>; it then defines
<code>__STDC_HOSTED__</code> to <code>0</code> and does not make assumptions about the
meanings of function names from the standard library, with exceptions
noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may well still need to make
your own arrangements for linking and startup. 
See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

 <p>GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations on all platforms. 
To use the facilities of a hosted
environment, you need to find them elsewhere (for example, in the
GNU C library).  See <a href="#Standard-Libraries">Standard Libraries</a>.

 <p>Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
<samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp>, but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the
freestanding environment provide <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memmove</code>,
<code>memset</code> and <code>memcmp</code>. 
Finally, if <code>__builtin_trap</code> is used, and the target does
not implement the <code>trap</code> pattern, then GCC emits a call
to <code>abort</code>.

<h3 class="section">2.2 C++ Language</h3>

<p>GCC supports the original ISO C++ standard published in 1998,
and the 2011 and 2014 revisions.

 <p>The original ISO C++ standard was published as the ISO standard (ISO/IEC
14882:1998) and amended by a Technical Corrigenda published in 2003
(ISO/IEC 14882:2003). These standards are referred to as C++98 and
C++03, respectively. GCC implements the majority of C++98 (<code>export</code>
is a notable exception) and most of the changes in C++03.  To select
this standard in GCC, use one of the options <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-std=c++03</span></samp>; to obtain all the diagnostics
required by the standard, you should also specify <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> (or
<samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp> if you want them to be errors rather than
warnings).

 <p>A revised ISO C++ standard was published in 2011 as ISO/IEC
14882:2011, and is referred to as C++11; before its publication it was
commonly referred to as C++0x.  C++11 contains several changes to the
C++ language, all of which have been implemented in GCC. For details
see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx11">https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx11</a>. 
To select this standard in GCC, use the option <samp><span class="option">-std=c++11</span></samp>.

 <p>Another revised ISO C++ standard was published in 2014 as ISO/IEC
14882:2014, and is referred to as C++14; before its publication it was
sometimes referred to as C++1y.  C++14 contains several further
changes to the C++ language, all of which have been implemented in GCC. 
For details see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx14">https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx14</a>. 
To select this standard in GCC, use the option <samp><span class="option">-std=c++14</span></samp>.

 <p>The C++ language was further revised in 2017 and ISO/IEC 14882:2017 was
published.  This is referred to as C++17, and before publication was
often referred to as C++1z.  GCC supports all the changes in the new
specification.  For further details see
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx1z">https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx1z</a>.  Use the option
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp> to select this variant of C++.

 <p>More information about the C++ standards is available on the ISO C++
committee's web site at <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/</a>.

 <p>To obtain all the diagnostics required by any of the standard versions
described above you should specify <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp>, otherwise GCC will allow some non-ISO C++
features as extensions. See <a href="#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.

 <p>By default, GCC also provides some additional extensions to the C++ language
that on rare occasions conflict with the C++ standard.  See <a href="#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>.  Use of the
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options listed above disables these extensions where they
they conflict with the C++ standard version selected.  You may also
select an extended version of the C++ language explicitly with
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++98</span></samp> (for C++98 with GNU extensions), or
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++11</span></samp> (for C++11 with GNU extensions), or
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++14</span></samp> (for C++14 with GNU extensions), or
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++17</span></samp> (for C++17 with GNU extensions).

 <p>The default, if
no C++ language dialect options are given, is <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++14</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Objective-C and Objective-C++ Languages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Objective_002dC-66"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-67"></a>
GCC supports &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Objective-C (also known as &ldquo;Objective-C
1.0&rdquo;) and contains support for the Objective-C exception and
synchronization syntax.  It has also support for a number of
&ldquo;Objective-C 2.0&rdquo; language extensions, including properties, fast
enumeration (only for Objective-C), method attributes and the
@optional and @required keywords in protocols.  GCC supports
Objective-C++ and features available in Objective-C are also available
in Objective-C++.

 <p>GCC by default uses the GNU Objective-C runtime library, which is part
of GCC and is not the same as the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime
library used on Apple systems.  There are a number of differences
documented in this manual.  The options <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-runtime</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fnext-runtime</span></samp> allow you to switch between producing output
that works with the GNU Objective-C runtime library and output that
works with the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime library.

 <p>There is no formal written standard for Objective-C or Objective-C++. 
The authoritative manual on traditional Objective-C (1.0) is
&ldquo;Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective-C Language&rdquo;:
<a href="http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/ObjectivCBook.pdf">http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/ObjectivCBook.pdf</a>
is the original NeXTstep document.

 <p>The Objective-C exception and synchronization syntax (that is, the
keywords <code>@try</code>, <code>@throw</code>, <code>@catch</code>,
<code>@finally</code> and <code>@synchronized</code>) is
supported by GCC and is enabled with the option
<samp><span class="option">-fobjc-exceptions</span></samp>.  The syntax is briefly documented in this
manual and in the Objective-C 2.0 manuals from Apple.

 <p>The Objective-C 2.0 language extensions and features are automatically
enabled; they include properties (via the <code>@property</code>,
<code>@synthesize</code> and
<code>@dynamic keywords</code>), fast enumeration (not available in
Objective-C++), attributes for methods (such as <code>deprecated</code>,
<code>noreturn</code>, <code>sentinel</code>, <code>format</code>),
the <code>unused</code> attribute for method arguments, the
<code>@package</code> keyword for instance variables and the <code>@optional</code> and
<code>@required</code> keywords in protocols.  You can disable all these
Objective-C 2.0 language extensions with the option
<samp><span class="option">-fobjc-std=objc1</span></samp>, which causes the compiler to recognize the
same Objective-C language syntax recognized by GCC 4.0, and to produce
an error if one of the new features is used.

 <p>GCC has currently no support for non-fragile instance variables.

 <p>The authoritative manual on Objective-C 2.0 is available from Apple:
     <ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html</a>
</ul>

 <p>For more information concerning the history of Objective-C that is
available online, see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Go Language</h3>

<p>As of the GCC 4.7.1 release, GCC supports the Go 1 language standard,
described at <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1">https://golang.org/doc/go1</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.5 HSA Intermediate Language (HSAIL)</h3>

<p>GCC can compile the binary representation (BRIG) of the HSAIL text format as
described in HSA Programmer's Reference Manual version 1.0.1. This
capability is typically utilized to implement the HSA runtime API's HSAIL
finalization extension for a gcc supported processor. HSA standards are
freely available at <a href="http://www.hsafoundation.com/standards/">http://www.hsafoundation.com/standards/</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.6 References for Other Languages</h3>

<h2 class="chapter">3 GCC Command Options</h2>

<p><a name="index-GCC-command-options-68"></a><a name="index-command-options-69"></a><a name="index-options_002c-GCC-command-70"></a>
<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The &ldquo;overall options&rdquo; allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler. 
See <a href="#Overall-Options">Options Controlling the Kind of Output</a>.

 <p>Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

 <p><a name="index-C-compilation-options-71"></a>Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

 <p><a name="index-cross-compiling-72"></a><a name="index-specifying-machine-version-73"></a><a name="index-specifying-compiler-version-and-target-machine-74"></a><a name="index-compiler-version_002c-specifying-75"></a><a name="index-target-machine_002c-specifying-76"></a>The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, or
<samp><var>machine</var><span class="command">-gcc</span></samp> when cross-compiling, or
<samp><var>machine</var><span class="command">-gcc-</span><var>version</var></samp> to run a specific version of GCC. 
When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp>
instead.  See <a href="#Invoking-G_002b_002b">Compiling C++ Programs</a>,
for information about the differences in behavior between <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>
and <code>g++</code> when compiling C++ programs.

 <p><a name="index-grouping-options-77"></a><a name="index-options_002c-grouping-78"></a>The <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <em>not</em> be grouped: <samp><span class="option">-dv</span></samp> is very different from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-d&nbsp;-v</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.

 <p><a name="index-order-of-options-79"></a><a name="index-options_002c-order-80"></a>You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option is significant.

 <p>Many options have long names starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; or with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;for example,
<samp><span class="option">-fmove-loop-invariants</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<samp><span class="option">-ffoo</span></samp> is <samp><span class="option">-fno-foo</span></samp>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h3>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

 <p><a name="index-file-name-suffix-81"></a>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

     <dl>

 <p><a name="index-x-82"></a>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x </code><var>language</var><dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
     <pre class="smallexample">          c  c-header  cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output

          go
          brig
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-x none</code><dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>
has not been used at all). 
</dl>

 <p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> (or filename suffixes) to tell <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> where to start, and
one of the options <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> to say where
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x cpp-output -E</span></samp>&rsquo;) instruct <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> to do nothing at all.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd><a name="index-c-83"></a>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

     <p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd><a name="index-S-84"></a>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

     <p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.s</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-E-85"></a>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

     <p>Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

     <p><a name="index-output-file-option-86"></a><br><dt><code>-o </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-o-87"></a>Place output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <samp><span class="file">a.out</span></samp>, the object file for
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var></samp> in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.o</span></samp>, its
assembler file in <samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.s</span></samp>, a precompiled header file in
<samp><var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var><span class="file">.gch</span></samp>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd><a name="index-v-88"></a>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

     <br><dt><code>-###</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023_0023_0023-89"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or <code>./-_</code>. 
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.

     <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd><a name="index-help-90"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>.  If the <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> option is also specified
then <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> option has also been specified
(prior to the <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.

     <br><dt><code>--target-help</code><dd><a name="index-target_002dhelp-91"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.

     <br><dt><code>--help={</code><var>class</var><span class="roman">|[</span><code>^</code><span class="roman">]</span><var>qualifier</var><code>}</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>,...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">optimizers</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warnings</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<samp><span class="option">--target-help</span></samp> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> syntax.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">params</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display the values recognized by the <samp><span class="option">--param</span></samp>
option.

          <br><dt><var>language</var><dd>Display the options supported for <var>language</var>, where
<var>language</var> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">common</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display the options that are common to all languages. 
</dl>

     <p>These are the supported qualifiers:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">undocumented</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display only those options that are undocumented.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">joined</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--help=target</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">separate</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o output-file</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

     <p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,undocumented
</pre>
     <p>The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
</pre>
     <p>The argument to <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.

     <p>Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
<var>target</var>.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,optimizers
</pre>
     <p>The <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.

     <p>If the <samp><span class="option">-Q</span></samp> option appears on the command line before the
<samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <samp><span class="option">--help=</span></samp> option is used).

     <p>Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">            % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
            The following options are target specific:
            -mabi=                                2
            -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
            -mapcs                                [disabled]
</pre>
     <p>The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -Q -O2 --help=optimizers
</pre>
     <p>Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
          gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
          diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>--version</code><dd><a name="index-version-92"></a>Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

     <br><dt><code>-pass-exit-codes</code><dd><a name="index-pass_002dexit_002dcodes-93"></a>Normally the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<samp><span class="option">-pass-exit-codes</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.

     <br><dt><code>-pipe</code><dd><a name="index-pipe-94"></a>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has

<samp><span class="command">cc1plus</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>, etc.  More than one
<samp><span class="option">-specs=</span><var>file</var></samp> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.  See <a href="#Spec-Files">Spec Files</a>, for
information about the format of the <var>file</var>.

     <br><dt><code>-wrapper</code><dd><a name="index-wrapper-96"></a>Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

<h3 class="section">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-dialect-options-109"></a><a name="index-language-dialect-options-110"></a><a name="index-options_002c-dialect-111"></a>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:

     
<a name="index-ANSI-support-112"></a>
<a name="index-ISO-support-113"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-ansi</code><dd><a name="index-ansi-114"></a>In C mode, this is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-std=c90</span></samp>. In C++ mode, it is
equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp>.

     <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo; comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.

     <p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> is required in
addition to <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>.  See <a href="#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.

     <p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

     <p>Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in
functions when <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> is used.  See <a href="#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions
affected.

     <br><dt><code>-std=</code><dd><a name="index-std-115"></a>Determine the language standard. See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of these standard versions.  This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.

     <p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c90</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c++98</span></samp>&rsquo;, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu90</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu++98</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
<samp><span class="option">-std=c90</span></samp> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code>
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <code>?:</code>
expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</span></samp> warns about C++ style &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo;
comments, while <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</span></samp> does not.

GNU semantics for <code>inline</code> functions when in C99 mode. 
See <a href="#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>. 
Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
<code>gnu_inline</code> function attribute to all inline functions
(see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu89-inline</span></samp> explicitly tells GCC to use the
C99 semantics for <code>inline</code> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior). 
This option is not supported in <samp><span class="option">-std=c90</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu90</span></samp> mode.

     <p>The preprocessor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> and

<code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> that indicate that operations and constants with
a semantic type that is an interchange or extended format should be
evaluated to the precision and range of that type.  These new values are
a superset of those permitted under C99/C11, which does not specify the
meaning of other positive values of <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code>.  As such, code
conforming to C11 may not have been written expecting the possibility of
the new values.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods</span></samp> specifies whether the compiler

     <p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span></samp> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp>), this
switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since
<code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

including those which are not built-in functions when <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     <p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> for bad calls to
<code>printf</code> when <code>printf</code> is built in and <code>strlen</code> is
known not to modify global memory.

     <p>With the <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option
only the built-in function <var>function</var> is
disabled.  <var>function</var> must not begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__builtin_</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<samp><span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><var>function</var></samp> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp>, you may define macros such as:

not explicitly specify.  The <var>geom</var> value is a triple of
':'-separated sizes, in order 'gang', 'worker' and, 'vector'.  A size
can be omitted, to use a target-specific default value.

     <br><dt><code>-fopenmp</code><dd><a name="index-fopenmp-134"></a><a name="index-OpenMP-parallel-135"></a>Enable handling of OpenMP directives <code>#pragma omp</code> in C/C++ and

compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v4.5 <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</a><!-- /@w -->.  This option

in C/C++ and <code>!$omp</code> in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives
are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu-tm</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu_002dtm-139"></a>When the option <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span></samp> is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
Memory ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions
of GCC, as the official specification changes.  Please note that not
all architectures are supported for this feature.

     <p>For more information on GCC's support for transactional memory,
See <a href="libitm.html#Enabling-libitm">The GNU Transactional Memory Library</a>.

     <p>Note that the transactional memory feature is not supported with
non-call exceptions (<samp><span class="option">-fnon-call-exceptions</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-140"></a>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     <p>In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
to previous types declarations.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int UOW;
          struct ABC {
            UOW UOW;
          };
</pre>
     <p>Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  See <a href="#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details.

     <p>Note that this option is off for all targets but x86
targets using ms-abi.

     <br><dt><code>-fplan9-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fplan9_002dextensions-141"></a>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.

     <p>This enables <samp><span class="option">-fms-extensions</span></samp>, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.  See <a href="#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details.  This is only
supported for C, not C++.

     <br><dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code><dd><a name="index-fcond_002dmismatch-142"></a>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.

     <br><dt><code>-flax-vector-conversions</code><dd><a name="index-flax_002dvector_002dconversions-143"></a>Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.

     <br><dt><code>-funsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-funsigned_002dchar-144"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.

     <p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.

     <p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. 
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

     <p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dchar-145"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.

     <p>Note that this is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fno-unsigned-char</span></samp>, which is
the negative form of <samp><span class="option">-funsigned-char</span></samp>.  Likewise, the option
<samp><span class="option">-fno-signed-char</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-funsigned-char</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-146"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-147"></a><a name="index-fno_002dsigned_002dbitfields-148"></a><a name="index-fno_002dunsigned_002dbitfields-149"></a>These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.

     <br><dt><code>-fsso-struct=</code><var>endianness</var><dd><a name="index-fsso_002dstruct-150"></a>Set the default scalar storage order of structures and unions to the
specified endianness.  The accepted values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">big-endian</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">little-endian</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; for the native endianness of
the target (the default).  This option is not supported for C++.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp><span class="option">-fsso-struct</span></samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without it if the
specified endianness is not the native endianness of the target.

<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b-151"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command_002dline-152"></a><a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b-153"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <samp><span class="file">firstClass.C</span></samp> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, only <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-enums</span></samp> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

 <p>Some options for compiling C programs, such as <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp>, are also
relevant for C++ programs. 
See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

 <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fabi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dversion-154"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.

     <p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.

     <p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.

     <p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.

     <p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.

     <p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.

     <p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.

     <p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and &ndash;, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.

     <p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.

     <p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.

     <p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code>nullptr_t</code>.

     <p>Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stdcall</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <p>Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies <samp><span class="option">-fnew-inheriting-ctors</span></samp>.

     <p>Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling
conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes
with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a
trivial move constructor.

     <p>Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental
change in version 12.

     <p>See also <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dcompat_002dversion-155"></a>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name. 
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=0</span></samp> (the default), this defaults to 11 (GCC 7
compatibility).  If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version=2</span></samp>.

     <p>If this option is not provided but <samp><span class="option">-Wabi=</span><var>n</var></samp> is, that
version is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is provided
along with <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> (without the version), the version from this
option is used for the warning.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-access-control</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol-156"></a>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

     <br><dt><code>-faligned-new</code><dd><a name="index-faligned_002dnew-157"></a>Enable support for C++17 <code>new</code> of types that require more
alignment than <code>void* ::operator new(std::size_t)</code> provides.  A
numeric argument such as <code>-faligned-new=32</code> can be used to
specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function,
but few users will need to override the default of
<code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code>.

     <p>This flag is enabled by default for <samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code><dd><a name="index-fcheck_002dnew-158"></a>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared
<code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new (nothrow)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-fconcepts</code><dd><a name="index-fconcepts-159"></a>Enable support for the C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical
Specification, ISO 19217 (2015), which allows code like

     <pre class="smallexample">          template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool Addable = requires (T t) { t + t; };
          template &lt;Addable T&gt; T add (T a, T b) { return a + b; }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002ddepth-160"></a>Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.

     <br><dt><code>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fconstexpr_002dloop_002dlimit-161"></a>Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect infinite loops during
constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).

     <br><dt><code>-fdeduce-init-list</code><dd><a name="index-fdeduce_002dinit_002dlist-162"></a>Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
<code>std::initializer_list</code> from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.

     <pre class="smallexample">          template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
          {
            return realfn (t);
          }
          
          void f()
          {
            forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
          }
</pre>
     <p>This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-ffriend-injection</code><dd><a name="index-ffriend_002dinjection-163"></a>Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared. 
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual. 
However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  GCC defaults to the standard behavior.

     <p>This option is deprecated and will be removed.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors-164"></a>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.

     <p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs-165"></a>Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

     <br><dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code><dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code><dd><a name="index-fextern_002dtls_002dinit-166"></a><a name="index-fno_002dextern_002dtls_002dinit-167"></a>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and
<code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization. 
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp> option.

     <p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<samp><span class="option">-fextern-tls-init</span></samp>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffor-scope</code><dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code><dd><a name="index-ffor_002dscope-168"></a><a name="index-fno_002dfor_002dscope-169"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-ffor-scope</span></samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <code>for</code> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard. 
If <samp><span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span></samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

     <p>This option is deprecated and the associated non-standard
functionality will be removed.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords-170"></a>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead. 
This option is implied by the strict ISO C++ dialects: <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-std=c++11</span></samp>, etc.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-171"></a>Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-172"></a>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-173"></a>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-174"></a>Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.

     <br><dt><code>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</code><dd><a name="index-fnew_002dinheriting_002dctors-175"></a>Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11 constructor
inheritance.  This is part of C++17 but also considered to be a Defect
Report against C++11 and C++14.  This flag is enabled by default
unless <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=10</span></samp> or lower is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-fnew-ttp-matching</code><dd><a name="index-fnew_002dttp_002dmatching-176"></a>Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template
parameters and default arguments: this allows a template with default
template arguments as an argument for a template template parameter
with fewer template parameters.  This flag is enabled by default for
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnonansi_002dbuiltins-177"></a>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fnothrow-opt</code><dd><a name="index-fnothrow_002dopt-178"></a>Treat a <code>throw()</code> exception specification as if it were a
<code>noexcept</code> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to <code>terminate</code> rather than <code>unexpected</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doperator_002dnames-179"></a>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doptional_002ddiags-180"></a>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.

     <br><dt><code>-fpermissive</code><dd><a name="index-fpermissive-181"></a>Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <samp><span class="option">-fpermissive</span></samp> allows some
nonconforming code to compile.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-pretty-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dpretty_002dtemplates-182"></a>When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <code>void f(T) [with T = int]</code>
rather than <code>void f(int)</code>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <samp><span class="option">-fno-pretty-templates</span></samp> to disable them.

     <br><dt><code>-frepo</code><dd><a name="index-frepo-183"></a>Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span></samp>.  See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-rtti</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002drtti-184"></a>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <code>void *</code> or to
unambiguous base classes.

     <br><dt><code>-fsized-deallocation</code><dd><a name="index-fsized_002ddeallocation-185"></a>Enable the built-in global declarations
     <pre class="smallexample">          void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
          void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
</pre>
     <p>as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object

warns about places that might want to add a definition.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-enums</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002denums-186"></a>Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrong-eval-order</code><dd><a name="index-fstrong_002deval_002dorder-187"></a>Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift expressions in

as adopted for C++17.  Enabled by default with <samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="option">-fstrong-eval-order=some</span></samp> enables just the ordering of member
access and shift expressions, and is the default without
<samp><span class="option">-std=c++17</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002dbacktrace_002dlimit-188"></a>Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-depth=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002ddepth-189"></a>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>. 
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-threadsafe-statics</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dthreadsafe_002dstatics-190"></a>Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-cxa-atexit</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dcxa_002datexit-191"></a>Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<code>__cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the <code>atexit</code> function. 
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
<code>__cxa_atexit</code>.

if the runtime routine is not available.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code><dd><a name="index-fvisibility_002dinlines_002dhidden-193"></a>This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.

     <p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<code>__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))</code> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

     <p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

     <p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.

     <p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility-ms-compat</code><dd><a name="index-fvisibility_002dms_002dcompat-194"></a>This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

     <p>The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It sets the default visibility to <code>hidden</code>, like
<samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp>.

          <li>Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

          <li>The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
          </ol>

     <p>In new code it is better to use <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible. 
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.

     <p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-weak</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dweak-195"></a>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker. 
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-196"></a>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.) 
</dl>

 <p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wabi </code><span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wabi-197"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dabi-198"></a>Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not compatible with
the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Since G++ now defaults to updating the
ABI with each major release, normally <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> will warn only if
there is a check added later in a release series for an ABI issue
discovered since the initial release.  <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> will warn about
more things if an older ABI version is selected (with
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=</span><var>n</var></samp>).

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about compatibility with a particular <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version</span></samp>
level, e.g. <samp><span class="option">-Wabi=2</span></samp> to warn about changes relative to
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=2</span></samp>.

     <p>If an explicit version number is provided and
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version</span></samp> is not specified, the version number
from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit
version number is provided with this option, but
<samp><span class="option">-fabi-compat-version</span></samp> is specified, that version number is
used for ABI warnings.

     <p>Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.

     <p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     <p>Known incompatibilities in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=2</span></samp> (which was the
default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:

          <ul>
<li>A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly:
          <pre class="smallexample">               extern int N;
               template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
               void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}
</pre>
          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=3</span></samp>.

          <li>SIMD vector types declared using <code>__attribute ((vector_size))</code> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.

          <p>The mangling was changed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=4</span></samp>.

          <li><code>__attribute ((const))</code> and <code>noreturn</code> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <code>decltype</code> of a plain declaration was folded away.

          <p>These mangling issues were fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=5</span></samp>.

          <li>Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <code>va_arg</code> to complain. 
On most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <code>int</code>.

          <p>Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code>, prefix increment/decrement, and
a class scope function used as a template argument.

          <p>These issues were corrected in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=6</span></samp>.

          <li>Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
ABI changed the mangling of <code>nullptr_t</code>.

          <p>These issues were corrected in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=7</span></samp>.

          <li>When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate.

          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=8</span></samp>, the default for GCC 5.1.

          <li><code>decltype(nullptr)</code> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a <code>nullptr_t</code> parameter, as parameters have a
minimum alignment.

          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=9</span></samp>, the default for GCC 5.2.

          <li>Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a type, such as
ia32 calling conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.),
did not affect the mangled name, leading to name collisions when
function pointers were used as template arguments.

          <p>This was fixed in <samp><span class="option">-fabi-version=10</span></samp>, the default for GCC 6.1.

     </ul>

     <p>It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:

          <ul>
<li>For SysV/x86-64, unions with <code>long double</code> members are
passed in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               union U {
                 long double ld;
                 int i;
               };

suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>. 
For example:

<h3 class="section">3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-248"></a><a name="index-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-options_002c-command_002dline-249"></a><a name="index-options_002c-Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-250"></a>(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for references.)

 <p>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent GNU compiler options. 
For example, you might compile a file <samp><span class="file">some_class.m</span></samp> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-runtime</span></samp> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by GCC.

 <p>Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
C++-specific options (e.g., <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp>).

 <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fconstant-string-class=</code><var>class-name</var><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dstring_002dclass-251"></a>Use <var>class-name</var> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <code>@"..."</code>.  The default
class name is <code>NXConstantString</code> if the GNU runtime is being used, and
<code>NSConstantString</code> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<samp><span class="option">-fconstant-cfstrings</span></samp> option, if also present, overrides the
<samp><span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span></samp> setting and cause <code>@"..."</code> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu_002druntime-252"></a>Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

     <br><dt><code>-fnext-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fnext_002druntime-253"></a>Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
<code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nil-receivers</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnil_002dreceivers-254"></a>Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (<code>[receiver
message:arg]</code>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not <code>nil</code>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-abi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dabi_002dversion-255"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime. 
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dcall_002dcxx_002dcdtors-256"></a>For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <code>self</code>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.

     <p>The <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> and <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code>
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the <code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.

     <p>As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the <code>- (id) .cxx_construct</code> and
<code>- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002ddirect_002ddispatch-257"></a>Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dexceptions-258"></a>Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords <code>@try</code>,
<code>@throw</code>, <code>@catch</code>, <code>@finally</code> and
<code>@synchronized</code>.  This option is available with both the GNU
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-gc</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dgc-259"></a>Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-nilcheck</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dnilcheck-260"></a>For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call. 
This is the default and can be disabled using
<samp><span class="option">-fno-objc-nilcheck</span></samp>.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to. 
Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is used.

     <br><dt><code>-fobjc-std=objc1</code><dd><a name="index-fobjc_002dstd-261"></a>Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to C/C++ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected. 
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of GCC.

     <br><dt><code>-freplace-objc-classes</code><dd><a name="index-freplace_002dobjc_002dclasses-262"></a>Emit a special marker instructing <samp><span class="command">ld(1)</span></samp> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <samp><span class="command">dyld(1)</span></samp> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3
and later.

     <br><dt><code>-fzero-link</code><dd><a name="index-fzero_002dlink-263"></a>When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <samp><span class="option">-fzero-link</span></samp> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <code>objc_getClass("...")</code>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution. 
The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to <code>objc_get_class("...")</code>
regardless of command-line options.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-local-ivars</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dlocal_002divars-264"></a><a name="index-flocal_002divars-265"></a>By default instance variables in Objective-C can be accessed as if
they were local variables from within the methods of the class they're
declared in.  This can lead to shadowing between instance variables
and other variables declared either locally inside a class method or
globally with the same name.  Specifying the <samp><span class="option">-fno-local-ivars</span></samp>
flag disables this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing issues.

     <br><dt><code>-fivar-visibility=</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>public</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>protected</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>private</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>package</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-fivar_002dvisibility-266"></a>Set the default instance variable visibility to the specified option
so that instance variables declared outside the scope of any access
modifier directives default to the specified visibility.

     <br><dt><code>-gen-decls</code><dd><a name="index-gen_002ddecls-267"></a>Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <samp><var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.decl</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wassign-intercept </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wassign_002dintercept-268"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dassign_002dintercept-269"></a>Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-protocol </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dprotocol-270"></a><a name="index-Wprotocol-271"></a>If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-protocol</span></samp> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

     <br><dt><code>-Wselector </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wselector-272"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dselector-273"></a>Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <code>@selector(...)</code>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <samp><span class="option">-fsyntax-only</span></samp> option is
being used.

     <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-selector-match </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wstrict_002dselector_002dmatch-274"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dstrict_002dselector_002dmatch-275"></a>Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type <code>id</code> or <code>Class</code>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.

     <br><dt><code>-Wundeclared-selector </code><span class="roman">(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wundeclared_002dselector-276"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dundeclared_002dselector-277"></a>Warn if a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<code>@selector(...)</code> expression, either explicitly in an
<code>@interface</code> or <code>@protocol</code> declaration, or implicitly in
an <code>@implementation</code> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression is found,
while <samp><span class="option">-Wselector</span></samp> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

     <br><dt><code>-print-objc-runtime-info</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dobjc_002druntime_002dinfo-278"></a>Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
value, if any.

<h3 class="section">3.7 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-diagnostics-formatting-279"></a><a name="index-diagnostic-messages-280"></a><a name="index-message-formatting-281"></a>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, <small class="dots">...</small>).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages,
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fmessage-length=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fmessage_002dlength-282"></a>Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about
<var>n</var> characters.  If <var>n</var> is zero, then no line-wrapping is
done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the
default for all front ends.

     <br><dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</code><dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics_002dshow_002dlocation-283"></a>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information <em>once</em>; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</code><dd>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

     <br><dt><code>-fdiagnostics-color[=</code><var>WHEN</var><code>]</code><dt><code>-fno-diagnostics-color</code><dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics_002dcolor-284"></a><a name="index-highlight_002c-color-285"></a><a name="index-GCC_005fCOLORS-_0040r_007benvironment-variable_007d-286"></a>Use color in diagnostics.  <var>WHEN</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">never</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">always</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above <var>WHEN</var> options or also &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">never</span></samp>&rsquo;
if <samp><span class="env">GCC_COLORS</span></samp> environment variable isn't present in the environment,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; otherwise. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal. 
The forms <samp><span class="option">-fdiagnostics-color</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-color</span></samp> are
aliases for <samp><span class="option">-fdiagnostics-color=always</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fdiagnostics-color=never</span></samp>, respectively.

     <p>The colors are defined by the environment variable <samp><span class="env">GCC_COLORS</span></samp>. 
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons. 
Common values to concatenate include
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; for bold,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo; for underline,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5</span></samp>&rsquo; for blink,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7</span></samp>&rsquo; for inverse,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">39</span></samp>&rsquo; for default foreground color,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">30</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">37</span></samp>&rsquo; for foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">90</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">97</span></samp>&rsquo; for 16-color mode foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">38;5;0</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">38;5;255</span></samp>&rsquo;
for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">49</span></samp>&rsquo; for default background color,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">40</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">47</span></samp>&rsquo; for background colors,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">100</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">107</span></samp>&rsquo; for 16-color mode background colors,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">48;5;0</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">48;5;255</span></samp>&rsquo;
for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

     <p>The default <samp><span class="env">GCC_COLORS</span></samp> is

<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-warnings-311"></a><a name="index-warning-messages-312"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-313"></a><a name="index-suppressing-warnings-314"></a>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

 <p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

     
<a name="index-syntax-checking-315"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code><dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly-316"></a>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

     <br><dt><code>-fmax-errors=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fmax_002derrors-317"></a>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> is also
specified, then <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> takes precedence over this
option.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dd><a name="index-w-318"></a>Inhibit all warning messages.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror</code><dd><a name="index-Werror-319"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror-320"></a>Make all warnings into errors.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror=</code><dd><a name="index-Werror_003d-321"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d-322"></a>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp><span class="option">-Werror=switch</span></samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=switch</span></samp> makes
<samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp>
is in effect.

     <p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp> as described above. 
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</span></samp> flag.)

     <p>Note that specifying <samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.

     <br><dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code><dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors-323"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors-324"></a>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

 </dl>

 <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit</span></samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wno-</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span></samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

 <p>Some options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused</span></samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused-value</span></samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.

 <p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp><span class="option">-Wunknown-warning</span></samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp><span class="option">-Wno-unknown-warning</span></samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code><dt><code>-pedantic</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic-325"></a><a name="index-Wpedantic-326"></a>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option used.

     <p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or a
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

     <p>Some users try to use <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     <p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     <p>Where the standard specified with <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu90</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-327"></a>Give an error whenever the <dfn>base standard</dfn> (see <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Werror=pedantic</span></samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.

     <br><dt><code>-Wall</code><dd><a name="index-Wall-328"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dall-329"></a>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to

poorly optimized code and is useful only in the

Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <code>sprintf</code>
below is diagnosed because even with both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> equal to zero,
the terminating NUL character (<code>'\0'</code>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.

               <pre class="smallexample">                    void f (int a, int b)
                    {
                      char buf [13];
                      sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
                    }
</pre>
               <br><dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=2</code><dd>Level <var>2</var> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<var>2</var>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive's precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.

               <p>At level <var>2</var>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <var>a</var> equal to a 32-bit <code>INT_MIN</code> the first
<code>%i</code> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.

               <p>An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <code>short int</code> type then using either the <code>%hi</code> format
directive or casting the argument to <code>short</code> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.

of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     <p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     <p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. 
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     <p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     <p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C++.

     <p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

or if a variable may be clobbered by a <code>setjmp</code> call. In C++,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static <code>const</code> member
appears in a class without constructors.

     <p>If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the

     <p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <code>volatile</code>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.

     <p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

     <p>These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
GCC does not keep track of the state of variables.

     <p>These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:

     <p class="noindent">If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this. To suppress the

call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning

in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.

It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

     <p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

          <dl>
<dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=1</code><dd>Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For

<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=2</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <code>abs (x) &gt;= 0</code>.  This can only be
simplified when signed integer overflow is undefined, because
<code>abs (INT_MIN)</code> overflows to <code>INT_MIN</code>, which is less than
zero.  <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> (with no level) is the same as
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow=2</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=3</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=5</code><dd>Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <code>x + 2 &gt; y</code> is
simplified to <code>x + 1 &gt;= y</code>.  This is reported only at the

The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays

The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the GCC built-in functions like <code>__builtin_memcpy</code> that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow

<code>strncpy</code>, and <code>stpncpy</code> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.

     <p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncat</code> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <code>bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)</code> as the bound.

     <p>As another example, the following call to <code>strncpy</code> results in copying
to <code>d</code> just the characters preceding the terminating NUL, without
appending the NUL to the end.  Assuming the result of <code>strncpy</code> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <code>memcpy</code> instead.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void copy (char *d, const char *s)

</pre>
     <p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncpy</code> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <code>sizeof buf - 1</code> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <code>NUL</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void copy (const char *s)

     <p>In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence
of bytes with no terminating <code>NUL</code> such an array may be annotated
with attribute <code>nonstring</code> to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
however, are not suitable arguments to functions that expect

issue a warning because the call to <code>alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.

     <p>Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <code>alloca</code> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func ()
          {
            void *p = alloca (n);
            f (p);
          }
</pre>
     <p>If <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.

     <p>Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func (signed int n)
          {
            if (n &lt; 500)
              {
                p = alloca (n);
                f (p);
              }
          }
</pre>
     <p>In the above example, <var>n</var> could be negative, causing a larger than
expected argument to be implicitly cast into the <code>alloca</code> call.

     <p>This option also warns when <code>alloca</code> is used in a loop.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.

          <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

          <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

          <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

          <li>The unary plus operator.

          <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MIN</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MAX</span></samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          <li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          <li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional-conversion</span></samp>.

          <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=local</span></samp>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
          {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)

              ...
            }
            ...
          }
</pre>
     <p>Since the two variable <code>i</code> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=compatible-local</span></samp> will not emit a warning. 
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=local</span></samp> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.

different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <dfn>normalization rules</dfn> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

     <p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfc</span></samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <dfn>NFC</dfn>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized</span></samp>.

     <p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=id</span></samp> suppresses the warning for these characters. 
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.

     <p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=none</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-normalized</span></samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
&ldquo;D&rdquo;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.

     <p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <dfn>NFKC</dfn>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfkc</span></samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

<h3 class="section">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-options_002c-debugging-758"></a><a name="index-debugging-information-options-759"></a>
To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost
all cases you need only to add <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> to your other options.

 <p>GCC allows you to use <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> with
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops. 
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

 <p>If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
using <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>) with <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>. 
With no <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option at all, some compiler passes that collect
information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that
<samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> may result in a better debugging experience.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-g</code><dd><a name="index-g-760"></a>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

     <p>On most systems that use stabs format, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <samp><span class="option">-gstabs+</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-gstabs</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-gxcoff+</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-gxcoff</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-gvms</span></samp> (see below).

     <br><dt><code>-ggdb</code><dd><a name="index-ggdb-761"></a>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.

     <br><dt><code>-gdwarf</code><dt><code>-gdwarf-</code><var>version</var><dd><a name="index-gdwarf-762"></a>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported). 
The value of <var>version</var> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version
for most targets is 4.  DWARF Version 5 is only experimental.

     <p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.

     <p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <samp><span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span></samp>
for maximum benefit.

     <p>GCC no longer supports DWARF Version 1, which is substantially
different than Version 2 and later.  For historical reasons, some
other DWARF-related options such as
<samp><span class="option">-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</span></samp>) retain a reference to DWARF Version 2
in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs-763"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX. 
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs+</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs_002b-764"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff-765"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff+</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff_002b-766"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.

     <br><dt><code>-gvms</code><dd><a name="index-gvms-767"></a>Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems.

     <br><dt><code>-g</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-ggdb</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gstabs</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gvms</code><var>level</var><dd>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

     <p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <samp><span class="option">-g0</span></samp> negates
<samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>.

     <p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.

     <p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <samp><span class="option">-g3</span></samp>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-gdwarf</span></samp> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid
confusion with <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-</span><var>level</var></samp>. 
Instead use an additional <samp><span class="option">-g</span><var>level</var></samp> option to change the
debug level for DWARF.

     <br><dt><code>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</code><dd><a name="index-feliminate_002dunused_002ddebug_002dsymbols-768"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.

     <br><dt><code>-femit-class-debug-always</code><dd><a name="index-femit_002dclass_002ddebug_002dalways-769"></a>Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-merge-debug-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002ddebug_002dstrings-770"></a><a name="index-fno_002dmerge_002ddebug_002dstrings-771"></a>Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-fdebug-prefix-map=</code><var>old</var><code>=</code><var>new</var><dd><a name="index-fdebug_002dprefix_002dmap-772"></a>When compiling files residing in directory <samp><var>old</var></samp>, record
debugging information describing them as if the files resided in
directory <samp><var>new</var></samp> instead.  This can be used to replace a
build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.  It can
also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using
<samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> for <var>new</var>.  This can give more reproducible builds, which
are location independent, but may require an extra command to tell GDB
where to find the source files. See also <samp><span class="option">-ffile-prefix-map</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvar-tracking</code><dd><a name="index-fvar_002dtracking-773"></a>Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).

     <p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <small class="dots">...</small>), debugging information (<samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>) and
the debug info format supports it.

     <br><dt><code>-fvar-tracking-assignments</code><dd><a name="index-fvar_002dtracking_002dassignments-774"></a><a name="index-fno_002dvar_002dtracking_002dassignments-775"></a>Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the
way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.  Use of <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-4</span></samp> is recommended along with it.

     <p>It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end. 
By default, this flag is enabled together with <samp><span class="option">-fvar-tracking</span></samp>,
except when selective scheduling is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-gsplit-dwarf</code><dd><a name="index-gsplit_002ddwarf-776"></a>Separate as much DWARF debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension <samp><span class="file">.dwo</span></samp>.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading <samp><span class="file">.dwo</span></samp>
files.

     <br><dt><code>-gpubnames</code><dd><a name="index-gpubnames-777"></a>Generate DWARF <code>.debug_pubnames</code> and <code>.debug_pubtypes</code> sections.

     <br><dt><code>-ggnu-pubnames</code><dd><a name="index-ggnu_002dpubnames-778"></a>Generate <code>.debug_pubnames</code> and <code>.debug_pubtypes</code> sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a GDB index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce GDB index version 7.

     <br><dt><code>-fdebug-types-section</code><dd><a name="index-fdebug_002dtypes_002dsection-779"></a><a name="index-fno_002ddebug_002dtypes_002dsection-780"></a>When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own <code>.debug_types</code> section instead of making them part of the
<code>.debug_info</code> section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates. 
But not all DWARF consumers support <code>.debug_types</code> sections yet
and on some objects <code>.debug_types</code> produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.

     <br><dt><code>-grecord-gcc-switches</code><dt><code>-gno-record-gcc-switches</code><dd><a name="index-grecord_002dgcc_002dswitches-781"></a><a name="index-gno_002drecord_002dgcc_002dswitches-782"></a>This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version. 
It is enabled by default. 
See also <samp><span class="option">-frecord-gcc-switches</span></samp> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-gstrict-dwarf</code><dd><a name="index-gstrict_002ddwarf-783"></a>Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected
with <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-</span><var>version</var></samp>.  On most targets using non-conflicting
DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.

     <br><dt><code>-gno-strict-dwarf</code><dd><a name="index-gno_002dstrict_002ddwarf-784"></a>Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with
<samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-</span><var>version</var></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-gas-loc-support</code><dd><a name="index-gas_002dloc_002dsupport-785"></a>Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <code>.loc</code> directives. 
It may then use them for the assembler to generate DWARF2+ line number
tables.

     <p>This is generally desirable, because assembler-generated line-number
tables are a lot more compact than those the compiler can generate
itself.

     <p>This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the
assembler was found to support such directives.

     <br><dt><code>-gno-as-loc-support</code><dd><a name="index-gno_002das_002dloc_002dsupport-786"></a>Force GCC to generate DWARF2+ line number tables internally, if DWARF2+
line number tables are to be generated.

     <br><dt><code>gas-locview-support</code><dd><a name="index-gas_002dlocview_002dsupport-787"></a>Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <code>view</code> assignment
and reset assertion checking in <code>.loc</code> directives.

     <p>This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the
assembler was found to support them.

     <br><dt><code>gno-as-locview-support</code><dd>Force GCC to assign view numbers internally, if
<samp><span class="option">-gvariable-location-views</span></samp> are explicitly requested.

     <br><dt><code>-gcolumn-info</code><dt><code>-gno-column-info</code><dd><a name="index-gcolumn_002dinfo-788"></a><a name="index-gno_002dcolumn_002dinfo-789"></a>Emit location column information into DWARF debugging information, rather
than just file and line. 
This option is enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-gstatement-frontiers</code><dt><code>-gno-statement-frontiers</code><dd><a name="index-gstatement_002dfrontiers-790"></a><a name="index-gno_002dstatement_002dfrontiers-791"></a>This option causes GCC to create markers in the internal representation
at the beginning of statements, and to keep them roughly in place
throughout compilation, using them to guide the output of <code>is_stmt</code>
markers in the line number table.  This is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization (<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>,
<small class="dots">...</small>), and outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level.

     <br><dt><code>-gvariable-location-views</code><dt><code>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</code><dt><code>-gno-variable-location-views</code><dd><a name="index-gvariable_002dlocation_002dviews-792"></a><a name="index-gvariable_002dlocation_002dviews_003dincompat5-793"></a><a name="index-gno_002dvariable_002dlocation_002dviews-794"></a>Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers implied
from the line number table.  This enables debug information consumers to
inspect state at certain points of the program, even if no instructions
associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that
point.  If the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number
tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number table,
which generally makes them somewhat less compact.  The augmented line
number tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they
can be consumed by debug information consumers that are not aware of
these augmentations, but they won't derive any benefit from them either.

     <p>This is enabled by default when outputting DWARF 2 debug information at
the normal level, as long as there is assembler support,
<samp><span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span></samp> is enabled and
<samp><span class="option">-gstrict-dwarf</span></samp> is not.  When assembler support is not
available, this may still be enabled, but it will force GCC to output
internal line number tables, and if
<samp><span class="option">-ginternal-reset-location-views</span></samp> is not enabled, that will most
certainly lead to silently mismatching location views.

     <p>There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward
compatible with the location list format introduced in DWARF 5, that can
be enabled with <samp><span class="option">-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</span></samp>.  This
option may be removed in the future, is only provided as a reference
implementation of the proposed representation.  Debug information
consumers are not expected to support this extended format, and they
would be rendered unable to decode location lists using it.

     <br><dt><code>-ginternal-reset-location-views</code><dt><code>-gnointernal-reset-location-views</code><dd><a name="index-ginternal_002dreset_002dlocation_002dviews-795"></a><a name="index-gno_002dinternal_002dreset_002dlocation_002dviews-796"></a>Attempt to determine location views that can be omitted from location
view lists.  This requires the compiler to have very accurate insn
length estimates, which isn't always the case, and it may cause
incorrect view lists to be generated silently when using an assembler
that does not support location view lists.  The GNU assembler will flag
any such error as a <code>view number mismatch</code>.  This is only enabled
on ports that define a reliable estimation function.

     <br><dt><code>-ginline-points</code><dt><code>-gno-inline-points</code><dd><a name="index-ginline_002dpoints-797"></a><a name="index-gno_002dinline_002dpoints-798"></a>Generate extended debug information for inlined functions.  Location
view tracking markers are inserted at inlined entry points, so that
address and view numbers can be computed and output in debug
information.  This can be enabled independently of location views, in
which case the view numbers won't be output, but it can only be enabled
along with statement frontiers, and it is only enabled by default if
location views are enabled.

The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.

     <p>This option is a detailed version of
<samp><span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</span></samp>,
which serves for most needs.

     <p>A specification has the syntax<br>
[&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dir:</span></samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ind:</span></samp>&rsquo;][&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ord:</span></samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gen:</span></samp>&rsquo;](&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">any</span></samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sys</span></samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base</span></samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;)

     <p>The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dir:</span></samp>&rsquo;) or used indirectly (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ind:</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member. 
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs. 
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect. 
An example is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ord:</span></samp>&rsquo;) or generic structs (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gen:</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain. 
For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above. 
Other programming languages have generics,
but <samp><span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</span></samp> does not yet implement them.

     <p>The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information. 
The values &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">any</span></samp>&rsquo; have the normal meaning. 
The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base</span></samp>&rsquo; means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file. 
In practice, this means that when compiling <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and <samp><span class="file">foo.h</span></samp>,
but not other header files. 
The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sys</span></samp>&rsquo; means those types satisfying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base</span></samp>&rsquo;
or declared in system or compiler headers.

     <p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</span></samp>.

     <p>This option works only with DWARF debug output.

output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled. 
Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.

<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-optimize-options-807"></a><a name="index-options_002c-optimization-808"></a>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 <p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.

 <p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

 <p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.

 <p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

 <p>Most optimizations are only enabled if an <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.

 <p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <samp><span class="option">-Q --help=optimizers</span></samp>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.

 <p>If you use multiple <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.

 <p>Options of the form <samp><span class="option">-f</span><var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent

 <p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You

parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

     <p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit</span></samp> that results
in default behavior.

     <p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport-831"></a>This is a more fine-grained version of <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <code>dllexport</code>
attribute or declspec.  See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Declaring Attributes of Functions</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-832"></a>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dfunctions-833"></a>Emit <code>static</code> functions into the object file, even if the function
is never used.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts-834"></a>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     <p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-keep-static-consts</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dconstants-835"></a>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.

     <p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-merge-constants</span></samp> to inhibit this
behavior.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dall_002dconstants-836"></a>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

     <p>This option implies <samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp>.  In addition to
<samp><span class="option">-fmerge-constants</span></samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code><dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched-837"></a>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.

     <br><dt><code>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</code><dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched_002dallow_002dregmoves-838"></a>Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<samp><span class="option">-fmodulo-sched</span></samp> enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbranch_002dcount_002dreg-839"></a>Avoid running a pass scanning for opportunities to use &ldquo;decrement and
branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register instead of generating sequences
of instructions that decrement a register, compare it against zero, and
then branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
IA-64 and S/390.  Note that the <samp><span class="option">-fno-branch-count-reg</span></samp> option
doesn't remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.

     <p>Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and higher.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-count-reg</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dfunction_002dcse-840"></a>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.

     <p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-ffunction-cse</span></samp>

     <br><dt><code>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dzero_002dinitialized_002din_002dbss-841"></a>If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting
code.

     <p>This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section&mdash;e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fzero-initialized-in-bss</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fthread-jumps</code><dd><a name="index-fthread_002djumps-842"></a>Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsplit-wide-types</code><dd><a name="index-fsplit_002dwide_002dtypes-843"></a>When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as <code>long
long</code> on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcse-follow-jumps</code><dd><a name="index-fcse_002dfollow_002djumps-844"></a>In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an <code>if</code> statement with an
<code>else</code> clause, CSE follows the jump when the condition
tested is false.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcse-skip-blocks</code><dd><a name="index-fcse_002dskip_002dblocks-845"></a>This is similar to <samp><span class="option">-fcse-follow-jumps</span></samp>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple <code>if</code> statement with no else clause,
<samp><span class="option">-fcse-skip-blocks</span></samp> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the <code>if</code>.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code><dd><a name="index-frerun_002dcse_002dafter_002dloop-846"></a>Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations are
performed.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse-847"></a>Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. 
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.

     <p><em>Note:</em> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
<samp><span class="option">-fno-gcse</span></samp> to the command line.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse-lm</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse_002dlm-848"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-lm</span></samp> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination
attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.

     <p>Enabled by default when <samp><span class="option">-fgcse</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse-sm</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse_002dsm-849"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-sm</span></samp> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-lm</span></samp>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.

     <p>Not enabled at any optimization level.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse-las</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse_002dlas-850"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-las</span></samp> is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

     <p>Not enabled at any optimization level.

     <br><dt><code>-fgcse-after-reload</code><dd><a name="index-fgcse_002dafter_002dreload-851"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-fgcse-after-reload</span></samp> is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.

     <br><dt><code>-faggressive-loop-optimizations</code><dd><a name="index-faggressive_002dloop_002doptimizations-852"></a>This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations. 
This option is enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-funconstrained-commons</code><dd><a name="index-funconstrained_002dcommons-853"></a>This option tells the compiler that variables declared in common blocks
(e.g. Fortran) may later be overridden with longer trailing arrays. This
prevents certain optimizations that depend on knowing the array bounds.

     <br><dt><code>-fcrossjumping</code><dd><a name="index-fcrossjumping-854"></a>Perform cross-jumping transformation. 
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fauto-inc-dec</code><dd><a name="index-fauto_002dinc_002ddec-855"></a>Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses. 
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and
higher on architectures that support this.

     <br><dt><code>-fdce</code><dd><a name="index-fdce-856"></a>Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fdse</code><dd><a name="index-fdse-857"></a>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fif-conversion</code><dd><a name="index-fif_002dconversion-858"></a>Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by <samp><span class="option">-fif-conversion2</span></samp>.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fif-conversion2</code><dd><a name="index-fif_002dconversion2-859"></a>Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdeclone-ctor-dtor</code><dd><a name="index-fdeclone_002dctor_002ddtor-860"></a>The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards. 
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
implementation.

     <p>Enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</code><dd><a name="index-fdelete_002dnull_002dpointer_002dchecks-861"></a>Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides at address zero. 
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.

     <p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true. 
Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</span></samp> to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.

     <p>This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios II ELF, it
defaults to off.  On AVR, CR16, and MSP430, this option is completely disabled.

     <p>Passes that use the dataflow information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.

     <br><dt><code>-fdevirtualize</code><dd><a name="index-fdevirtualize-862"></a>Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (<samp><span class="option">-findirect-inlining</span></samp>) and interprocedural constant
propagation (<samp><span class="option">-fipa-cp</span></samp>). 
Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</code><dd><a name="index-fdevirtualize_002dspeculatively-863"></a>Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls. 
Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem
useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.

     <br><dt><code>-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans</code><dd><a name="index-fdevirtualize_002dat_002dltrans-864"></a>Stream extra information needed for aggressive devirtualization when running
the link-time optimizer in local transformation mode. 
This option enables more devirtualization but
significantly increases the size of streamed data. For this reason it is
disabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-fexpensive-optimizations</code><dd><a name="index-fexpensive_002doptimizations-865"></a>Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-free</code><dd><a name="index-free-866"></a>Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is especially
helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit
registers after writing to their lower 32-bit half.

     <p>Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-lifetime-dse</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dlifetime_002ddse-867"></a>In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use <samp><span class="option">-flifetime-dse=1</span></samp>.  The default behavior can be
explicitly selected with <samp><span class="option">-flifetime-dse=2</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="option">-flifetime-dse=0</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fno-lifetime-dse</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-flive-range-shrinkage</code><dd><a name="index-flive_002drange_002dshrinkage-868"></a>Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live range
shrinkage.  This is helpful for fast processors with small or moderate
size register sets.

     <br><dt><code>-fira-algorithm=</code><var>algorithm</var><dd><a name="index-fira_002dalgorithm-869"></a>Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The <var>algorithm</var> argument can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">priority</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CB</span></samp>&rsquo;, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.

     <br><dt><code>-fira-region=</code><var>region</var><dd><a name="index-fira_002dregion-870"></a>Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
<var>region</var> argument should be one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Use all loops as register allocation regions. 
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mixed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure
as the regions.  This value usually gives
the best results in most cases and for most architectures,
and is enabled by default when compiling with optimization for speed
(<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <small class="dots">...</small>).

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">one</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Use all functions as a single region. 
This typically results in the smallest code size, and is enabled by default for
<samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>-fira-hoist-pressure</code><dd><a name="index-fira_002dhoist_002dpressure-871"></a>Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting pass for
decisions to hoist expressions.  This option usually results in smaller
code, but it can slow the compiler down.

     <p>This option is enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> for all targets.

     <br><dt><code>-fira-loop-pressure</code><dd><a name="index-fira_002dloop_002dpressure-872"></a>Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move
loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (&gt;= 32
registers), but it can slow the compiler down.

     <p>This option is enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> for some targets.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-ira-share-save-slots</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dira_002dshare_002dsave_002dslots-873"></a>Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard
registers living through a call.  Each hard register gets a
separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
larger.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-ira-share-spill-slots</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dira_002dshare_002dspill_002dslots-874"></a>Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each
pseudo-register that does not get a hard register gets a separate
stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.

     <br><dt><code>-flra-remat</code><dd><a name="index-flra_002dremat-875"></a>Enable CFG-sensitive rematerialization in LRA.  Instead of loading
values of spilled pseudos, LRA tries to rematerialize (recalculate)
values if it is profitable.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating-point instruction is required.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fschedule-insns2</code><dd><a name="index-fschedule_002dinsns2-878"></a>Similar to <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-sched-interblock</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dsched_002dinterblock-879"></a>Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. 
with <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp> or at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-sched-spec</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dsched_002dspec-880"></a>Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. 
with <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp> or at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fsched-pressure</code><dd><a name="index-fsched_002dpressure-881"></a>Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp> or at
<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the
generated code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
increase above the number of available hard registers and subsequent
spills in register allocation.

     <br><dt><code>-fsched-spec-load</code><dd><a name="index-fsched_002dspec_002dload-882"></a>Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes

     <br><dt><code>-fsched2-use-superblocks</code><dd><a name="index-fsched2_002duse_002dsuperblocks-886"></a>When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock scheduling. 
This allows motion across basic block boundaries,
resulting in faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

     <p>This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
<samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns2</span></samp> or at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or higher.

the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.  This is enabled
by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns2</span></samp> or at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or higher.

favors the instruction that has more instructions depending on it. 
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. 
with <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fschedule-insns2</span></samp> or

Use this option to control that behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fselective-scheduling</code><dd><a name="index-fselective_002dscheduling-894"></a>Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective
scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.

     <br><dt><code>-fsel-sched-pipelining</code><dd><a name="index-fsel_002dsched_002dpipelining-896"></a>Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling. 
This option has no effect unless one of <samp><span class="option">-fselective-scheduling</span></samp> or

     <br><dt><code>-fsemantic-interposition</code><dd><a name="index-fsemantic_002dinterposition-898"></a>Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the
dynamic linker. 
This means that for symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality. 
With <samp><span class="option">-fno-semantic-interposition</span></samp> the compiler assumes that
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag
has no effect for functions explicitly declared inline
(where it is never allowed for interposition to change semantics)
and for symbols explicitly declared weak.

     <br><dt><code>-fshrink-wrap</code><dd><a name="index-fshrink_002dwrap-899"></a>Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it,

     <br><dt><code>-fshrink-wrap-separate</code><dd><a name="index-fshrink_002dwrap_002dseparate-900"></a>Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue separately, so that
those parts are only executed when needed. 
This option is on by default, but has no effect unless <samp><span class="option">-fshrink-wrap</span></samp>
is also turned on and the target supports this.

     <br><dt><code>-fcaller-saves</code><dd><a name="index-fcaller_002dsaves-901"></a>Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code.

     <p>This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</code><dd><a name="index-fcombine_002dstack_002dadjustments-902"></a>Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-ra</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dra-903"></a>Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-pg</span></samp>) or if callee's register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in RTL).

     <br><dt><code>-fconserve-stack</code><dd><a name="index-fconserve_002dstack-904"></a>Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the <samp><span class="option">large-stack-frame</span></samp> parameter to 100
and the <samp><span class="option">large-stack-frame-growth</span></samp> parameter to 400.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-reassoc</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dreassoc-905"></a>Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default

     <br><dt><code>-fcode-hoisting</code><dd><a name="index-fcode_002dhoisting-906"></a>Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-pre</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dpre-907"></a>Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag is

at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-fre</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dfre-910"></a>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation. 
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-phiprop</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dphiprop-911"></a>Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</code><dd><a name="index-fhoist_002dadjacent_002dloads-912"></a>Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-copy-prop</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopy_002dprop-913"></a>Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and
higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-pure-const</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpure_002dconst-914"></a>Discover which functions are pure or constant. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-reference</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dreference-915"></a>Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-pta</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpta-916"></a>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-profile</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dprofile-917"></a>Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<code>cold</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-cp</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp-918"></a>Perform interprocedural constant propagation. 
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly. 
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-cp-clone</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp_002dclone-919"></a>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger. 
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments. 
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <samp><span class="option">--param ipcp-unit-growth=</span><var>value</var></samp>). 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-bit-cp</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_002dfipa_002dbit_002dcp-920"></a>When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>. It
requires that <samp><span class="option">-fipa-cp</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-vrp</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_002dfipa_002dvrp-921"></a>When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>. It requires
that <samp><span class="option">-fipa-cp</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-icf</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dicf-922"></a>Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables. 
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.

     <p>Nevertheless the behavior is similar to Gold Linker ICF optimization, GCC ICF
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are
equivalences that are found only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold.

     <p>This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</code><dd><a name="index-fisolate_002derroneous_002dpaths_002ddereference-923"></a>Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to

This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher and depends on

pointer alignment information. 
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.  It requires that <samp><span class="option">-ftree-ccp</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-ccp</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dccp-927"></a>Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on trees.  This

     <br><dt><code>-fssa-backprop</code><dd><a name="index-fssa_002dbackprop-928"></a>Propagate information about uses of a value up the definition chain
in order to simplify the definitions.  For example, this pass strips

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-tail-merge</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dtail_002dmerge-931"></a>Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using <samp><span class="option">max-tail-merge-comparisons</span></samp> parameter and

propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-dse</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002ddse-935"></a>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-ch</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dch-936"></a>Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.  It is not enabled

     <br><dt><code>-fgraphite-identity</code><dd><a name="index-fgraphite_002didentity-941"></a>Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
<samp><span class="option">-fgraphite-identity</span></samp> we can check the costs or benefits of the
GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.

     <br><dt><code>-floop-nest-optimize</code><dd><a name="index-floop_002dnest_002doptimize-942"></a>Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop

profitable to parallelize the loops.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-coalesce-vars</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcoalesce_002dvars-944"></a>While transforming the program out of the SSA representation, attempt to
reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined
variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.  This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-fno-var-tracking-assignments</span></samp>.  In the negated form, this flag
prevents SSA coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-if-convert</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dif_002dconvert-945"></a>Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-loop-distribution</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002ddistribution-946"></a>Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like

With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">unlimited</span></samp>&rsquo; model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo; model a runtime check
guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration

constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.  Null pointer check

functions such as <code>sprintf</code>, <code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsprintf</code>, and

transformation allows GCC to optimize or even eliminate branches based
on the known return value of these functions called with arguments that
are either constant, or whose values are known to be in a range that
makes determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when
<samp><span class="option">-fprintf-return-value</span></samp> is in effect, both the branch and the
body of the <code>if</code> statement (but not the call to <code>snprint</code>)
can be optimized away when <code>i</code> is a 32-bit or smaller integer
because the return value is guaranteed to be at most 8.

     <p>GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing-979"></a>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

     <p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most

<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.  See <a href="#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:

          }
</pre>
     <p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:

     <br><dt><code>-fno-toplevel-reorder</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dtoplevel_002dreorder-985"></a>Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and <code>asm</code>
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
are not removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
that relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes when possible.

     <p>Enabled at level <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp>.  When disabled explicitly, it also implies
<samp><span class="option">-fno-section-anchors</span></samp>, which is otherwise enabled at <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp> on some
targets.

     <br><dt><code>-fweb</code><dd><a name="index-fweb-986"></a>Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a
&ldquo;home register&rdquo;.

     <p>Enabled by default with <samp><span class="option">-funroll-loops</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fwhole-program</code><dd><a name="index-fwhole_002dprogram-987"></a>Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of <code>main</code>
and those merged by attribute <code>externally_visible</code> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.

     <p>This option should not be used in combination with <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp>. 
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.

     <br><dt><code>-flto[=</code><var>n</var><code>]</code><dd><a name="index-flto-988"></a>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.

     <p>To use the link-time optimizer, <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link. 
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time. 
For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</pre>
     <p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> into functions in <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and vice-versa.

     <p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</pre>
     <p>The above generates bytecode for <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.c</span></samp>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <samp><span class="file">myprog</span></samp>.

     <p>The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step. 
GCC then automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> command-line option. 
You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for link-time
optimization though GCC tries to be clever at guessing an
optimization level to use from the options used at compile time
if you fail to specify one at link time.  You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing <samp><span class="option">-fno-lto</span></samp> to the link command.

     <p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.

     <p>When <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp> is not enabled, when a file is
compiled with <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp>, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <samp><span class="option">-ffat-lto-objects</span></samp>.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <samp><span class="option">-fno-lto</span></samp> is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
<samp><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span></samp> is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.

     <p>Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -O3 foo.o bar.o
</pre>
     <p>This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary <samp><span class="file">myprog</span></samp> is optimized at
<samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.  If, instead, the final binary is generated with
<samp><span class="option">-fno-lto</span></samp>, then <samp><span class="file">myprog</span></samp> is not optimized.

     <p>When producing the final binary, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode. 
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.

     <p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Generally options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time.

     <p>If you do not specify an optimization level option <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> at
link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level
used when compiling the object files.

     <p>Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them:
<samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fcommon</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fexceptions</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fnon-call-exceptions</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span></samp>
and all the <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> target flags.

     <p>Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as <samp><span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>.

     <p>Other options such as <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fno-trapv</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-aliasing</span></samp>
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
<samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-trapv</span></samp> take
precedence; and for example <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=off</span></samp> takes precedence
over <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span></samp>.  You can override them at link time.

     <p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.

     <p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -flto foo.c
          g++ -c -flto bar.cc
          gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
          g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</pre>
     <p>Notice that the final link is done with <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <samp><span class="option">-lgfortran</span></samp> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.

     <p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for LTO, use <samp><span class="command">gcc-ar</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gcc-ranlib</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">ranlib</span></samp>;
to show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use
<samp><span class="command">gcc-nm</span></samp>.  Those commands require that <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ranlib</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">nm</span></samp> have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the
flag <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp> to ensure that the library participates in
the LTO optimization process:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</pre>
     <p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

     <p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
<samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-ffat-lto-objects</span></samp>.

     <p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities. 
Use of <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>).

     <p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.

     <p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information on systems other than those using a combination of ELF and
DWARF.

     <p>If you specify the optional <var>n</var>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <var>n</var>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> program.  The
environment variable <samp><span class="env">MAKE</span></samp> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <var>n</var> is 1.

     <p>You can also specify <samp><span class="option">-flto=jobserver</span></samp> to use GNU make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel. 
You must prepend a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <samp><span class="env">MAKE</span></samp> is
GNU make.

     <br><dt><code>-flto-partition=</code><var>alg</var><dd><a name="index-flto_002dpartition-989"></a>Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer. 
The value is either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1to1</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">balanced</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">max</span></samp>&rsquo; to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">balanced</span></samp>&rsquo;. While &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1to1</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">max</span></samp>&rsquo;
partitioning is intended for internal testing only. 
The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">one</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies that exactly one partition should be
used while the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; bypasses partitioning and executes
the link-time optimization step directly from the WPA phase.

     <br><dt><code>-flto-odr-type-merging</code><dd><a name="index-flto_002dodr_002dtype_002dmerging-990"></a>Enable streaming of mangled types names of C++ types and their unification
at link time.  This increases size of LTO object files, but enables
diagnostics about One Definition Rule violations.

     <br><dt><code>-flto-compression-level=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-flto_002dcompression_002dlevel-991"></a>This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to LTO object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with LTO mode (<samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp>).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-linker-plugin</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dlinker_002dplugin-992"></a>Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.

     <p>This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp>. 
See <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.

     <p>This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled
and GCC was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).

     <br><dt><code>-ffat-lto-objects</code><dd><a name="index-ffat_002dlto_002dobjects-993"></a>Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both LTO linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp>
and is ignored at link time.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span></samp> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
<samp><span class="command">nm</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ranlib</span></samp>
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the <samp><span class="command">gcc-ar</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">gcc-nm</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">gcc-ranlib</span></samp> wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to use them.

     <p>Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism. 
Installing the linker plugin into <samp><span class="file">$libdir/bfd-plugins</span></samp> has the same
effect as usage of the command wrappers (<samp><span class="command">gcc-ar</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">gcc-nm</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">gcc-ranlib</span></samp>).

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span></samp> on targets with linker plugin
support.

</dl>

 <p>The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point
arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-ffloat-store</code><dd><a name="index-ffloat_002dstore-1000"></a>Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.

     <p><a name="index-floating_002dpoint-precision-1001"></a>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

     <br><dt><code>-fexcess-precision=</code><var>style</var><dd><a name="index-fexcess_002dprecision-1002"></a>This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the IEEE standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=fast</span></samp> is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place. 
When compiling C, if <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=standard</span></samp> is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> is used. 
<samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> enables <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=fast</span></samp> by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.

     <p><a name="index-mfpmath-1003"></a><samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=standard</span></samp> is not implemented for languages
other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if <samp><span class="option">-mfpmath=sse</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-mfpmath=sse+387</span></samp> is specified; in the former case, IEEE

     <p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
ELF object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.

     <p>Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <samp><span class="option">--gc-sections</span></samp>
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).

     <p>On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.

     <p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation. 
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.

     <p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.

     <p>In each case, the <var>value</var> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<var>name</var> are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>predictable-branch-outcome</code><dd>When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable. The default is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns</code><dd>RTL if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches around a block and
replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  This parameter
gives the maximum number of instructions in a block which should be
considered for if-conversion.  The default is 10, though the compiler will
also use other heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is likely to be
profitable.

          <br><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost</code><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-unpredictable-cost</code><dd>RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches around a block
and replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  These parameters
give the maximum permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated
by if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically determined
to be predictable or not.  The units for this parameter are the same as
those for the GCC internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to
provide a reasonable default for this parameter using the BRANCH_COST
target macro.

          <br><dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code><dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping. 
The algorithm used by <samp><span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span></samp> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.

          <br><dt><code>min-crossjump-insns</code><dd>The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
cross-jumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.

          <br><dt><code>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</code><dd>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction. 
The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-goto-duplication-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code><dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code><dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization is not done.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</code><dd>If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts or removes the expression and thus
leaves partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is 20.

          <br><dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code><dd>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.

          <br><dt><code>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</code><dd>The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC. 
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++). 
The default value is 400.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>When you use <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied. 
The default value is 30.

          <br><dt><code>inline-min-speedup</code><dd>When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in percent), the function can be inlined regardless of the limit on
<samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-single</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--param
max-inline-insns-auto</span></samp>. 
The default value is 15.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
<samp><span class="option">--param large-function-growth</span></samp>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end. 
The default value is 2700.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents. 
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-unit-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>. 
For small units this might be too tight. 
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <samp><span class="option">--param large-unit-insns</span></samp>
before applying <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>.  The default is 10000.

          <br><dt><code>inline-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining. 
The default value is 20 which limits unit growth to 1.2 times the original
size. Cold functions (either marked cold via an attribute or by profile
feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.

          <br><dt><code>ipcp-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame</code><dd>The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  The default value is 256 bytes.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents. 
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive</code><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</code><dd>Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

          <p><samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive</span></samp> applies to functions
declared inline. 
For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled; <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</span></samp> applies instead.  The
default value is 450.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth</code><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</code><dd>Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.

          <p><samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth</span></samp> applies to functions
declared inline.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled; <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</span></samp> applies instead.  The
default value is 8.

          <br><dt><code>min-inline-recursive-probability</code><dd>Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

          <p>When profile feedback is available (see <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from the probability that function recurses
via a given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call
expressions whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents). 
The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>early-inlining-insns</code><dd>Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases
the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty. 
The default value is 14.

          <br><dt><code>max-early-inliner-iterations</code><dd>Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds
the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner can resolve. 
Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.

          <br><dt><code>comdat-sharing-probability</code><dd>Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with comdat visibility
are shared across multiple compilation units.  The default value is 20.

          <br><dt><code>profile-func-internal-id</code><dd>A parameter to control whether to use function internal id in profile
database lookup. If the value is 0, the compiler uses an id that
is based on function assembler name and filename, which makes old profile
data more tolerant to source changes such as function reordering etc. 
The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>min-vect-loop-bound</code><dd>The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when <samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.

          <br><dt><code>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</code><dd>Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than <samp><span class="option">gcse-unrestricted-cost</span></samp>.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>gcse-unrestricted-cost</code><dd>Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances. 
The default value is 3.

          <br><dt><code>max-hoist-depth</code><dd>The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist. 
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm. 
The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.  The default value is 30.

          <br><dt><code>max-tail-merge-comparisons</code><dd>The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This is used to
avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.  The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-tail-merge-iterations</code><dd>The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the function.  This is used to
limit compilation time in tree tail merging.  The default value is 2.

          <br><dt><code>store-merging-allow-unaligned</code><dd>Allow the store merging pass to introduce unaligned stores if it is legal to
do so.  The default value is 1.

          <br><dt><code>max-stores-to-merge</code><dd>The maximum number of stores to attempt to merge into wider stores in the store
merging pass.  The minimum value is 2 and the default is 64.

          <br><dt><code>max-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be unrolled. 
If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-average-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled,
this parameter also determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-unroll-times</code><dd>The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be peeled. 
If a loop is peeled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-branches</code><dd>The maximum number of branches on the hot path through the peeled sequence.

          <br><dt><code>max-loop-headers-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns in loop header duplicated by the copy loop headers
pass.

          <br><dt><code>lim-expensive</code><dd>The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

          <br><dt><code>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</code><dd>Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below which
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  If there are more candidates than this,
only the most relevant ones are considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.

          <br><dt><code>iv-max-considered-uses</code><dd>The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.

          <br><dt><code>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</code><dd>If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set
when adding a new one.

          <br><dt><code>dse-max-object-size</code><dd>Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by dead store elimination. 
Larger values may result in larger compilation times.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-size</code><dd>Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Large expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-complexity</code><dd>Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Complex expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args</code><dd>Maximum number of arguments in a PHI supported by TREE if conversion
unless the loop is marked with simd pragma.

doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-for-alias-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-peeling-for-alignment</code><dd>The maximum number of loop peels to enhance access alignment
for vectorizer. Value -1 means no limit.

          <br><dt><code>max-iterations-to-track</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute-force algorithm
for analysis of the number of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-count-ws-permille</code><dd>The number of most executed permilles, ranging from 0 to 1000, of the
profiled execution of the entire program to which the execution count
of a basic block must be part of in order to be considered hot.  The
default is 999, which means that a basic block is considered hot if
its execution count contributes to the upper 999 permilles, or 99.9%,
of the profiled execution of the entire program.  0 means that it is
never considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</code><dd>The denominator n of fraction 1/n of the execution frequency of the
entry block of a function that a basic block of this function needs
to at least have in order to be considered hot.  The default is 1000,
which means that a basic block is considered hot in a function if it
is executed more frequently than 1/1000 of the frequency of the entry
block of the function.  0 means that it is never considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>unlikely-bb-count-fraction</code><dd>The denominator n of fraction 1/n of the number of profiled runs of
the entire program below which the execution count of a basic block
must be in order for the basic block to be considered unlikely executed. 
The default is 20, which means that a basic block is considered unlikely
executed if it is executed in fewer than 1/20, or 5%, of the runs of
the program.  0 means that it is always considered unlikely executed.

          <br><dt><code>max-predicted-iterations</code><dd>The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound. 
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative to the other one.

          <br><dt><code>builtin-expect-probability</code><dd>Control the probability of the expression having the specified value. This
parameter takes a percentage (i.e. 0 ... 100) as input. 
The default probability of 90 is obtained empirically.

          <br><dt><code>align-threshold</code><dd>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of a basic block in
a function to align the basic block.

          <br><dt><code>align-loop-iterations</code><dd>
A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of iterations is
aligned.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage</code><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</code><dd>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</span></samp> parameter
is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-max-code-growth</code><dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
a rather artificial limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dd>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-probability</code><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</code><dd>
Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this
threshold.

          <p>Similarly to <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage</span></samp> two parameters are
provided.  <samp><span class="option">tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</span></samp> is used for
compilation with profile feedback and <samp><span class="option">tracer-min-branch-probability</span></samp>
compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile feedback
needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer
effective.

          <br><dt><code>stack-clash-protection-guard-size</code><dd>Specify the size of the operating system provided stack guard as
2 raised to <var>num</var> bytes.  The default value is 12 (4096 bytes). 
Acceptable values are between 12 and 30.  Higher values may reduce the
number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system
provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.

          <br><dt><code>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval</code><dd>Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This
param controls the maximum distance between probes into the stack as 2 raised
to <var>num</var> bytes.  Acceptable values are between 10 and 16 and defaults to
12.  Higher values may reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value
larger than the operating system provided guard will leave code vulnerable to
stack clash style attacks.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-path-length</code><dd>
The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE considers. 
The default is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before flushing. 
The default is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-expand</code><dd>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections. 
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <code>getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of &ldquo;RAM&rdquo; is
the smallest of actual RAM and <code>RLIMIT_DATA</code> or <code>RLIMIT_AS</code>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-heapsize</code><dd>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp>% beyond <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

          <br><dt><code>max-reload-search-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compilation time increase with probably slightly better performance. 
The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-cselib-memory-locations</code><dd>The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account. 
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-ready-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-blocks</code><dd>The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>max-pipeline-region-blocks</code><dd>The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 15.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-region-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.

          <br><dt><code>max-pipeline-region-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 200.

          <br><dt><code>min-spec-prob</code><dd>The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source block
for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend regions. 
A value of 0 (the default) disables region extensions.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay</code><dd>The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for speculative motion. 
The default value is 3.

          <br><dt><code>sched-spec-prob-cutoff</code><dd>The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents), so that
speculative insns are scheduled. 
The default value is 40.

          <br><dt><code>sched-state-edge-prob-cutoff</code><dd>The minimum probability an edge must have for the scheduler to save its
state across it. 
The default value is 10.

          <br><dt><code>sched-mem-true-dep-cost</code><dd>Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load targeting same
memory locations.  The default value is 1.

          <br><dt><code>selsched-max-lookahead</code><dd>The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective scheduling.  It is a
depth of search for available instructions. 
The default value is 50.

          <br><dt><code>selsched-max-sched-times</code><dd>The maximum number of times that an instruction is scheduled during
selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined.  The default value is 2.

          <br><dt><code>selsched-insns-to-rename</code><dd>The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered
for renaming in the selective scheduler.  The default value is 2.

          <br><dt><code>sms-min-sc</code><dd>The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo scheduler
generates.  The default value is 2.

          <br><dt><code>max-last-value-rtl</code><dd>The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.  The default
is 10000.

          <br><dt><code>max-combine-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions the RTL combiner tries to combine. 
The default value is 2 at <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> and 4 otherwise.

          <br><dt><code>integer-share-limit</code><dd>Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.  The default value is 256.

          <br><dt><code>ssp-buffer-size</code><dd>The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack smashing
protection when <samp><span class="option">-fstack-protection</span></samp> is used.

          <br><dt><code>min-size-for-stack-sharing</code><dd>The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot sharing when not
optimizing. The default value is 32.

          <br><dt><code>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</code><dd>Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.

          <br><dt><code>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</code><dd>Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
for <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp>,
and 100 for <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-latency</code><dd>Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <samp><span class="option">simultaneous-prefetches</span></samp>).

          <br><dt><code>simultaneous-prefetches</code><dd>Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

          <br><dt><code>l1-cache-line-size</code><dd>The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.

          <br><dt><code>loop-interchange-stride-ratio</code><dd>The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for interchange to be profitable.

          <br><dt><code>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio</code><dd>The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio</code><dd>The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.

          <br><dt><code>use-canonical-types</code><dd>Whether the compiler should use the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; type system.  By
default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.

          <br><dt><code>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</code><dd>Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are
bigger than <samp><span class="option">switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</span></samp> times the number of
branches in the switch.

          <br><dt><code>max-partial-antic-length</code><dd>Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (<samp><span class="option">-ftree-pre</span></samp>) when
optimizing at <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.

          <br><dt><code>sccvn-max-scc-size</code><dd>Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during SCCVN
processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for the whole
function is not done and optimizations depending on it are
disabled.  The default maximum SCC size is 10000.

          <br><dt><code>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</code><dd>Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry. 
The default maximum number of queries is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>ira-max-loops-num</code><dd>IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.

          <br><dt><code>ira-max-conflict-table-size</code><dd>Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table. 
The default value of the parameter is 2000.

          <br><dt><code>ira-loop-reserved-regs</code><dd>IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2, which is
the minimal number of registers needed by typical instructions. 
This value is the best found from numerous experiments.

          <br><dt><code>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff</code><dd>LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in subsequent insns. 
This optimization is called inheritance.  EBB is used as a region to
do this optimization.  The parameter defines a minimal fall-through
edge probability in percentage used to add BB to inheritance EBB in
LRA.  The default value of the parameter is 40.  The value was chosen
from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.

          <br><dt><code>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</code><dd>Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and 10000 for <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and above.

          <br><dt><code>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</code><dd>Building data dependencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies. 
The default value is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>max-vartrack-size</code><dd>Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.

          <br><dt><code>max-vartrack-expr-depth</code><dd>Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.

          <br><dt><code>max-debug-marker-count</code><dd>Sets a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g. begin stmt
markers) to avoid complexity explosion at inlining or expanding to RTL. 
If a function has more such gimple stmts than the set limit, such stmts
will be dropped from the inlined copy of a function, and from its RTL
expansion.  The default is 100000.

          <br><dt><code>min-nondebug-insn-uid</code><dd>Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
<samp><span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span></samp>, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</code><dd>IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new
parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to
<samp><span class="option">ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</span></samp> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.

          <br><dt><code>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</code><dt><code>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</code><dd>The two Scalar Reduction of Aggregates passes (SRA and IPA-SRA) aim to
replace scalar parts of aggregates with uses of independent scalar
variables.  These parameters control the maximum size, in storage units,
of aggregate which is considered for replacement when compiling for
speed
(<samp><span class="option">sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</span></samp>) or size
(<samp><span class="option">sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</span></samp>) respectively.

          <br><dt><code>tm-max-aggregate-size</code><dd>When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<samp><span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</code><dd>To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters, a value of zero can be used to lift
the bound.  A variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and
defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.

          <br><dt><code>loop-block-tile-size</code><dd>Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
<samp><span class="option">-floop-block</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-floop-strip-mine</span></samp>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the <samp><span class="option">loop-block-tile-size</span></samp>
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.

          <br><dt><code>loop-unroll-jam-size</code><dd>Specify the unroll factor for the <samp><span class="option">-floop-unroll-and-jam</span></samp> option.  The
default value is 4.

          <br><dt><code>loop-unroll-jam-depth</code><dd>Specify the dimension to be unrolled (counting from the most inner loop)
for the  <samp><span class="option">-floop-unroll-and-jam</span></samp>.  The default value is 2.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-value-list-size</code><dd>IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization. 
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-value-list-size</span></samp> is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</code><dd>IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics
and performs those cloning opportunities with scores that exceed
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-eval-threshold</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-recursion-penalty</code><dd>Percentage penalty the recursive functions will receive when they
are evaluated for cloning.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty</code><dd>Percentage penalty functions containing a single call to another
function will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-max-agg-items</code><dd>IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed
in an aggregate. <samp><span class="option">ipa-max-agg-items</span></samp> controls the maximum
number of such values per one parameter.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</code><dd>When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the number
of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</span></samp> to the profitability score of
the candidate.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</code><dd>When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the index of
an array access known, it adds a bonus of
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</span></samp> to the profitability
score of the candidate.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-max-aa-steps</code><dd>During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs alias analysis
in order to track values pointed to by function parameters.  In order
not spend too much time analyzing huge functions, it gives up and
consider all memory clobbered after examining
<samp><span class="option">ipa-max-aa-steps</span></samp> statements modifying memory.

          <br><dt><code>lto-partitions</code><dd>Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation. 
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation. 
The default value is 32.

          <br><dt><code>lto-min-partition</code><dd>Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions). 
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many
partitions.

          <br><dt><code>lto-max-partition</code><dd>Size of max partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).

Meant to be used only with balanced partitioning.

          <br><dt><code>cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help</code><dd>The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when C++
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.

          <br><dt><code>sink-frequency-threshold</code><dd>The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking. 
The default value is 75.  A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.

          <br><dt><code>max-stores-to-sink</code><dd>The maximum number of conditional store pairs that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (<samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp>) or if-conversion
(<samp><span class="option">-ftree-loop-if-convert</span></samp>) is disabled.  The default is 2.

          <br><dt><code>allow-store-data-races</code><dd>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores. 
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
at optimization level <samp><span class="option">-Ofast</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>case-values-threshold</code><dd>The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a

reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.

          <br><dt><code>sched-pressure-algorithm</code><dd>Choose between the two available implementations of
<samp><span class="option">-fsched-pressure</span></samp>.  Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered. 
Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively
conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive
approach taken by the default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on
having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes. 
See <samp><span class="file">haifa-sched.c</span></samp> in the GCC sources for more details.

          <p>The default choice depends on the target.

To disable memory reads protection use
<samp><span class="option">--param asan-instrument-reads=0</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>asan-instrument-writes</code><dd>Enable buffer overflow detection for memory writes.  This kind of

          <br><dt><code>asan-memintrin</code><dd>Enable detection for built-in functions.  This kind of protection
is enabled by default when using <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>.

<samp><span class="option">--param asan-memintrin=0</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>asan-use-after-return</code><dd>Enable detection of use-after-return.  This kind of protection
is enabled by default when using the <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp> option. 
To disable it use <samp><span class="option">--param asan-use-after-return=0</span></samp>.

          <p>Note: By default the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it,
add <code>detect_stack_use_after_return=1</code> to the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">ASAN_OPTIONS</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold</code><dd>If number of memory accesses in function being instrumented
is greater or equal to this number, use callbacks instead of inline checks. 
E.g. to disable inline code use
<samp><span class="option">--param asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold=0</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>use-after-scope-direct-emission-threshold</code><dd>If the size of a local variable in bytes is smaller or equal to this
number, directly poison (or unpoison) shadow memory instead of using
run-time callbacks.  The default value is 256.

          <br><dt><code>chkp-max-ctor-size</code><dd>Static constructors generated by Pointer Bounds Checker may become very
large and significantly increase compile time at optimization level
<samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and higher.  This parameter is a maximum number of statements

<h3 class="section">3.11 Program Instrumentation Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-instrumentation-options-1039"></a><a name="index-program-instrumentation-options-1040"></a><a name="index-run_002dtime-error-checking-options-1041"></a><a name="index-profiling-options-1042"></a><a name="index-options_002c-program-instrumentation-1043"></a><a name="index-options_002c-run_002dtime-error-checking-1044"></a><a name="index-options_002c-profiling-1045"></a>
GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates. 
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations. 
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking. 
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bprof_007d-1046"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-p</code><dd><a name="index-p-1047"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <samp><span class="command">prof</span></samp>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgprof_007d-1048"></a><br><dt><code>-pg</code><dd><a name="index-pg-1049"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002darcs-1050"></a>Add code so that program flow <dfn>arcs</dfn> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  On targets that support
constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used
as a type of a global variable.

     <p>When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>), or for
test coverage analysis (<samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp>).  Each object file's
<var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <samp><span class="file">foo.gcda</span></samp> for input file <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.c</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="file">dir/foo.gcda</span></samp> for output file specified as <samp><span class="option">-o dir/foo.o</span></samp>). 
See <a href="#Cross_002dprofiling">Cross-profiling</a>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgcov_007d-1051"></a><br><dt><code>--coverage</code><dd><a name="index-coverage-1052"></a>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
<samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp> (when compiling) and <samp><span class="option">-lgcov</span></samp> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.

          <ul>
<li>Compile the source files with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.

          <li>Compile the source files additionally with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-abs-path</span></samp>
to create absolute path names in the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> files.  This allows
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
occur with different working directories.

          <li>Link your object files with <samp><span class="option">-lgcov</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
(the latter implies the former).

          <li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless
a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, <code>fork</code> calls are
detected and correctly handled without double counting.

          <li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp> (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>).

          <li>For test coverage analysis, use <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to produce human readable
information from the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files.  Refer to the
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> documentation for further information.

     </ul>

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. 
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

     <br><dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code><dd><a name="index-ftest_002dcoverage-1053"></a>Produce a notes file that the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="#Gcov"><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>&mdash;a Test Coverage Program</a>) can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>.  Refer to the <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> option
above for a description of <var>auxname</var> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source files
more closely if you do not optimize.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-abs-path</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dabs_002dpath-1054"></a>Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names
in the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> files.  This allows <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to find the correct
sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
directories.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-dir=</code><var>path</var><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002ddir-1055"></a>
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <var>path</var>. 
This option affects only the profile data generated by
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
and used by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used. 
By default, GCC uses the current directory as <var>path</var>, thus the
profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-generate</code><dt><code>-fprofile-generate=</code><var>path</var><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dgenerate-1056"></a>
Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based

Alter the update method for an application instrumented for profile
feedback based optimization.  The <var>method</var> argument should be one of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">single</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The first one is useful for single-threaded applications,
while the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-safe code.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When an application does not properly join all threads
(or creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.

     <p>Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; would be transformed either to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atomic</span></samp>&rsquo;,
when supported by a target, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">single</span></samp>&rsquo; otherwise.  The GCC driver
automatically selects &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; when <samp><span class="option">-pthread</span></samp>

<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</span></samp> is not enabled by
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp>, since floating-point division by zero can

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dfloat_002dcast_002doverflow-1079"></a>This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking. 
We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow. 
Unlike other similar options, <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</span></samp> is
not enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp>. 
This option does not work well with <code>FE_INVALID</code> exceptions enabled.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dnonnull_002dattribute-1080"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values
are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dreturns_002dnonnull_002dattribute-1081"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions
marked with <code>returns_nonnull</code> function attribute, to detect returning
of null values from such functions.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=bool</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbool-1082"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other
than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=enum</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003denum-1083"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If
a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded,
a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=vptr</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dvptr-1084"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function calls, member
accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes,
to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer_002doverflow-1085"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of pointer arithmetics.  If the pointer
arithmetics overflows, a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=builtin</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbuiltin-1086"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of arguments to selected builtin
functions.  If an invalid value is passed to such arguments, a run-time
error is issued.  E.g. passing 0 as the argument to <code>__builtin_ctz</code>
or <code>__builtin_clz</code> invokes undefined behavior and is diagnosed
by this option.

     </dl>

     <p>While <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp> gives a diagnostic message. 
This currently works only for the C family of languages.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-sanitize=all</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dsanitize_003dall-1087"></a>
This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers. 
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=all</span></samp> is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be used
together.

     <br><dt><code>-fasan-shadow-offset=</code><var>number</var><dd><a name="index-fasan_002dshadow_002doffset-1088"></a>This option forces GCC to use custom shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks. 
It is useful for experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in
Kernel AddressSanitizer.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize-sections=</code><var>s1</var><code>,</code><var>s2</var><code>,...</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_002dsections-1089"></a>Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.  <var>si</var> may
contain wildcards.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize-recover</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>opts</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_002drecover-1090"></a><a name="index-fno_002dsanitize_002drecover-1091"></a><samp><span class="option">-fsanitize-recover=</span></samp> controls error recovery mode for sanitizers
mentioned in comma-separated list of <var>opts</var>.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The <samp><span class="option">-fno-sanitize-recover=</span></samp> option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

     <p>Currently this feature only works for <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp> (and its suboptions
except for <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=unreachable</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=return</span></samp>),
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=bounds-strict</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=kernel-address</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>. 
For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default,
except <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>, for which this feature is experimental. 
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize-recover=all</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-sanitize-recover=all</span></samp> is also
accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that support it,
the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.

     <p>Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also
enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still fatal. 
The runtime library defaults to <code>halt_on_error=0</code> for
ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is <code>halt_on_error=1</code>. This can be overridden through
setting the <code>halt_on_error</code> flag in the corresponding environment variable.

     <p>Syntax without an explicit <var>opts</var> parameter is deprecated.  It is
equivalent to specifying an <var>opts</var> list of:

     <pre class="smallexample">          undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_002daddress_002duse_002dafter_002dscope-1092"></a>Enable sanitization of local variables to detect use-after-scope bugs. 
The option sets <samp><span class="option">-fstack-reuse</span></samp> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_002dundefined_002dtrap_002don_002derror-1093"></a>The <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</span></samp> option instructs the compiler to
report undefined behavior using <code>__builtin_trap</code> rather than
a <code>libubsan</code> library routine.  The advantage of this is that the
<code>libubsan</code> library is not needed and is not linked in, so this
is usable even in freestanding environments.

     <p>Currently there
is only an implementation for Intel MPX available, thus x86 GNU/Linux target
and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> are required to enable this feature. 
MPX-based instrumentation requires
a runtime library to enable MPX in hardware and handle bounds
violation signals.  By default when <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> options are used to link a program, the GCC driver
links against the <samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp> libraries. 
Bounds checking on calls to dynamic libraries requires a linker
with <samp><span class="option">-z bndplt</span></samp> support; if GCC was configured with a linker
without support for this option (including the Gold linker and older
versions of ld), a warning is given if you link with <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp>
without also specifying <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>, since the overall effectiveness
of the bounds checking protection is reduced. 
See also <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpxwrappers</span></samp>.

     <p>MPX-based instrumentation
may be used for debugging and also may be included in production code
to increase program security.  Depending on usage, you may
have different requirements for the runtime library.  The current version
of the MPX runtime library is more oriented for use as a debugging
tool.  MPX runtime library usage implies <samp><span class="option">-lpthread</span></samp>.  See
also <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpx</span></samp>.  The runtime library  behavior can be
influenced using various <samp><span class="env">CHKP_RT_*</span></samp> environment variables.  See
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler</a>
for more details.

     <p>Generated instrumentation may be controlled by various
<samp><span class="option">-fchkp-*</span></samp> options and by the <code>bnd_variable_size</code>
structure field attribute (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>) and
<code>bnd_legacy</code>, and <code>bnd_instrument</code> function attributes
(see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).  GCC also provides a number of built-in

indirect jump) are valid.  This prevents diverting the flow of control
to an unexpected target.  This is intended to protect against such
threats as Return-oriented Programming (ROP), and similarly
call/jmp-oriented programming (COP/JOP).

     <p>The value <code>branch</code> tells the compiler to implement checking of
validity of control-flow transfer at the point of indirect branch
instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value <code>return</code>
implements checking of validity at the point of returning from a
function.  The value <code>full</code> is an alias for specifying both
<code>branch</code> and <code>return</code>. The value <code>none</code> turns off
instrumentation.

     <p>The macro <code>__CET__</code> is defined when <samp><span class="option">-fcf-protection</span></samp> is

when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits. 
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-check</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dcheck-1139"></a>Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

     <p>Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.

     <p>You can additionally specify a string parameter: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo; means no
checking, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">generic</span></samp>&rsquo; means force the use of old-style checking,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">specific</span></samp>&rsquo; means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare <samp><span class="option">-fstack-check</span></samp>.

     <p>Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.  Note this
may change the semantics of some code.

          <li>Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.

          <li>Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
          </ol>

     <p>Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">specific</span></samp>&rsquo; if no target support has been added in the compiler.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fstack-check=</span></samp>&rsquo; is designed for Ada's needs to detect infinite recursion
and stack overflows.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">specific</span></samp>&rsquo; is an excellent choice when compiling
Ada code.  It is not generally sufficient to protect against stack-clash
attacks.  To protect against those you want &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fstack-clash-protection</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-clash-protection</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dclash_002dprotection-1140"></a>Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When this option is
enabled, the compiler will only allocate one page of stack space at a time
and each page is accessed immediately after allocation.  Thus, it prevents
allocations from jumping over any stack guard page provided by the
operating system.

     <p>Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection.  However, on
those targets <samp><span class="option">-fstack-clash-protection</span></samp> will protect dynamic stack
allocations.  <samp><span class="option">-fstack-clash-protection</span></samp> may also provide limited

either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

     <p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x80000000</span></samp>&rsquo;
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<samp><span class="option">-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</span></samp> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.

     <p>You can locally override stack limit checking by using the
<code>no_stack_limit</code> function attribute (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

     <br><dt><code>-fsplit-stack</code><dd><a name="index-fsplit_002dstack-1144"></a>Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows. 
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.

     <p>When code compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span></samp> calls code compiled
without <samp><span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span></samp>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with <samp><span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span></samp> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without <samp><span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span></samp> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.

It turns on (or off, if using <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=none</span></samp>) the security
feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.

     <p>This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup,
which are used for verifying the vtable pointers. 
The options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo;
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches <code>main</code>.  Using
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> causes the data structures to be built after
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized. 
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp> causes them to be built before shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.

     <p>If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different
values specified, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; takes highest priority over both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">preinit</span></samp>&rsquo; takes priority over &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">std</span></samp>&rsquo;.

This flag also causes the compiler to log information about which
vtable pointers it finds for each class. 
This information is written to a file named <samp><span class="file">vtv_set_ptr_data.log</span></samp>
in the directory named by the environment variable <samp><span class="env">VTV_LOGS_DIR</span></samp>
if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.

     <p>Note:  This feature <em>appends</em> data to the log file. If you want a fresh log
file, be sure to delete any existing one.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtv-counts</code><dd><a name="index-fvtv_002dcounts-1147"></a>This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp>, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encounters and the number of verifications it inserts.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions
that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit. 
The compiler writes this information to a file named
<samp><span class="file">vtv_count_data.log</span></samp> in the directory named by the environment
variable <samp><span class="env">VTV_LOGS_DIR</span></samp> if that is defined or the current working

for each class, and writes this information to <samp><span class="file">vtv_class_set_sizes.log</span></samp>
in the same directory.

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions-1148"></a>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<code>__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
          void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
</pre>
     <p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

     <p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <code>extern inline</code> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

     <p>A function may be given the attribute <code>no_instrument_function</code>, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</code><var>file</var><code>,</code><var>file</var><code>,...</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions_002dexclude_002dfile_002dlist-1149"></a>
Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of <samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions</span></samp>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of <var>file</var>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the <var>file</var> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain <samp><span class="file">/bits/stl</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">include/sys</span></samp>.

     <p>If, for some reason, you want to include letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; in one of
<var>sym</var>, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\,</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example,
<samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list='\,\,tmp'</span></samp>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</code><var>sym</var><code>,</code><var>sym</var><code>,...</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions_002dexclude_002dfunction_002dlist-1150"></a>
This is similar to <samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</span></samp>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <code>vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)</code>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <code>_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</code>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <var>sym</var> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.

     <br><dt><code>-fpatchable-function-entry=</code><var>N</var><code>[,</code><var>M</var><code>]</code><dd><a name="index-fpatchable_002dfunction_002dentry-1151"></a>Generate <var>N</var> NOPs right at the beginning
of each function, with the function entry point before the <var>M</var>th NOP. 
If <var>M</var> is omitted, it defaults to <code>0</code> so the
function entry points to the address just at the first NOP. 
The NOP instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in
any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly via
the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the instruction
emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface <code>gen_nop</code>.  This behavior
is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
other compilation options.

     <p>For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas,
which correspond to their respective function entries minus <var>M</var>,
are additionally collected in the <code>__patchable_function_entries</code>
section of the resulting binary.

     <p>Note that the value of <code>__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))</code> takes precedence over command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</span></samp>.  This can be used to increase
the area size or to remove it completely on a single function. 
If <code>N=0</code>, no pad location is recorded.

     <p>The NOP instructions are inserted at&mdash;and maybe before, depending on
<var>M</var>&mdash;the function entry address, even before the prologue.

Some of these options make sense only together with <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> because

line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for <var>file</var> is the preprocessor's working directory <em>instead of</em>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the <code>#include "..."</code> search
chain as normal.

     <p>If multiple <samp><span class="option">-include</span></samp> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.

This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also

You should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking. 
This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,

suitable for <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> describing the dependencies of the main

the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <samp><span class="option">-include</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-imacros</span></samp> command-line options.

     <p>Unless specified explicitly (with <samp><span class="option">-MT</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-MQ</span></samp>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;-newline.  The rule has no
commands.

     <p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<samp><span class="option">-dM</span></samp>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<samp><span class="option">-MF</span></samp>, or use an environment variable like
<samp><span class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</span></samp> (see <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>).  Debug output
is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.

     <p>Passing <samp><span class="option">-M</span></samp> to the driver implies <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, and suppresses

directly or indirectly, from such a header.

     <p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; directive does not in itself determine whether that

the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send
preprocessed output.

     <p>When used with the driver options <samp><span class="option">-MD</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-MMD</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-MF</span></samp> overrides the default dependency output file.

     <p>If <var>file</var> is <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp>, then the dependencies are written to <samp><span class="file">stdout</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-MG</code><dd><a name="index-MG-1165"></a>In conjunction with an option such as <samp><span class="option">-M</span></samp> requesting
dependency generation, <samp><span class="option">-MG</span></samp> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code>#include</code> directive without prepending any path.  <samp><span class="option">-MG</span></samp>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.

     <p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

     <br><dt><code>-MP</code><dd><a name="index-MP-1166"></a>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> to match.

     <p>This is typical output:

     <pre class="smallexample">          test.o: test.c test.h
          
          test.h:
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-MT </code><var>target</var><dd><a name="index-MT-1167"></a>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

     <p>An <samp><span class="option">-MT</span></samp> option sets the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <samp><span class="option">-MT</span></samp>, or use multiple <samp><span class="option">-MT</span></samp> options.

     <p>For example, <samp><span class="option">-MT&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></span></samp> might give

     <pre class="smallexample">          $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-MQ </code><var>target</var><dd><a name="index-MQ-1168"></a>
Same as <samp><span class="option">-MT</span></samp>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <samp><span class="option">-MQ&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></span></samp> gives

     <pre class="smallexample">          $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</pre>
     <p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<samp><span class="option">-MQ</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-MD</code><dd><a name="index-MD-1169"></a><samp><span class="option">-MD</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-M -MF </span><var>file</var></samp>, except that
<samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> is not implied.  The driver determines <var>file</var> based on
whether an <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <samp><span class="file">.d</span></samp>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a <samp><span class="file">.d</span></samp> suffix.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">-MD</span></samp> is used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, any
<samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(see <a href="#dashMF">-MF</a>), but if used without <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, each <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>
is understood to specify a target object file.

     <p>Since <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> is not implied, <samp><span class="option">-MD</span></samp> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation process.

     <br><dt><code>-MMD</code><dd><a name="index-MMD-1170"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-MD</span></samp> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.

     <br><dt><code>-fpreprocessed</code><dd><a name="index-fpreprocessed-1171"></a>Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives. 
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.i</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ii</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.mi</span></samp>&rsquo;.  These are the
extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdirectives-only</code><dd><a name="index-fdirectives_002donly-1172"></a>When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

     <p>The option's behavior depends on the <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp>
options.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as <code>#define</code>, <code>#ifdef</code>, and <code>#error</code>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <samp><span class="option">-dD</span></samp> option is
implicitly enabled.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as <code>__LINE__</code>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>.

     <p>With both <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp>, the rules for
<samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-canonical-system-headers</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dcanonical_002dsystem_002dheaders-1175"></a>When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.

     <br><dt><code>-ftabstop=</code><var>width</var><dd><a name="index-ftabstop-1176"></a>Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.

     <br><dt><code>-ftrack-macro-expansion</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>level</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-ftrack_002dmacro_002dexpansion-1177"></a>Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <var>level</var> parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; of <var>level</var> de-activates
this option. Value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo; tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry. 
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Note that <code>-ftrack-macro-expansion=2</code> is activated by default.

to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> for
<var>new</var> which can result in more reproducible builds that are
location independent.  This option also affects

set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the
locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command-line option.  Currently the command-line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  <var>charset</var> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <code>iconv</code> library routine.

     <br><dt><code>-fpch-deps</code><dd><a name="index-fpch_002ddeps-1185"></a>When using precompiled headers (see <a href="#Precompiled-Headers">Precompiled Headers</a>), this flag
causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only the
precompiled header are listed and not the files that were used to
create it, because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.

     <br><dt><code>-fpch-preprocess</code><dd><a name="index-fpch_002dpreprocess-1186"></a>This option allows use of a precompiled header (see <a href="#Precompiled-Headers">Precompiled Headers</a>) together with <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>.  It inserts a special <code>#pragma</code>,
<code>#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "</code><var>filename</var><code>"</code> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <var>filename</var>. 
When <samp><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span></samp> is in use, GCC recognizes this <code>#pragma</code>
and loads the PCH.

     <p>This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp>.

     <p>You should not write this <code>#pragma</code> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to GCC's
current directory.

     <br><dt><code>-fworking-directory</code><dd><a name="index-fworking_002ddirectory-1187"></a><a name="index-fno_002dworking_002ddirectory-1188"></a>Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC uses this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <samp><span class="option">-fno-working-directory</span></samp>.  If the <samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp> flag is

it does not use shell special characters.

file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.

     <p>You should be prepared for side effects when using <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. 
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-CC</code><dd><a name="index-CC-1191"></a>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

     <p>In addition to the side effects of the <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp> option, the
<samp><span class="option">-CC</span></samp> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-CC</span></samp> option is generally used to support lint comments.

     <p>When used from GCC without <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, this option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>-Wp,</code><var>option</var><dd><a name="index-Wp-1207"></a>You can use <samp><span class="option">-Wp,</span><var>option</var></samp> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <var>option</var> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<var>option</var> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<samp><span class="option">-Wp</span></samp> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <samp><span class="option">-Wp</span></samp> and let the driver handle the
options instead.

     <br><dt><code>-Xpreprocessor </code><var>option</var><dd><a name="index-Xpreprocessor-1208"></a>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to

recognize.

     <p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<samp><span class="option">-Xpreprocessor</span></samp> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.

     <br><dt><code>-no-integrated-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dintegrated_002dcpp-1209"></a>Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation. 
By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing. 
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(<samp><span class="command">cc1</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">cc1plus</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">cc1obj</span></samp> for C, C++,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input. 
This option may be useful in conjunction with the <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-wrapper</span></samp> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.

<h3 class="section">3.14 Options for Linking</h3>

<p><a name="index-link-options-1212"></a><a name="index-options_002c-linking-1213"></a>
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.

     
<a name="index-file-names-1214"></a>
<dl><dt><var>object-file-name</var><dd>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dt><code>-S</code><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-c-1215"></a><a name="index-S-1216"></a><a name="index-E-1217"></a>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See <a href="#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-ld=bfd</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dld_003dbfd-1218"></a>Use the <samp><span class="command">bfd</span></samp> linker instead of the default linker.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-ld=gold</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dld_003dgold-1219"></a>Use the <samp><span class="command">gold</span></samp> linker instead of the default linker.

     <p><a name="index-Libraries-1220"></a><br><dt><code>-l</code><var>library</var><dt><code>-l </code><var>library</var><dd><a name="index-l-1221"></a>Search the library named <var>library</var> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

     <p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.o -lz bar.o</span></samp>&rsquo; searches library &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;
after file <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> but before <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp>.  If <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> refers
to functions in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;, those functions may not be loaded.

     <p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <samp><span class="file">lib</span><var>library</var><span class="file">.a</span></samp>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

     <p>The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp>.

     <p>Normally the files found this way are library files&mdash;archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option and specifying a file name
is that <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> surrounds <var>library</var> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.a</span></samp>&rsquo;
and searches several directories.

     <br><dt><code>-lobjc</code><dd><a name="index-lobjc-1222"></a>You need this special case of the <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

     <br><dt><code>-nostartfiles</code><dd><a name="index-nostartfiles-1223"></a>Do not use the standard system startup files when linking. 
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <samp><span class="option">-nostdlib</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-nolibc</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span></samp> is used.

     <br><dt><code>-nodefaultlibs</code><dd><a name="index-nodefaultlibs-1224"></a>Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. 
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as <samp><span class="option">-static-libgcc</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span></samp>, are ignored. 
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <samp><span class="option">-nostartfiles</span></samp>
is used.

     <p>The compiler may generate calls to <code>memcmp</code>,
<code>memset</code>, <code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code>. 
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-nolibc</code><dd><a name="index-nolibc-1225"></a>Do not use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled with it when
linking.  Still link with the startup files, <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp> or toolchain
provided language support libraries such as <samp><span class="file">libgnat</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">libgfortran</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp> unless options preventing their inclusion are used as
well.  This typically removes <samp><span class="option">-lc</span></samp> from the link command line, as well
as system libraries that normally go with it and become meaningless when
absence of a C library is assumed, for example <samp><span class="option">-lpthread</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-lm</span></samp> in some configurations.  This is intended for bare-board
targets when there is indeed no C library available.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdlib</code><dd><a name="index-nostdlib-1226"></a>Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking. 
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
<samp><span class="option">-static-libgcc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span></samp>, are ignored.

     <p>The compiler may generate calls to <code>memcmp</code>, <code>memset</code>,

<samp><span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span></samp> is <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp>, a library of internal subroutines
which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages. 
(See <a href="gccint.html#Interface">Interfacing to GCC Output</a>,
for more discussion of <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp>.) 
In most cases, you need <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <samp><span class="option">-nostdlib</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span></samp> you should usually specify <samp><span class="option">-lgcc</span></samp> as well. 
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines. 
(An example of such an internal subroutine is <code>__main</code>, used to ensure C++
constructors are called; see <a href="gccint.html#Collect2"><code>collect2</code></a>.)

     <br><dt><code>-pie</code><dd><a name="index-pie-1233"></a>Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable on targets
that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
set of options used for compilation (<samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fPIE</span></samp>,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

     <br><dt><code>-no-pie</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dpie-1234"></a>Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.

     <br><dt><code>-static-pie</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dpie-1235"></a>Produce a static position independent executable on targets that support
it.  A static position independent executable is similar to a static
executable, but can be loaded at any address without a dynamic linker. 
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (<samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fPIE</span></samp>, or model
suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

     <br><dt><code>-pthread</code><dd><a name="index-pthread-1236"></a>Link with the POSIX threads library.  This option is supported on
GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on
x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets this option also sets
flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both
compilation and linking.

     <br><dt><code>-rdynamic</code><dd><a name="index-rdynamic-1237"></a>Pass the flag <samp><span class="option">-export-dynamic</span></samp> to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of <code>dlopen</code> or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.

     <br><dt><code>-s</code><dd><a name="index-s-1238"></a>Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

     <br><dt><code>-static</code><dd><a name="index-static-1239"></a>On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides <samp><span class="option">-pie</span></samp>
and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this
option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>-shared</code><dd><a name="index-shared-1240"></a>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(<samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <br><dt><code>-shared-libgcc</code><dt><code>-static-libgcc</code><dd><a name="index-shared_002dlibgcc-1241"></a><a name="index-static_002dlibgcc-1242"></a>On systems that provide <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively. 
If no shared version of <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.

     <p>There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp>.

     <p>Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds <samp><span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span></samp>
whenever you build a shared library or a main executable, because C++
programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.

     <p>If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp>. 
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option <samp><span class="option">--eh-frame-hdr</span></samp>,
it links the shared version of <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of <samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.

     <p>However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the option
<samp><span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span></samp>, such that it is linked with the shared
<samp><span class="file">libgcc</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libasan</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibasan-1243"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp><span class="option">libasan</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">libasan</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp><span class="file">libasan</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-libasan</span></samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp><span class="file">libasan</span></samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libtsan</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibtsan-1244"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=thread</span></samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp><span class="option">libtsan</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">libtsan</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp><span class="file">libtsan</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-libtsan</span></samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp><span class="file">libtsan</span></samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-liblsan</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dliblsan-1245"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=leak</span></samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp><span class="option">liblsan</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">liblsan</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp><span class="file">liblsan</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-liblsan</span></samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp><span class="file">liblsan</span></samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libubsan</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibubsan-1246"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp><span class="option">libubsan</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">libubsan</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp><span class="file">libubsan</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-libubsan</span></samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp><span class="file">libubsan</span></samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libmpx</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibmpx-1247"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer bounds</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> options are
used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against
<samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp>.  If <samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp> is available as a shared library,
and the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is not used, then this links against
the shared version of <samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpx</span></samp>
option directs the GCC driver to link <samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp> statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libmpxwrappers</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibmpxwrappers-1248"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer bounds</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> options are used
to link a program without also using <samp><span class="option">-fno-chkp-use-wrappers</span></samp>, the
GCC driver automatically links against <samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the
<samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is not used, then this links against the shared
version of <samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpxwrappers</span></samp>
option directs the GCC driver to link <samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp> statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-static-libstdc++</code><dd><a name="index-static_002dlibstdc_002b_002b-1249"></a>When the <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> program is used to link a C++ program, it
normally automatically links against <samp><span class="option">libstdc++</span></samp>.  If
<samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp> is available as a shared library, and the
<samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
<samp><span class="option">-static-libstdc++</span></samp> option directs the <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> driver to
link <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.

     <br><dt><code>-symbolic</code><dd><a name="index-symbolic-1250"></a>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <samp><span class="option">-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</span></samp>).  Only a few systems support
this option.

     <br><dt><code>-T </code><var>script</var><dd><a name="index-T-1251"></a><a name="index-linker-script-1252"></a>Use <var>script</var> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the <samp><span class="option">-T</span></samp> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.

     <br><dt><code>-Xlinker </code><var>option</var><dd><a name="index-Xlinker-1253"></a>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.

     <p>If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
<samp><span class="option">-Xlinker</span></samp> twice, once for the option and once for the argument. 
For example, to pass <samp><span class="option">-assert definitions</span></samp>, you must write
<samp><span class="option">-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</span></samp>.  It does not work to write
<samp><span class="option">-Xlinker "-assert definitions"</span></samp>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

     <p>When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <samp><var>option</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var></samp>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
<samp><span class="option">-Xlinker -Map=output.map</span></samp> rather than
<samp><span class="option">-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</span></samp>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.

     <br><dt><code>-Wl,</code><var>option</var><dd><a name="index-Wl-1254"></a>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  If <var>option</var> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option. 
For example, <samp><span class="option">-Wl,-Map,output.map</span></samp> passes <samp><span class="option">-Map output.map</span></samp> to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
<samp><span class="option">-Wl,-Map=output.map</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-u </code><var>symbol</var><dd><a name="index-u-1255"></a>Pretend the symbol <var>symbol</var> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

     <br><dt><code>-z </code><var>keyword</var><dd><a name="index-z-1256"></a><samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
<var>keyword</var>. See the section in the documentation of your linker for

for header files during preprocessing. 
If <var>dir</var> begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; or <code>$SYSROOT</code>, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
or <code>$SYSROOT</code> is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
<samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-isysroot</span></samp>.

     <p>Directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-iquote</span></samp> apply only to the quote
form of the directive, <code>#include&nbsp;"</code><var>file</var><code>"<!-- /@w --></code>. 
Directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp>,
or <samp><span class="option">-idirafter</span></samp> apply to lookup for both the
<code>#include&nbsp;"</code><var>file</var><code>"<!-- /@w --></code> and
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;<!-- /@w --></code> directives.

     <p>You can specify any number or combination of these options on the
command line to search for header files in several directories. 
The lookup order is as follows:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current
file is searched first.

          <li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified
by <samp><span class="option">-iquote</span></samp> options are searched in left-to-right order,
as they appear on the command line.

          <li>Directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.

          <li>Directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.

          <li>Standard system directories are scanned.

          <li>Directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-idirafter</span></samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.
          </ol>

     <p>You can use <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the standard system header file directories. 
However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files; use <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> for that.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-idirafter</span></samp> options also mark the directory
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that
is applied to the standard system directories.

     <p>If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp>, is also specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain. 
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the <code>#include_next</code> directive are not inadvertently
changed. 
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <samp><span class="option">-nostdinc</span></samp> and/or <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> options.

     <br><dt><code>-I-</code><dd><a name="index-I_002d-1264"></a>Split the include path. 
This option has been deprecated.  Please use <samp><span class="option">-iquote</span></samp> instead for
<samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> directories before the <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp> and remove the <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp>
option.

     <p>Any directories specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>
options before <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp> are searched only for headers requested with
<code>#include&nbsp;"</code><var>file</var><code>"<!-- /@w --></code>; they are not searched for
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;<!-- /@w --></code>.  If additional directories are
specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> options after the <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp>, those
directories are searched for all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; directives.

     <p>In addition, <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp> inhibits the use of the directory of the current
file directory as the first search directory for <code>#include&nbsp;"</code><var>file</var><code>"<!-- /@w --></code>.  There is no way to override this effect of <samp><span class="option">-I-</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-iprefix </code><var>prefix</var><dd><a name="index-iprefix-1265"></a>Specify <var>prefix</var> as the prefix for subsequent <samp><span class="option">-iwithprefix</span></samp>

would; <samp><span class="option">-iwithprefix</span></samp> puts it where <samp><span class="option">-idirafter</span></samp> would.

     <br><dt><code>-isysroot </code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-isysroot-1268"></a>This option is like the <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> option for more
information.

     <br><dt><code>-imultilib </code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-imultilib-1269"></a>Use <var>dir</var> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc-1270"></a>Do not search the standard system directories for header files. 
Only the directories explicitly specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-iquote</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp>, and/or <samp><span class="option">-idirafter</span></samp>
options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate)
are searched.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-1271"></a>Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C++ library.)

     <br><dt><code>-iplugindir=</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-iplugindir_003d-1272"></a>Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by <samp><span class="option">-fplugin=</span><var>name</var></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="option">-fplugin=</span><var>path</var><span class="option">/</span><var>name</var><span class="option">.so</span></samp>.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.

     <br><dt><code>-L</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-L-1273"></a>Add directory <var>dir</var> to the list of directories to be searched
for <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-B</code><var>prefix</var><dd><a name="index-B-1274"></a>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     <p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<samp><span class="command">cpp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">cc1</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>.  It tries
<var>prefix</var> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without &lsquo;<samp><var>machine</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>version</var><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; for the corresponding target
machine and compiler version.

     <p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp>
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes,
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/gcc/</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/gcc/</span></samp>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable.

     <p>The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo; to the prefix.

     <p>The runtime support file <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp> can also be searched for using
the <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     <p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> prefix is to use
the environment variable <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>.  See <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

     <p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> is
<samp><span class="file">[dir/]stage</span><var>N</var><span class="file">/</span></samp>, where <var>N</var> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by <samp><span class="file">[dir/]include</span></samp>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-no-canonical-prefixes</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dcanonical_002dprefixes-1275"></a>Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/../</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/./</span></samp>&rsquo;, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.

     <br><dt><code>--sysroot=</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-sysroot-1276"></a>Use <var>dir</var> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries. 
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp> and libraries in <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp>, it instead
searches <samp><var>dir</var><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp> and <samp><var>dir</var><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp>.

     <p>If you use both this option and the <samp><span class="option">-isysroot</span></samp> option, then
the <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> option applies to libraries, but the
<samp><span class="option">-isysroot</span></samp> option applies to header files.

     <p>The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> still works, but the
library aspect does not.

     <br><dt><code>--no-sysroot-suffix</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dsysroot_002dsuffix-1277"></a>For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp>, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
<samp><var>dir</var><span class="file">/</span><var>suffix</var><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp> instead of
<samp><var>dir</var><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp>.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.

<p><a name="index-code-generation-conventions-1278"></a><a name="index-options_002c-code-generation-1279"></a><a name="index-run_002dtime-options-1280"></a>
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

 <p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <samp><span class="option">-ffoo</span></samp> is <samp><span class="option">-fno-foo</span></samp>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no-</span></samp>&rsquo; or adding
it.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fstack-reuse=</code><var>reuse-level</var><dd><a name="index-fstack_005freuse-1281"></a>This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  <var>reuse_level</var> can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">named_vars</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo; enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">named_vars</span></samp>&rsquo; enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

     <p>For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">             int *p;
             {
               int local1;
          
               p = &amp;local1;
               local1 = 10;
               ....
             }
             {
                int local2;
                local2 = 20;
                ...
             }
          
             if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
               {
          
               }
</pre>
     <p>Another example:
     <pre class="smallexample">          
             struct A
             {
                 A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
                 int i;
                 int j;
             };
          
             A *ap;
          
             void foo(const A&amp; ar)
             {
                ap = &amp;ar;
             }
          
             void bar()
             {
                foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns
          
                {
                  A a(20);
                  ....
                }
                ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                             // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
             }
          
</pre>
     <p>The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.

     <br><dt><code>-ftrapv</code><dd><a name="index-ftrapv-1282"></a>This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations. 
The options <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> override each other, so using
<samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> on the command-line results in
<samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fno-wrapv</span></samp> on the command-line
results in <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> being effective.

     <br><dt><code>-fwrapv</code><dd><a name="index-fwrapv-1283"></a>This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others. 
The options <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> override each other, so using
<samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> on the command-line results in

results in <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> being effective.

     <br><dt><code>-fwrapv-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-fwrapv_002dpointer-1284"></a>This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer arithmetic
overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around using twos-complement
representation.  This flag disables some optimizations which assume
pointer overflow is invalid.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002doverflow-1285"></a>This option implies <samp><span class="option">-fno-wrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fno-wrapv-pointer</span></samp> and when
negated implies <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv-pointer</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fexceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fexceptions-1286"></a>Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC enables it by default for languages like
C++ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't
use exception handling.

     <br><dt><code>-fnon-call-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fnon_002dcall_002dexceptions-1287"></a>Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions. 
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <em>trapping</em>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <code>SIGALRM</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdelete-dead-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fdelete_002ddead_002dexceptions-1288"></a>Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away. 
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification. 
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.

     <br><dt><code>-funwind-tables</code><dd><a name="index-funwind_002dtables-1289"></a>Similar to <samp><span class="option">-fexceptions</span></samp>, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way. 
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.

     <br><dt><code>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</code><dd><a name="index-fasynchronous_002dunwind_002dtables-1290"></a>Generate unwind table in DWARF format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-unique</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dunique-1291"></a>On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++ compiler
uses the <code>STB_GNU_UNIQUE</code> binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of <code>RTLD_LOCAL</code>; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
<code>RTLD_LOCAL</code> plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes <code>dlclose</code> to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via
<code>dlclose</code> and <code>dlopen</code>, you can use
<samp><span class="option">-fno-gnu-unique</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsjlj</code><dd><a name="index-fsjlj-1292"></a>Use setjmp/longjmp exception instead of native exception handling.  The
compiler must have been configured with dual exceptions support for this
option to be available (<samp><span class="option">--enable-dual-exceptions</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>-fpcc-struct-return</code><dd><a name="index-fpcc_002dstruct_002dreturn-1293"></a>Return &ldquo;short&rdquo; <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

     <p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

     <p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<samp><span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span></samp> switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-freg-struct-return</code><dd><a name="index-freg_002dstruct_002dreturn-1294"></a>Return <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in registers when possible. 
This is more efficient for small structures than
<samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>.

     <p>If you specify neither <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp> nor
<samp><span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span></samp>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <samp><span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span></samp>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp> switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fshort-enums</code><dd><a name="index-fshort_002denums-1295"></a>Allocate to an <code>enum</code> type only as many bytes as it needs for the

is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp><span class="option">-fshort-enums</span></samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

useful for building programs to run under WINE.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp><span class="option">-fshort-wchar</span></samp> switch causes GCC to generate

Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-common</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dcommon-1297"></a><a name="index-tentative-definitions-1298"></a>In C code, this option controls the placement of global variables
defined without an initializer, known as <dfn>tentative definitions</dfn>
in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are distinct from declarations
of a variable with the <code>extern</code> keyword, which do not allocate storage.

     <p>Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This allows the
linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable
in different compilation units to the same object, or to a non-tentative
definition. 
This is the behavior specified by <samp><span class="option">-fcommon</span></samp>, and is the default for
GCC on most targets. 
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO
C, and on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
variable references.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-fno-common</span></samp> option specifies that the compiler should instead
place uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file. 
This inhibits the merging of tentative definitions by the linker so
you get a multiple-definition error if the same
variable is defined in more than one compilation unit. 
Compiling with <samp><span class="option">-fno-common</span></samp> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable definitions this way.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-ident</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dident-1299"></a>Ignore the <code>#ident</code> directive.

     <br><dt><code>-finhibit-size-directive</code><dd><a name="index-finhibit_002dsize_002ddirective-1300"></a>Don't output a <code>.size</code> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <samp><span class="file">crtstuff.c</span></samp>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-fverbose-asm</code><dd><a name="index-fverbose_002dasm-1301"></a>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fno-verbose-asm</span></samp>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.

     <p>The added comments include:

          <ul>
<li>information on the compiler version and command-line options,

          <li>the source code lines associated with the assembly instructions,
in the form FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF LINE,

          <li>hints on which high-level expressions correspond to
the various assembly instruction operands.

     </ul>

     <p>For example, given this C source file:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int test (int n)
          {
            int i;
            int total = 0;
          
            for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
              total += i * i;
          
            return total;
          }

     <p>The comments are intended for humans rather than machines and hence the
precise format of the comments is subject to change.

     <br><dt><code>-frecord-gcc-switches</code><dd><a name="index-frecord_002dgcc_002dswitches-1302"></a>This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created. 
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the <samp><span class="option">-fverbose-asm</span></samp> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file. 
See also <samp><span class="option">-grecord-gcc-switches</span></samp> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fpic</code><dd><a name="index-fpic-1303"></a><a name="index-global-offset-table-1304"></a><a name="index-PIC-1305"></a>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> does not work; in that case, recompile with <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC, 28k on AArch64 and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)

     <p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the x86, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

     <p>When this flag is set, the macros <code>__pic__</code> and <code>__PIC__</code>
are defined to 1.

     <br><dt><code>-fPIC</code><dd><a name="index-fPIC-1306"></a>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on AArch64, m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC.

     <p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

     <p>When this flag is set, the macros <code>__pic__</code> and <code>__PIC__</code>
are defined to 2.

     <br><dt><code>-fpie</code><dt><code>-fPIE</code><dd><a name="index-fpie-1307"></a><a name="index-fPIE-1308"></a>These options are similar to <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables. 
Usually these options are used when <samp><span class="option">-pie</span></samp> GCC option is
used during linking.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fPIE</span></samp> both define the macros
<code>__pie__</code> and <code>__PIE__</code>.  The macros have the value 1
for <samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp> and 2 for <samp><span class="option">-fPIE</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-plt</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dplt-1309"></a>Do not use the PLT for external function calls in position-independent code. 
Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the GOT and branch to it. 
This leads to more efficient code by eliminating PLT stubs and exposing
GOT loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32-bit x86 where
PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a specific register, this gives more
register allocation freedom to the compiler. 
Lazy binding requires use of the PLT;
with <samp><span class="option">-fno-plt</span></samp> all external symbols are resolved at load time.

     <p>Alternatively, the function attribute <code>noplt</code> can be used to avoid calls
through the PLT for specific external functions.

     <p>In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-jump-tables</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002djump_002dtables-1310"></a>Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.

     <br><dt><code>-ffixed-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-ffixed-1311"></a>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

     <p><var>reg</var> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>
macro in the machine description macro file.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

     <br><dt><code>-fcall-used-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-fcall_002dused-1312"></a>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as an allocable register that is

     <p>It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a

the register <var>reg</var> if they use it.

     <p>It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.

     <p>A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

     <br><dt><code>-fpack-struct[=</code><var>n</var><code>]</code><dd><a name="index-fpack_002dstruct-1314"></a>Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp><span class="option">-fpack-struct</span></samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fleading-underscore</code><dd><a name="index-fleading_002dunderscore-1315"></a>This option and its counterpart, <samp><span class="option">-fno-leading-underscore</span></samp>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp><span class="option">-fleading-underscore</span></samp> switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface. 
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.

     <br><dt><code>-ftls-model=</code><var>model</var><dd><a name="index-ftls_002dmodel-1316"></a>Alter the thread-local storage model to be used (see <a href="#Thread_002dLocal">Thread-Local</a>). 
The <var>model</var> argument should be one of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global-dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">local-dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">initial-exec</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">local-exec</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may use
a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation
unit, or if <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> is not given on the command line.

     <p>The default without <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">initial-exec</span></samp>&rsquo;; with
<samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> the default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global-dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-ftrampolines</code><dd><a name="index-ftrampolines-1317"></a>For targets that normally need trampolines for nested functions, always
generate them instead of using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that
do not need them, like for example HP-PA or IA-64, do nothing.

     <p>A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the
stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call
the nested function indirectly.  Therefore, it requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fno-trampolines</span></samp> is enabled by default on a language by language
basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if it computes that this
is safe, and replace them with descriptors.  Descriptors are made up of data
only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of this
writing, <samp><span class="option">-fno-trampolines</span></samp> is enabled by default only for Ada.

     <p>Moreover, code compiled with <samp><span class="option">-ftrampolines</span></samp> and code compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-fno-trampolines</span></samp> are not binary compatible if nested functions are
present.  This option must therefore be used on a program-wide basis and be
manipulated with extreme care.

     <br><dt><code>-fvisibility=</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>default</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>internal</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>hidden</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>protected</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-fvisibility-1318"></a>Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option&mdash;all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code. 
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes. 
It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.

     <p>Despite the nomenclature, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default</span></samp>&rsquo; always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">protected</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">internal</span></samp>&rsquo; are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hidden</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The default if <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility</span></samp> isn't specified is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default</span></samp>&rsquo;, i.e., make every symbol public.

     <p>A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by &ldquo;How To Write
Shared Libraries&rdquo; by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</a><!-- /@w -->)&mdash;however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp>
and <code>__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))</code> instead of
<code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.

     <p>For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<code>#pragma GCC visibility</code> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<code>#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)</code> and
<code>#pragma GCC visibility pop</code>. 
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <strong>as
part of the API interface contract</strong> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should <strong>always</strong> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads&mdash;making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code. 
Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, <code>operator new</code> and
<code>operator delete</code> must always be of default visibility.

     <p>Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <code>#pragma GCC visibility push(default)</code>
before including any such headers.

     <p><code>extern</code> declarations are not affected by <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility</span></samp>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span></samp> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <code>extern</code>
functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use <code>__attribute ((visibility))</code> and/or
<code>#pragma GCC visibility</code> to tell the compiler which <code>extern</code>
declarations should be treated as hidden.

     <p>Note that <samp><span class="option">-fvisibility</span></samp> does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type_info</span></samp>&rsquo; nodes are unified between
the DSOs.

     <p>An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002dvolatile_002dbitfields-1319"></a>This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as <code>unsigned short</code> (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.

     <p>If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.

     <p>In some cases, such as when the <code>packed</code> attribute is applied to a
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that
will fault or truncate the result at run time.

     <p>Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.

     <p>The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.

     <br><dt><code>-fsync-libcalls</code><dd><a name="index-fsync_002dlibcalls-1320"></a>This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the <code>__sync</code>
family of functions may be used to implement the C++11 <code>__atomic</code>
family of functions.

     <p>The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is <samp><span class="option">-fno-sync-libcalls</span></samp>.  This option is used in
the implementation of the <samp><span class="file">libatomic</span></samp> runtime library.

This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps
at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as
memory use and execution time; and that print information about GCC's
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should
rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and
linking tasks.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fcallgraph-info</code><dt><code>-fcallgraph-info=</code><var>MARKERS</var><dd><a name="index-fcallgraph_002dinfo-1326"></a>Makes the compiler output callgraph information for the program, on a
per-file basis.  The information is generated in the common VCG format. 
It can be decorated with additional, per-node and/or per-edge information,
if a list of comma-separated markers is additionally specified.  When the
<code>su</code> marker is specified, the callgraph is decorated with stack usage
information; it is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-fstack-usage</span></samp>.  When the <code>da</code>
marker is specified, the callgraph is decorated with information about
dynamically allocated objects.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><var>letters</var><dt><code>-fdump-rtl-</code><var>pass</var><dt><code>-fdump-rtl-</code><var>pass</var><code>=</code><var>filename</var><dd><a name="index-d-1327"></a><a name="index-fdump_002drtl_002d_0040var_007bpass_007d-1328"></a>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<var>letters</var>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the <var>dumpname</var>, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file.  In case of
<samp><span class="option">=</span><var>filename</var></samp> option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files.  Note that the pass number is
assigned as passes are registered into the pass manager.  Most passes
are registered in the order that they will execute and for these passes
the number corresponds to the pass execution order.  However, passes
registered by plugins, passes specific to compilation targets, or
passes that are otherwise registered after all the other passes are
numbered higher than a pass named "final", even if they are executed
earlier.  <var>dumpname</var> is generated from the name of the output

</dl>

     <p>To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass
of interest follow the steps below.

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Invoke GCC with <samp><span class="option">-fdump-passes</span></samp> and in the <samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp> output
look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in. 
For example, the codes <code>tree-evrp</code>, <code>tree-vrp1</code>, and
<code>tree-vrp2</code> correspond to the three Value Range Propagation passes. 
The number at the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass. 
<li>To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to
the <samp><span class="option">-fdump-</span></samp> option prefix and invoke GCC with it.  For example,
to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke
GCC with the <samp><span class="option">-fdump-tree-evrp</span></samp> option.  Optionally, you may
specify the name of the dump file.  If you don't specify one, GCC
creates as described below. 
<li>Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components
separated by a period: the name of the source file GCC was invoked to
compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass number followed by the
letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; for tree passes (and the letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; for RTL passes),
and finally the pass code.  For example, the Early VRP pass dump might
be in a file named <samp><span class="file">myfile.c.038t.evrp</span></samp> in the current working
directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change
from one version of GCC to another.
          </ol>

     <br><dt><code>-fopt-info</code><dt><code>-fopt-info-</code><var>options</var><dt><code>-fopt-info-</code><var>options</var><code>=</code><var>filename</var><dd><a name="index-fopt_002dinfo-1414"></a>Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>options</var></samp>&rsquo; form is used, <var>options</var> is a list of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; separated option keywords to select the dump details and
optimizations.

     <p>The <var>options</var> can be divided into two groups: options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the later options override the earlier options on the command
line.

     <p>The following options control the dump verbosity:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">optimized</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which are
successfully vectorized. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">missed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">note</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print detailed optimization information. This includes
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">optimized</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">missed</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">note</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

     <p>One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a
group of optimizations:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ipa</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">loop</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all loop optimizations. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inline</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">omp</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all OMP (Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vec</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">optall</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of
the optimization groups listed above. 
</dl>

     <p>If <var>options</var> is
omitted, it defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">optimized-optall</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means to dump all
info about successful optimizations from all the passes.

     <p>If the <var>filename</var> is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <var>filename</var>. 
Otherwise the dump is output onto <samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp>. Though multiple
<samp><span class="option">-fopt-info</span></samp> options are accepted, only one of them can include
a <var>filename</var>. If other filenames are provided then all but the
first such option are ignored.

     <p>Note that the output <var>filename</var> is overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, <samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp> should be used
instead.

     <p>In the following example, the optimization info is output to
<samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -O3 -fopt-info
</pre>
     <p>This example:
     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
<samp><span class="file">missed.all</span></samp>, and this one:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">prints information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on <samp><span class="file">stderr</span></samp>. 
Note that <samp><span class="option">-fopt-info-vec-missed</span></samp> is equivalent to
<samp><span class="option">-fopt-info-missed-vec</span></samp>.  The order of the optimization group
names and message types listed after <samp><span class="option">-fopt-info</span></samp> does not matter.

     <p>As another example,
     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
<samp><span class="file">inline.txt</span></samp>.

     <p>Finally, consider:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Here the two output filenames <samp><span class="file">vec.miss</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">loop.opt</span></samp> are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only <samp><span class="file">vec.miss</span></samp> is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

     <br><dt><code>-fsched-verbose=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fsched_002dverbose-1415"></a>On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the

This is a set of options that are used to explicitly disable/enable

internal consistency checking that might affect code generation.

     <br><dt><code>-frandom-seed=</code><var>string</var><dd><a name="index-frandom_002dseed-1420"></a>This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the <samp><span class="option">-frandom-seed</span></samp> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.

     <p>The <var>string</var> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an
arbitrary string (in which case it's converted to a number by
computing CRC32).

     <p>The <var>string</var> should be different for every file you compile.

<samp><span class="file">foo.i</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo.s</span></samp>, as well as <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>.  This creates a
preprocessed <samp><span class="file">foo.i</span></samp> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

     <p>When used in combination with the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> command-line option,
<samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file. 
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp>.

     <p>If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
          gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;
</pre>
     <p>may result in <samp><span class="file">foo.i</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.

time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program. 
Both numbers are in seconds.

     <p>With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the

     <p>The &ldquo;user time&rdquo; and the &ldquo;system time&rdquo; are moved before the program

     <p>The qualifier <code>static</code> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.

     <p>The qualifier <code>dynamic</code> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier <code>bounded</code> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

     <br><dt><code>-fstats</code><dd><a name="index-fstats-1443"></a>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation. 
This option is supported only by the C++ front end, and
the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

     <br><dt><code>-fdbg-cnt-list</code><dd><a name="index-fdbg_002dcnt_002dlist-1444"></a>Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.

     <br><dt><code>-fdbg-cnt=</code><var>counter-value-list</var><dd><a name="index-fdbg_002dcnt-1445"></a>Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  <var>counter-value-list</var>
is a comma-separated list of <var>name</var>:<var>value</var> pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter <var>name</var> to <var>value</var>. 
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of <code>UINT_MAX</code>;
thus <code>dbg_cnt</code> returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option. 
For example, with <samp><span class="option">-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0</span></samp>,
<code>dbg_cnt(dce)</code> returns true only for first 10 invocations.

     <br><dt><code>-print-file-name=</code><var>library</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dfile_002dname-1446"></a>Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that
would be used when linking&mdash;and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-directory</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002ddirectory-1447"></a>Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-lib</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002dlib-1448"></a>Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, and each switch starts with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-os-directory</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002dos_002ddirectory-1449"></a>Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>, if OS libraries are present in <samp><span class="file">lib</span><var>suffix</var></samp>
sibling directories this prints e.g. <samp><span class="file">../lib64</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">../lib</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">../lib32</span></samp>, or if OS libraries are present in <samp><span class="file">lib/</span><var>subdir</var></samp>
subdirectories it prints e.g. <samp><span class="file">amd64</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">sparcv9</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">ev6</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multiarch</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmultiarch-1450"></a>Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory.

     <br><dt><code>-print-prog-name=</code><var>program</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dprog_002dname-1451"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-print-file-name</span></samp>, but searches for a program such as <samp><span class="command">cpp</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-libgcc-file-name</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dlibgcc_002dfile_002dname-1452"></a>Same as <samp><span class="option">-print-file-name=libgcc.a</span></samp>.

     <p>This is useful when you use <samp><span class="option">-nostdlib</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span></samp>
but you do want to link with <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp>.  You can do:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var>... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsearch_002ddirs-1453"></a>Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> searches&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <p>This is useful when <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> prints the error message
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
To resolve this you either need to put <samp><span class="file">cpp0</span></samp> and the other compiler
components where <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp> to the directory where you installed them. 
Don't forget the trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
See <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-sysroot</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsysroot-1454"></a>Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the <samp><span class="option">--sysroot</span></samp> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.

     <br><dt><code>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsysroot_002dheaders_002dsuffix-1455"></a>Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpmachine</code><dd><a name="index-dumpmachine-1456"></a>Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i686-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>&rsquo;)&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpversion</code><dd><a name="index-dumpversion-1457"></a>Print the compiler version (for example, <code>3.0</code>, <code>6.3.0</code> or <code>7</code>)&mdash;and don't do
anything else.  This is the compiler version used in filesystem paths,
specs, can be depending on how the compiler has been configured just
a single number (major version), two numbers separated by dot (major and
minor version) or three numbers separated by dots (major, minor and patchlevel
version).

     <br><dt><code>-dumpfullversion</code><dd><a name="index-dumpfullversion-1458"></a>Print the full compiler version, always 3 numbers separated by dots,
major, minor and patchlevel version.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpspecs</code><dd><a name="index-dumpspecs-1459"></a>Print the compiler's built-in specs&mdash;and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)  See <a href="#Spec-Files">Spec Files</a>.

Each target machine supported by GCC can have its own options&mdash;for
example, to allow you to compile for a particular processor variant or
ABI, or to control optimizations specific to that machine.  By
convention, the names of machine-specific options start with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo;.

 <p>Some configurations of the compiler also support additional target-specific
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.1 AArch64 Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-AArch64-Options-1465"></a>
These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mabi=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mabi-1466"></a>Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values
are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ilp32</span></samp>&rsquo; for SysV-like data model where int, long int and pointers
are 32 bits, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lp64</span></samp>&rsquo; for SysV-like data model where int is 32 bits,
but long int and pointers are 64 bits.

     <p>The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian-1467"></a>Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is configured for an
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aarch64_be-*-*</span></samp>&rsquo; target.

     <br><dt><code>-mgeneral-regs-only</code><dd><a name="index-mgeneral_002dregs_002donly-1468"></a>Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent
the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced SIMD registers but will not
impose any restrictions on the assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian-1469"></a>Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is configured for an
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aarch64-*-*</span></samp>&rsquo; but not an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aarch64_be-*-*</span></samp>&rsquo; target.

     <br><dt><code>-mcmodel=tiny</code><dd><a name="index-mcmodel_003dtiny-1470"></a>Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 1MB of each other.  Programs can be statically or
dynamically linked.

     <br><dt><code>-mcmodel=small</code><dd><a name="index-mcmodel_003dsmall-1471"></a>Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 4GB of each other.  Programs can be statically or
dynamically linked.  This is the default code model.

     <br><dt><code>-mcmodel=large</code><dd><a name="index-mcmodel_003dlarge-1472"></a>Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no assumptions about
addresses and sizes of sections.  Programs can be statically linked only.

     <br><dt><code>-mstrict-align</code><dd><a name="index-mstrict_002dalign-1473"></a>Avoid generating memory accesses that may not be aligned on a natural object
boundary as described in the architecture specification.

     <br><dt><code>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</code><dt><code>-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-momit_002dleaf_002dframe_002dpointer-1474"></a><a name="index-mno_002domit_002dleaf_002dframe_002dpointer-1475"></a>Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former behavior is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>-mtls-dialect=desc</code><dd><a name="index-mtls_002ddialect_003ddesc-1476"></a>Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mtls-dialect=traditional</code><dd><a name="index-mtls_002ddialect_003dtraditional-1477"></a>Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.

     <br><dt><code>-mtls-size=</code><var>size</var><dd><a name="index-mtls_002dsize-1478"></a>Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are 12, 24, 32, 48. 
This option requires binutils 2.26 or newer.

     <br><dt><code>-mfix-cortex-a53-835769</code><dt><code>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</code><dd><a name="index-mfix_002dcortex_002da53_002d835769-1479"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfix_002dcortex_002da53_002d835769-1480"></a>Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769. 
This involves inserting a NOP instruction between memory instructions and
64-bit integer multiply-accumulate instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mfix-cortex-a53-843419</code><dt><code>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</code><dd><a name="index-mfix_002dcortex_002da53_002d843419-1481"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfix_002dcortex_002da53_002d843419-1482"></a>Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53 erratum number 843419. 
This erratum workaround is made at link time and this will only pass the
corresponding flag to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</code><dt><code>-mno-low-precision-recip-sqrt</code><dd><a name="index-mlow_002dprecision_002drecip_002dsqrt-1483"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlow_002dprecision_002drecip_002dsqrt-1484"></a>Enable or disable the reciprocal square root approximation. 
This option only has an effect if <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of reciprocal square root results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.

     <br><dt><code>-mlow-precision-sqrt</code><dt><code>-mno-low-precision-sqrt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_002dmlow_002dprecision_002dsqrt-1485"></a><a name="index-g_t_002dmno_002dlow_002dprecision_002dsqrt-1486"></a>Enable or disable the square root approximation. 
This option only has an effect if <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of square root results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision. 
If enabled, it implies <samp><span class="option">-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlow-precision-div</code><dt><code>-mno-low-precision-div</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_002dmlow_002dprecision_002ddiv-1487"></a><a name="index-g_t_002dmno_002dlow_002dprecision_002ddiv-1488"></a>Enable or disable the division approximation. 
This option only has an effect if <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of division results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.

     <br><dt><code>-march=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-march-1489"></a>Specify the name of the target architecture and, optionally, one or
more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
<samp><span class="option">-march=</span><var>arch</var><span class="option">{+[no]</span><var>feature</var><span class="option">}*</span></samp>.

     <p>The permissible values for <var>arch</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.1-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.2-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.3-a</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.4-a</span></samp>&rsquo;
or <var>native</var>.

     <p>The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.4-a</span></samp>&rsquo; implies &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.3-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.4-A architecture extensions.

     <p>The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.3-a</span></samp>&rsquo; implies &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.2-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.3-A architecture extensions.

     <p>The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.2-a</span></samp>&rsquo; implies &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.1-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.2-A architecture extensions.

     <p>The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.1-a</span></samp>&rsquo; implies &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.1-A architecture extension.  In particular, it
enables the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+crc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+lse</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+rdma</span></samp>&rsquo; features.

     <p>The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; is available on native AArch64 GNU/Linux and
causes the compiler to pick the architecture of the host system.  This
option has no effect if the compiler is unable to recognize the
architecture of the host system,

     <p>The permissible values for <var>feature</var> are listed in the sub-section
on <a href="#aarch64_002dfeature_002dmodifiers"><samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> Feature Modifiers</a>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
specified, the right-most feature is used.

     <p>GCC uses <var>name</var> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
when generating assembly code.  If <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> is specified
without either of <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> also being
specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range of target
processors implementing the target architecture.

     <br><dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-1490"></a>Specify the name of the target processor for which GCC should tune the
performance of the code.  Permissible values for this option are:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">generic</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cortex-a35</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cortex-a53</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cortex-a55</span></samp>&rsquo;,

     <p>Additionally on native AArch64 GNU/Linux systems the value
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; tunes performance to the host system.  This option has no effect
if the compiler is unable to recognize the processor of the host system.

     <p>Where none of <samp><span class="option">-mtune=</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-march=</span></samp>
are specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range
of target processors.

     <p>This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-1491"></a>Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by one
or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu</var><span class="option">{+[no]</span><var>feature</var><span class="option">}*</span></samp>, where
the permissible values for <var>cpu</var> are the same as those available

<a href="#aarch64_002dfeature_002dmodifiers"><samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> Feature Modifiers</a>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
specified, the right-most feature is used.

     <p>GCC uses <var>name</var> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code (as if by <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>) and to determine
the target processor for which to tune for performance (as if
by <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>).  Where this option is used in conjunction
with <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>, those options take precedence
over the appropriate part of this option.

     <br><dt><code>-moverride=</code><var>string</var><dd><a name="index-moverride-1492"></a>Override tuning decisions made by the back-end in response to a

for <var>string</var> in this option are not guaranteed to be consistent
across releases.

     <p>This option is only intended to be useful when developing GCC.

     <br><dt><code>-mverbose-cost-dump</code><dd><a name="index-mverbose_002dcost_002ddump-1493"></a>Enable verbose cost model dumping in the debug dump files.  This option is
provided for use in debugging the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-mpc-relative-literal-loads</code><dt><code>-mno-pc-relative-literal-loads</code><dd><a name="index-mpc_002drelative_002dliteral_002dloads-1494"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpc_002drelative_002dliteral_002dloads-1495"></a>Enable or disable PC-relative literal loads.  With this option literal pools are
accessed using a single instruction and emitted after each function.  This
limits the maximum size of functions to 1MB.  This is enabled by default for
<samp><span class="option">-mcmodel=tiny</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-msign-return-address=</code><var>scope</var><dd><a name="index-msign_002dreturn_002daddress-1496"></a>Select the function scope on which return address signing will be applied. 
Permissible values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;, which disables return address signing,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">non-leaf</span></samp>&rsquo;, which enables pointer signing for functions which are not leaf
functions, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;, which enables pointer signing for all functions.  The
default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-msve-vector-bits=</code><var>bits</var><dd><a name="index-msve_002dvector_002dbits-1497"></a>Specify the number of bits in an SVE vector register.  This option only has
an effect when SVE is enabled.

     <p>GCC supports two forms of SVE code generation: &ldquo;vector-length
agnostic&rdquo; output that works with any size of vector register and
&ldquo;vector-length specific&rdquo; output that allows GCC to make assumptions
about the vector length when it is useful for optimization reasons. 
The possible values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bits</span></samp>&rsquo; are: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scalable</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">128</span></samp>&rsquo;,

Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scalable</span></samp>&rsquo; selects vector-length agnostic
output.  At present &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-msve-vector-bits=128</span></samp>&rsquo; also generates vector-length
agnostic output.  All other values generate vector-length specific code. 
The behavior of these values may change in future releases and no value except
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scalable</span></samp>&rsquo; should be relied on for producing code that is portable across
different hardware SVE vector lengths.

     <p>The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-msve-vector-bits=scalable</span></samp>&rsquo;, which produces
vector-length agnostic code.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.2 Adapteva Epiphany Options</h4>

<p>These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mhalf-reg-file</code><dd><a name="index-mhalf_002dreg_002dfile-1500"></a>Don't allocate any register in the range <code>r32</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>r63</code>. 
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mprefer-short-insn-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mprefer_002dshort_002dinsn_002dregs-1501"></a>Preferentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation. 
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.

     <br><dt><code>-mbranch-cost=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mbranch_002dcost-1502"></a>Set the cost of branches to roughly <var>num</var> &ldquo;simple&rdquo; instructions. 
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.

     <br><dt><code>-mcmove</code><dd><a name="index-mcmove-1503"></a>Enable the generation of conditional moves.

     <br><dt><code>-mnops=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mnops-1504"></a>Emit <var>num</var> NOPs before every other generated instruction.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-soft-cmpsf</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsoft_002dcmpsf-1505"></a>For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an <code>fsub</code> instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero. 
The default is <samp><span class="option">-msoft-cmpsf</span></samp>, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.

     <br><dt><code>-mstack-offset=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mstack_002doffset-1506"></a>Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer. 
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range <code>sp+0...sp+7</code>
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation. 
Values other than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">16</span></samp>&rsquo; are untested and unlikely to work. 
Note also that this option changes the ABI; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work. 
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate <samp><span class="option">--with-stack-offset=</span><var>num</var></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-round-nearest</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dround_002dnearest-1507"></a>Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is <samp><span class="option">-mround-nearest</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002dcalls-1508"></a>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the <code>b</code> / <code>bl</code> instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call. 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mshort-calls</code><dd><a name="index-short_002dcalls-1509"></a>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the <code>b</code> / <code>bl</code> instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is <samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall16</code><dd><a name="index-msmall16-1510"></a>Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which <samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp> semantics
are in effect.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-mode=</code><var>mode</var><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dmode-1511"></a>Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit. 
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.

     <p><var>mode</var> can be set to one the following values:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caller</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions. 
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing FPU modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">truncate</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">round-nearest</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g. 
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate. 
</dl>

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-mfp-mode=caller</span></samp>

     <br><dt><code>-mnosplit-lohi</code><dt><code>-mno-postinc</code><dt><code>-mno-postmodify</code><dd><a name="index-mnosplit_002dlohi-1512"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpostinc-1513"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpostmodify-1514"></a>Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit
loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and generation of
post-modify addresses.  The defaults are <samp><span class="option">msplit-lohi</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-mpost-inc</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-mpost-modify</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mnovect-double</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dvect_002ddouble-1515"></a>Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mvect-double</span></samp>, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.

     <br><dt><code>-max-vect-align=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-max_002dvect_002dalign-1516"></a>The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types. 
<var>num</var> may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8. 
Note that this is an ABI change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use SIMD vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.

     <br><dt><code>-msplit-vecmove-early</code><dd><a name="index-msplit_002dvecmove_002dearly-1517"></a>Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.

     <br><dt><code>-m1reg-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-m1reg_002d-1518"></a>Specify a register to hold the constant &minus;1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster. 
Allowable values for <var>reg</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r43</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r63</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means that no register is used for this
purpose.  The default is <samp><span class="option">-m1reg-none</span></samp>.

execution instructions.

     <p>Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand numbers,
literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for conditional execution,
the target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking,
so the ARC port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
conditional execution generation opportunities after register allocation,
branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass
generally, but not always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of
extra compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off. 
If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.4 ARM Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-ARM-options-1612"></a>
These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for the ARM port:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mabi=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mabi-1613"></a>Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">apcs-gnu</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atpcs</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aapcs</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aapcs-linux</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iwmmxt</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mapcs-frame</code><dd><a name="index-mapcs_002dframe-1614"></a>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying <samp><span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span></samp>
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-apcs-frame</span></samp>. 
This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-mapcs</code><dd><a name="index-mapcs-1615"></a>This is a synonym for <samp><span class="option">-mapcs-frame</span></samp> and is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-mthumb-interwork</code><dd><a name="index-mthumb_002dinterwork-1616"></a>Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-thumb-interwork</span></samp>, since slightly larger code
is generated when <samp><span class="option">-mthumb-interwork</span></samp> is specified.  In AAPCS
configurations this option is meaningless.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-sched-prolog</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsched_002dprolog-1617"></a>Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <samp><span class="option">-msched-prolog</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mfloat-abi=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mfloat_002dabi-1618"></a>Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values
are: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">softfp</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hard</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft</span></samp>&rsquo; causes GCC to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">softfp</span></samp>&rsquo; allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hard</span></samp>&rsquo; allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.

     <p>The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
compatible set of libraries.

     <br><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian-1619"></a>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian-1620"></a>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.

     <br><dt><code>-mbe8</code><dt><code>-mbe32</code><dd><a name="index-mbe8-1621"></a>When linking a big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32 formats. 
The option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored.  The
default is dependent on the selected target architecture.  For ARMv6
and later architectures the default is BE8, for older architectures
the default is BE32.  BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.

     <br><dt><code>-march=</code><var>name</var><span class="roman">[</span><code>+extension...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-march-1622"></a>This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span></samp> option.

     <p>Permissible names are:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv4t</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv5t</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv5te</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6j</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6k</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6kz</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6t2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6z</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6zk</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7ve</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.1-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.2-a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.3-a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8.4-a</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7-r</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-r</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6-m</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv6s-m</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7-m</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7e-m</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-m.base</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-m.main</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iwmmxt</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iwmmxt2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support for the
Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is deprecated:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv2a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv3m</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv4</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv5</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv5e</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Many of the architectures support extensions.  These can be added by
appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span><var>extension</var></samp>&rsquo; to the architecture name.  Extension
options are processed in order and capabilities accumulate.  An extension
will also enable any necessary base extensions
upon which it depends.  For example, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+crypto</span></samp>&rsquo; extension
will always enable the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+simd</span></samp>&rsquo; extension.  The exception to the
additive construction is for extensions that are prefixed with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+no...</span></samp>&rsquo;: these extensions disable the specified option and
any other extensions that may depend on the presence of that
extension.

     <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
writing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=armv7-a+vfpv4</span></samp>&rsquo; since the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+simd</span></samp>&rsquo; option is
entirely disabled by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+nofp</span></samp>&rsquo; option that follows it.

     <p>Most extension names are generically named, but have an effect that is
dependent upon the architecture to which it is applied.  For example,
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+simd</span></samp>&rsquo; option can be applied to both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-a</span></samp>&rsquo; architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7-A
Advanced SIMD (Neon) extensions for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv7-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and the ARMv8-A
variant for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">armv8-a</span></samp>&rsquo;.

Architectures not mentioned do not support any extensions.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mtune=generic-</span><var>arch</var></samp> specifies that GCC should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture <var>arch</var>. 
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the
range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
this option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models come and go.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> permits the same extension options as <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp>, but
the extension options do not affect the tuning of the generated code.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mtune=native</span></samp> causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect is
unsuccessful the option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>name</var><span class="roman">[</span><code>+extension...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-mcpu-1624"></a>This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name
to derive the name of the target ARM architecture (as if specified
by <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>) and the ARM processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

     <p>Many of the supported CPUs implement optional architectural
extensions.  Where this is so the architectural extensions are
normally enabled by default.  If implementations that lack the
extension exist, then the extension syntax can be used to disable
those extensions that have been omitted.  For floating-point and
Advanced SIMD (Neon) instructions, the settings of the options
<samp><span class="option">-mfloat-abi</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mfpu</span></samp> must also be considered:
floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions will only be used if
<samp><span class="option">-mfloat-abi</span></samp> is not set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft</span></samp>&rsquo;; and any setting of
<samp><span class="option">-mfpu</span></samp> other than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; will override the available
floating-point and SIMD extension instructions.

     <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cortex-a9</span></samp>&rsquo; can be found in three major
configurations: integer only, with just a floating-point unit or with
floating-point and Advanced SIMD.  The default is to enable all the
instructions, but the extensions &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+nosimd</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+nofp</span></samp>&rsquo; can
be used to disable just the SIMD or both the SIMD and floating-point
instructions respectively.

     <p>Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
<samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>.

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfpv3-fp16</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfpv3-d16</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfpv3-d16-fp16</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfpv3xd</span></samp>&rsquo;,

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fpv5-d16</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fpv5-sp-d16</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fp-armv8</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">neon-fp-armv8</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">crypto-neon-fp-armv8</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">neon</span></samp>&rsquo; is an alias for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">neon-vfpv3</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfp</span></samp>&rsquo;
is an alias for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfpv2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>The setting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; is the default and is special.  It causes the
compiler to select the floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions
based on the settings of <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>.

     <p>If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension
(e.g. <samp><span class="option">-mfpu=neon</span></samp>), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is also specified.  This is
because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.

     <p>You can also set the fpu name at function level by using the <code>target("fpu=")</code> function attributes (see <a href="#ARM-Function-Attributes">ARM Function Attributes</a>) or pragmas (see <a href="#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas">Function Specific Option Pragmas</a>).

     <br><dt><code>-mfp16-format=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mfp16_002dformat-1626"></a>Specify the format of the <code>__fp16</code> half-precision floating-point type. 
Permissible names are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ieee</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alternative</span></samp>&rsquo;;
the default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;, in which case the <code>__fp16</code> type is not
defined.  See <a href="#Half_002dPrecision">Half-Precision</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-mstructure-size-boundary=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-mstructure_002dsize_002dboundary-1627"></a>The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying ABI supports it.

     <p>Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-mabort-on-noreturn</code><dd><a name="index-mabort_002don_002dnoreturn-1628"></a>Generate a call to the function <code>abort</code> at the end of a
<code>noreturn</code> function.  It is executed if the function tries to
return.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code><dt><code>-mno-long-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002dcalls-1629"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlong_002dcalls-1630"></a>Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.

     <p>Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the <code>short_call</code> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a <code>#pragma no_long_calls</code> directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the <code>long_call</code>
attribute or the <code>section</code> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a <code>#pragma long_calls</code> directive are always
turned into long calls.

     <p>This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<samp><span class="option">-mno-long-calls</span></samp> restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a <code>#pragma
long_calls_off</code> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.

     <br><dt><code>-msingle-pic-base</code><dd><a name="index-msingle_002dpic_002dbase-1631"></a>Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.

     <br><dt><code>-mpic-register=</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-mpic_002dregister-1632"></a>Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing. 
For standard PIC base case, the default is any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single PIC base case, the default is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R9</span></samp>&rsquo; if target is EABI based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R10</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</code><dd><a name="index-mpic_002ddata_002dis_002dtext_002drelative-1633"></a>Assume that the displacement between the text and data segments is fixed
at static link time.  This permits using PC-relative addressing
operations to access data known to be in the data segment.  For
non-VxWorks RTP targets, this option is enabled by default.  When
disabled on such targets, it will enable <samp><span class="option">-msingle-pic-base</span></samp> by
default.

     <br><dt><code>-mpoke-function-name</code><dd><a name="index-mpoke_002dfunction_002dname-1634"></a>Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:

     <pre class="smallexample">               t0
                   .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                   .align
               t1
                   .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
               arm_poke_function_name
                   mov     ip, sp
                   stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                   sub     fp, ip, #4
</pre>
     <p>When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
<code>pc</code> stored at <code>fp + 0</code>.  If the trace function then looks at
location <code>pc - 12</code> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length <code>((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mthumb</code><dt><code>-marm</code><dd><a name="index-marm-1635"></a><a name="index-mthumb-1636"></a>
Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb
states.  The default for most configurations is to generate code
that executes in ARM state, but the default can be changed by
configuring GCC with the <samp><span class="option">--with-mode=</span></samp><var>state</var>
configure option.

     <p>You can also override the ARM and Thumb mode for each function
by using the <code>target("thumb")</code> and <code>target("arm")</code> function attributes
(see <a href="#ARM-Function-Attributes">ARM Function Attributes</a>) or pragmas (see <a href="#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas">Function Specific Option Pragmas</a>).

     <br><dt><code>-mflip-thumb</code><dd><a name="index-mflip_002dthumb-1637"></a>Switch ARM/Thumb modes on alternating functions. 
This option is provided for regression testing of mixed Thumb/ARM code
generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.

     <br><dt><code>-mtpcs-frame</code><dd><a name="index-mtpcs_002dframe-1638"></a>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-tpcs-frame</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</code><dd><a name="index-mtpcs_002dleaf_002dframe-1639"></a>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcallee-super-interworking</code><dd><a name="index-mcallee_002dsuper_002dinterworking-1640"></a>Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mcaller-super-interworking</code><dd><a name="index-mcaller_002dsuper_002dinterworking-1641"></a>Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mtp=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mtp-1642"></a>Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft</span></samp>&rsquo;, which generates calls to <code>__aeabi_read_tp</code>,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cp15</span></samp>&rsquo;, which fetches the thread pointer from <code>cp15</code> directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo;, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mtls-dialect=</code><var>dialect</var><dd><a name="index-mtls_002ddialect-1643"></a>Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
<var>dialect</var>s are supported&mdash;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu</span></samp>&rsquo; dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic TLS models.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu2</span></samp>&rsquo; dialect
selects the GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec TLS models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.

     <br><dt><code>-mword-relocations</code><dd><a name="index-mword_002drelocations-1644"></a>Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32). 
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>
is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd</code><dd><a name="index-mfix_002dcortex_002dm3_002dldrd-1645"></a>Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when <code>ldrd</code> instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids
generating these instructions.  This option is enabled by default when
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=cortex-m3</span></samp> is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-munaligned-access</code><dt><code>-mno-unaligned-access</code><dd><a name="index-munaligned_002daccess-1646"></a><a name="index-mno_002dunaligned_002daccess-1647"></a>Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit values
from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.  By default
unaligned access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M and for
ARMv8-M Baseline architectures, and enabled for all other
architectures.  If unaligned access is not enabled then words in packed
data structures are accessed a byte at a time.

     <p>The ARM attribute <code>Tag_CPU_unaligned_access</code> is set in the
generated object file to either true or false, depending upon the
setting of this option.  If unaligned access is enabled then the
preprocessor symbol <code>__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED</code> is also
defined.

     <br><dt><code>-mneon-for-64bits</code><dd><a name="index-mneon_002dfor_002d64bits-1648"></a>Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This is
disabled by default since the cost of moving data from core registers
to Neon is high.

     <br><dt><code>-mslow-flash-data</code><dd><a name="index-mslow_002dflash_002ddata-1649"></a>Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction. 
Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance. 
This option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and
off by default.

     <br><dt><code>-masm-syntax-unified</code><dd><a name="index-masm_002dsyntax_002dunified-1650"></a>Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax.  The default is
currently off which implies divided syntax.  This option has no impact
on Thumb2. However, this may change in future releases of GCC. 
Divided syntax should be considered deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-mrestrict-it</code><dd><a name="index-mrestrict_002dit-1651"></a>Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of ARMv8-A. 
IT blocks can only contain a single 16-bit instruction from a select
set of instructions. This option is on by default for ARMv8-A Thumb mode.

     <br><dt><code>-mprint-tune-info</code><dd><a name="index-mprint_002dtune_002dinfo-1652"></a>Print CPU tuning information as comment in assembler file.  This is
an option used only for regression testing of the compiler and not
intended for ordinary use in compiling code.  This option is disabled
by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mverbose-cost-dump</code><dd><a name="index-mverbose_002dcost_002ddump-1653"></a>Enable verbose cost model dumping in the debug dump files.  This option is
provided for use in debugging the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-mpure-code</code><dd><a name="index-mpure_002dcode-1654"></a>Do not allow constant data to be placed in code sections. 
Additionally, when compiling for ELF object format give all text sections the
ELF processor-specific section attribute <code>SHF_ARM_PURECODE</code>.  This option
is only available when generating non-pic code for M-profile targets with the
MOVT instruction.

     <br><dt><code>-mcmse</code><dd><a name="index-mcmse-1655"></a>Generate secure code as per the "ARMv8-M Security Extensions: Requirements on
Development Tools Engineering Specification", which can be found on
<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ecm0359818/ECM0359818_armv8m_security_extensions_reqs_on_dev_tools_1_0.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ecm0359818/ECM0359818_armv8m_security_extensions_reqs_on_dev_tools_1_0.pdf</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.18.5.1 <code>EIND</code> and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bEIND_007d-1677"></a>Pointers in the implementation are 16&nbsp;bits wide. 
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64&nbsp;Ki words.

 <p>In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128&nbsp;Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
<code>EIND</code> that serves as most significant part of the target address
when <code>EICALL</code> or <code>EIJMP</code> instructions are used.

 <p>Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:

     <ul>
<li>The compiler never sets <code>EIND</code>.

     <li>The compiler uses <code>EIND</code> implicitly in <code>EICALL</code>/<code>EIJMP</code>
instructions or might read <code>EIND</code> directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a <code>RET</code> instruction.

     <li>The compiler assumes that <code>EIND</code> never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, <code>EIND</code> is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.

     <li>For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates <em>stubs</em>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
<em>trampolines</em>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub. 
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.

     <li>Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates
the stubs correctly in all situations. See the compiler option
<samp><span class="option">-mrelax</span></samp> and the linker option <samp><span class="option">--relax</span></samp>. 
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.

     <li>The default linker script is arranged for code with <code>EIND = 0</code>. 
If code is supposed to work for a setup with <code>EIND != 0</code>, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with <code>.trampolines</code> into the segment where <code>EIND</code>
points to.

     <li>The startup code from libgcc never sets <code>EIND</code>. 
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. 
For the impact of AVR-LibC on <code>EIND</code>, see the
<a href="http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/">AVR-LibC&nbsp;user&nbsp;manual</a><!-- /@w -->.

     <li>It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up <code>EIND</code>
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section <code>.init3</code>. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets <code>EIND</code> to the segment
where the vector table is located.
     <pre class="example">          #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
          
          static void
          __attribute__((section(".init3"),naked,used,no_instrument_function))
          init3_set_eind (void)
          {
            __asm volatile ("ldi r24,pm_hh8(__trampolines_start)\n\t"
                            "out %i0,r24" :: "n" (&amp;EIND) : "r24","memory");
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The <code>__trampolines_start</code> symbol is defined in the linker script.

     <li>Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if
the following two conditions are met:
          <ul>
<li>The address of a label is taken by means of the <code>gs</code> modifier
(short for <em>generate stubs</em>) like so:
          <pre class="example">               LDI r24, lo8(gs(<var>func</var>))
               LDI r25, hi8(gs(<var>func</var>))
</pre>
          <li>The final location of that label is in a code segment
<em>outside</em> the segment where the stubs are located. 
</ul>

     <li>The compiler emits such <code>gs</code> modifiers for code labels in the
following situations:
          <ul>
<li>Taking address of a function or code label. 
<li>Computed goto. 
<li>If prologue-save function is used, see <samp><span class="option">-mcall-prologues</span></samp>
command-line option. 
<li>Switch/case dispatch tables. If you do not want such dispatch
tables you can specify the <samp><span class="option">-fno-jump-tables</span></samp> command-line option. 
<li>C and C++ constructors/destructors called during startup/shutdown. 
<li>If the tools hit a <code>gs()</code> modifier explained above. 
</ul>

     <li>Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is <em>not</em> supported:

     <pre class="example">          int main (void)
          {
              /* Call function at word address 0x2 */
              return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();
          }
</pre>
     <p>Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be called
through a symbol (<code>func_4</code> in the example):

     <pre class="example">          int main (void)
          {
              extern int func_4 (void);
          
              /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */
              return func_4();
          }
</pre>
     <p>and the application be linked with <samp><span class="option">-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4</span></samp>. 
Alternatively, <code>func_4</code> can be defined in the linker script. 
</ul>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bRAMPD_007d-1678"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bRAMPX_007d-1679"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bRAMPY_007d-1680"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bRAMPZ_007d-1681"></a>Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64&nbsp;KiB range
that can be accessed with 16-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64&nbsp;KiB range, the content of a <code>RAMP</code>
register is used as high part of the address:
The <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Z</code> address register is concatenated
with the <code>RAMPX</code>, <code>RAMPY</code>, <code>RAMPZ</code> special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
<code>RAMPD</code> is used together with direct addressing.

     <ul>
<li>The startup code initializes the <code>RAMP</code> special function
registers with zero.

     <li>If a <a href="#AVR-Named-Address-Spaces">named address space</a> other than
generic or <code>__flash</code> is used, then <code>RAMPZ</code> is set
as needed before the operation.

     <li>If the device supports RAM larger than 64&nbsp;KiB and the compiler
needs to change <code>RAMPZ</code> to accomplish an operation, <code>RAMPZ</code>
is reset to zero after the operation.

     <li>If the device comes with a specific <code>RAMP</code> register, the ISR
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it with
zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.

     <li>RAM larger than 64&nbsp;KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR targets. 
If you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the
16-bit address range and change one of the <code>RAMP</code> registers,
you must reset it to zero after the access.

 </ul>

avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mspecld-anomaly</code><dd><a name="index-mspecld_002danomaly-1686"></a>When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not

This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mleaf-id-shared-library</code><dd><a name="index-mleaf_002did_002dshared_002dlibrary-1695"></a>Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method,
but assumes that this library or executable won't link against any other
ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps
and calls.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dleaf_002did_002dshared_002dlibrary-1696"></a>Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any ID shared
libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump and call insns.

     <br><dt><code>-mshared-library-id=n</code><dd><a name="index-mshared_002dlibrary_002did-1697"></a>Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

     <br><dt><code>-msep-data</code><dd><a name="index-msep_002ddata-1698"></a>Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-sep-data</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsep_002ddata-1699"></a>Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.

address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.

     <p>This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<samp><span class="option">-mno-long-calls</span></samp> restores the default behavior.  Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.

     <br><dt><code>-mfast-fp</code><dd><a name="index-mfast_002dfp-1702"></a>Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes some of
the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for checking inputs against
Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.

     <br><dt><code>-minline-plt</code><dd><a name="index-minline_002dplt-1703"></a>Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without <samp><span class="option">-mfdpic</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mmulticore</code><dd><a name="index-mmulticore-1704"></a>Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors. 
This option causes proper start files and link scripts supporting
multicore to be used, and defines the macro <code>__BFIN_MULTICORE</code>. 
It can only be used with <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=bf561[-</span><var>sirevision</var><span class="option">]</span></samp>.

     <p>This option can be used with <samp><span class="option">-mcorea</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcoreb</span></samp>, which
selects the one-application-per-core programming model.  Without
<samp><span class="option">-mcorea</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcoreb</span></samp>, the single-application/dual-core
programming model is used. In this model, the main function of Core B
should be named as <code>coreb_main</code>.

     <p>If this option is not used, the single-core application programming
model is used.

     <br><dt><code>-mcorea</code><dd><a name="index-mcorea-1705"></a>Build a standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core A, and the macro
<code>__BFIN_COREA</code> is defined. 
This option can only be used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-mmulticore</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcoreb</code><dd><a name="index-mcoreb-1706"></a>Build a standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core B, and the macro
<code>__BFIN_COREB</code> is defined. When this option is used, <code>coreb_main</code>
should be used instead of <code>main</code>. 
This option can only be used in conjunction with <samp><span class="option">-mmulticore</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-msdram</code><dd><a name="index-msdram-1707"></a>Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files and
link scripts are used to put the application into SDRAM, and the macro
<code>__BFIN_SDRAM</code> is defined. 
The loader should initialize SDRAM before loading the application.

     <br><dt><code>-micplb</code><dd><a name="index-micplb-1708"></a>Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an effect on certain
anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets, the default is to assume ICPLBs
are enabled; for standalone applications the default is off.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.10 Darwin Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-Darwin-options-1754"></a>
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.

 <p>FSF GCC on Darwin does not create &ldquo;fat&rdquo; object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to
target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create &ldquo;fat&rdquo; files if multiple
<samp><span class="option">-arch</span></samp> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
<samp><span class="file">lipo</span></samp>.

 <p>The subtype of the file created (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc7400</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc970</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i686</span></samp>&rsquo;) is determined by the flags that specify the ISA
that GCC is targeting, like <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>.  The
<samp><span class="option">-force_cpusubtype_ALL</span></samp> option can be used to override this.

 <p>The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch.  The assembler, <samp><span class="file">as</span></samp>, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc750</span></samp>&rsquo; object file. 
The linker for shared libraries, <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/libtool</span></samp>, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc970</span></samp>&rsquo; object file in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc7400</span></samp>&rsquo; library).  The linker
for executables, <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-F</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-F-1755"></a>Add the framework directory <var>dir</var> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.

     <p>A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a <samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> and/or
<samp><span class="file">PrivateHeaders</span></samp> directory contained directly in it that ends
in <samp><span class="file">.framework</span></samp>.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the <samp><span class="file">.framework</span></samp>.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
<samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's <samp><span class="file">Frameworks</span></samp> directory. 
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in <samp><span class="file">/System/Library/Frameworks</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/Library/Frameworks</span></samp>.  An example include looks like
<code>#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;</code>, where <samp><span class="file">Framework</span></samp> denotes
the name of the framework and <samp><span class="file">header.h</span></samp> is found in the
<samp><span class="file">PrivateHeaders</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> directory.

     <br><dt><code>-iframework</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-iframework-1756"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-F</span></samp> except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this <samp><span class="option">-iframework</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-F</span></samp> is that with <samp><span class="option">-iframework</span></samp> the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
<var>dir</var>.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.

     <br><dt><code>-gused</code><dd><a name="index-gused-1757"></a>Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables <samp><span class="option">-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</span></samp>. 
This is by default ON.

is <var>version</var>.  Typical values of <var>version</var> include <code>10.1</code>,
<code>10.2</code>, and <code>10.3.9</code>.

     <p>If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.

     <br><dt><code>-mkernel</code><dd><a name="index-mkernel-1759"></a>Enable kernel development mode.  The <samp><span class="option">-mkernel</span></samp> option sets

applicable.  This mode also sets <samp><span class="option">-mno-altivec</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mlong-branch</span></samp> for PowerPC targets.

By default <code>sizeof(bool)</code> is <code>4</code> when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and <code>1</code> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The <samp><span class="option">-mone-byte-bool</span></samp> switch causes GCC
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.11 DEC Alpha Options</h4>

<p>These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mno-soft-float</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsoft_002dfloat-1829"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-1830"></a>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> is specified,
functions in <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

     <p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-reg</code><dt><code>-mno-fp-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dreg-1831"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfp_002dregs-1832"></a>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set. 
<samp><span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in <code>$0</code> instead of <code>$f0</code>.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span></samp> must also be compiled with that
option.

     <p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee</code><dd><a name="index-mieee-1833"></a>The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
<em>except</em> that the <var>inexact-flag</var> is not maintained (see below). 
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro <code>_IEEE_FP</code> is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option <samp><span class="option">-ieee_with_no_inexact</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee-with-inexact</code><dd><a name="index-mieee_002dwith_002dinexact-1834"></a>This is like <samp><span class="option">-mieee</span></samp> except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE <var>inexact-flag</var>.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
<code>_IEEE_FP</code>, <code>_IEEE_FP_EXACT</code> is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the <var>inexact-flag</var>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option <samp><span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-trap-mode=</code><var>trap-mode</var><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dtrap_002dmode-1835"></a>This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled. 
Other Alpha compilers call this option <samp><span class="option">-fptm </span><var>trap-mode</var></samp>. 
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>In addition to the traps enabled by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, underflow traps are enabled

<samp><span class="option">-fprm </span><var>rounding-mode</var></samp>.  The <var>rounding-mode</var> can be one
of:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Round towards minus infinity.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(<var>fpcr</var>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
<var>fpcr</var>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo; corresponds to round towards plus infinity. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>-mtrap-precision=</code><var>trap-precision</var><dd><a name="index-mtrap_002dprecision-1837"></a>In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated. 
GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap. 
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception. 
</dl>

     <p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<samp><span class="option">-scope_safe</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-resumption_safe</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee-conformant</code><dd><a name="index-mieee_002dconformant-1838"></a>This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not

<samp><span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=su</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=sui</span></samp>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.eflag 48</span></samp>&rsquo; in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.

     <br><dt><code>-mbuild-constants</code><dd><a name="index-mbuild_002dconstants-1839"></a>Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.

     <p>Use this option to require GCC to construct <em>all</em> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).

     <p>You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

(the <code>.sdata</code> and <code>.sbss</code> sections) and are accessed via
16-bit relocations off of the <code>$gp</code> register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-mlarge-data</span></samp>.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use <code>malloc</code> or <code>mmap</code> to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.

     <p>When generating code for shared libraries, <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> implies
<samp><span class="option">-msmall-data</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">-mlarge-data</span></samp>.

code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When <samp><span class="option">-msmall-data</span></samp>
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same <code>$gp</code> value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.

These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-march=</code><var>architecture-type</var><dd><a name="index-march-1934"></a>Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
<var>architecture-type</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.0</span></samp>&rsquo; for PA 1.0, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.1</span></samp>&rsquo; for PA
1.1, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2.0</span></samp>&rsquo; for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/sched.models</span></samp> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures runs on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.

     <br><dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-0</code><dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-1</code><dt><code>-mpa-risc-2-0</code><dd><a name="index-mpa_002drisc_002d1_002d0-1935"></a><a name="index-mpa_002drisc_002d1_002d1-1936"></a><a name="index-mpa_002drisc_002d2_002d0-1937"></a>Synonyms for <samp><span class="option">-march=1.0</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-march=1.1</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-march=2.0</span></samp> respectively.

     <br><dt><code>-mcaller-copies</code><dd><a name="index-mcaller_002dcopies-1938"></a>The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden reference.  This
option should be used with care as it is not compatible with the default
32-bit runtime.  However, only aggregates larger than eight bytes are
passed by hidden reference and the option provides better compatibility
with OpenMP.

     <br><dt><code>-mjump-in-delay</code><dd><a name="index-mjump_002din_002ddelay-1939"></a>This option is ignored and provided for compatibility purposes only.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-fpregs</code><dd><a name="index-mdisable_002dfpregs-1940"></a>Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-indexing</code><dd><a name="index-mdisable_002dindexing-1941"></a>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-space-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dspace_002dregs-1942"></a>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

     <p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

     <br><dt><code>-mfast-indirect-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mfast_002dindirect_002dcalls-1943"></a>Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code that performs faster indirect calls.

     <p>This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mfixed-range=</code><var>register-range</var><dd><a name="index-mfixed_002drange-1944"></a>Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers. 
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-load-store</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002dload_002dstore-1945"></a>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+k</span></samp>&rsquo; option to
the HP compilers.

     <br><dt><code>-mportable-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-mportable_002druntime-1946"></a>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

     <br><dt><code>-mgas</code><dd><a name="index-mgas-1947"></a>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

     <br><dt><code>-mschedule=</code><var>cpu-type</var><dd><a name="index-mschedule-1948"></a>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<var>cpu-type</var>.  The choices for <var>cpu-type</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">700</span></samp>&rsquo;
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7100</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7100LC</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7200</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7300</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8000</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Refer
to <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/sched.models</span></samp> on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8000</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mlinker-opt</code><dd><a name="index-mlinker_002dopt-1949"></a>Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-1950"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-msio</code><dd><a name="index-msio-1951"></a>Generate the predefine, <code>_SIO</code>, for server IO.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mwsio</span></samp>.  This generates the predefines, <code>__hp9000s700</code>,
<code>__hp9000s700__</code> and <code>_WSIO</code>, for workstation IO.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

     <br><dt><code>-mgnu-ld</code><dd><a name="index-mgnu_002dld-1952"></a>Use options specific to GNU <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>. 
This passes <samp><span class="option">-shared</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> when
building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does not
affect which <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> that is called is determined by the
<samp><span class="option">--with-ld</span></samp> configure option, GCC's program search path, and
finally by the user's <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed
using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This option is only available
on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa*64*-*-hpux*</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mhp-ld</code><dd><a name="index-mhp_002dld-1953"></a>Use options specific to HP <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>. 
This passes <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> when building
a shared library and passes <samp><span class="option">+Accept TypeMismatch</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> on all
links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not affect
which <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
<samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> that is called is determined by the <samp><span class="option">--with-ld</span></samp>
configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This option is only available on the 64-bit
HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa*64*-*-hpux*</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dlong_002dcalls-1954"></a>Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.

     <p>Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
<samp><span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span></samp> option, or when using the <samp><span class="option">-mgas</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-mno-portable-runtime</span></samp> options together under HP-UX with
the SOM linker.

     <p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

     <p>The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small. 
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
and it is quite long.

     <br><dt><code>-munix=</code><var>unix-std</var><dd><a name="index-march-1955"></a>Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
UNIX standard.  The choices for <var>unix-std</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">93</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">95</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">98</span></samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">93</span></samp>&rsquo; is supported on all HP-UX versions.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">95</span></samp>&rsquo;
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">98</span></samp>&rsquo; is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">93</span></samp>&rsquo; for HP-UX 10.00,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">95</span></samp>&rsquo; for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">98</span></samp>&rsquo; for HP-UX 11.11
and later.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-munix=93</span></samp> provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4. 
<samp><span class="option">-munix=95</span></samp> provides additional predefines for <code>XOPEN_UNIX</code>
and <code>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</code>, and the startfile <samp><span class="file">unix95.o</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="option">-munix=98</span></samp> provides additional predefines for <code>_XOPEN_UNIX</code>,
<code>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</code>, <code>_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE</code> and
<code>_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500</code>, and the startfile <samp><span class="file">unix98.o</span></samp>.

     <p>It is <em>important</em> to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, <em>extreme</em> care is needed in using this
option.

     <p>Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX
standard must test, set and restore the variable <code>__xpg4_extended_mask</code>
as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't provide this capability.

     <br><dt><code>-nolibdld</code><dd><a name="index-nolibdld-1956"></a>Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
<samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

     <br><dt><code>-static</code><dd><a name="index-static-1957"></a>The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.

     <p>On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp> option is specified. 
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
<samp><span class="option">-nolibdld</span></samp> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
adding these link options.

     <br><dt><code>-threads</code><dd><a name="index-threads-1958"></a>Add support for multithreading with the <dfn>dce thread</dfn> library
under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
linker.

     <p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

     <p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those

<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code> variables on a 32-bit
boundary (<samp><span class="option">-malign-int</span></samp>) or a 16-bit boundary (<samp><span class="option">-mno-align-int</span></samp>). 
Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the <samp><span class="option">-malign-int</span></samp> switch, GCC
aligns structures containing the above types differently than
most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

     <br><dt><code>-mpcrel</code><dd><a name="index-mpcrel-2086"></a>Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of
using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp>,
allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing.  <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> is
not presently supported with <samp><span class="option">-mpcrel</span></samp>, though this could be supported for
68020 and higher processors.

     <br><dt><code>-msep-data</code><dd>Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute-in-place in
an environment without virtual memory management.  This option implies
<samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-sep-data</code><dd>Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment. 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mid-shared-library</code><dd>Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method. 
This allows for execute-in-place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-id-shared-library</code><dd>Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used. 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mshared-library-id=n</code><dd>Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library, but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

     <br><dt><code>-mxgot</code><dt><code>-mno-xgot</code><dd><a name="index-mxgot-2089"></a><a name="index-mno_002dxgot-2090"></a>When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the GOT has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> suffices.

     <p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT. 
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:

     <p><a name="index-relocation-truncated-to-fit-_0028ColdFire_0029-2091"></a>
     <pre class="smallexample">          relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar
</pre>
     <p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with <samp><span class="option">-mxgot</span></samp>. 
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
<samp><span class="option">-mxgot</span></samp> is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.

     <p>Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use <samp><span class="option">-mxgot</span></samp> when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries.  Very few do.

     <p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
position-independent code.

The special value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">from-abi</span></samp>&rsquo; selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mips1</span></samp>&rsquo; for 32-bit ABIs and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mips3</span></samp>&rsquo; for 64-bit ABIs).

     <p>The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor. 
<samp><span class="option">-march=native</span></samp> has no effect if GCC does not recognize
the processor.

     <p>In processor names, a final &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">000</span></samp>&rsquo; can be abbreviated as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo;
(for example, <samp><span class="option">-march=r2k</span></samp>).  Prefixes are optional, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vr</span></samp>&rsquo; may be written &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Names of the form &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f2_1</span></samp>&rsquo; refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
&lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f1_1</span></samp>&rsquo; refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f3_2</span></samp>&rsquo; refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core. 
For compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; is accepted as a synonym
for &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f2_1</span></samp>&rsquo; while &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><var>b</var><span class="samp">fx</span></samp>&rsquo; are
accepted as synonyms for &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">f1_1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is <code>_MIPS_ARCH</code>, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form <code>_MIPS_ARCH_</code><var>foo</var>,
where <var>foo</var> is the capitalized value of <code>_MIPS_ARCH</code>. 
For example, <samp><span class="option">-march=r2000</span></samp> sets <code>_MIPS_ARCH</code>
to <code>"r2000"</code> and defines the macro <code>_MIPS_ARCH_R2000</code>.

     <p>Note that the <code>_MIPS_ARCH</code> macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">000</span></samp>&rsquo; as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the case of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">from-abi</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either <code>"mips1"</code> or
<code>"mips3"</code>).  It names the default architecture when no
<samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> option is given.

     <br><dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>arch</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-2169"></a>Optimize for <var>arch</var>.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of <var>arch</var> values is the same as for
<samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>.

     <p>When this option is not used, GCC optimizes for the processor
specified by <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>.  By using <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> together, it is possible to generate code that
runs on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> defines the macros <code>_MIPS_TUNE</code> and
<code>_MIPS_TUNE_</code><var>foo</var>, which work in the same way as the
<samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp> ones described above.

     <p>Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC normally
generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you
can use <samp><span class="option">-mgp32</span></samp> to get 32-bit code instead.

     <p>For information about the O64 ABI, see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</a>.

     <p>GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
<samp><span class="option">-mabi=32</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-mfp64</span></samp>.  This ABI relies on the <code>mthc1</code>
and <code>mfhc1</code> instructions and is therefore only supported for
MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.

     <p>The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register
rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$f0</span></samp>&rsquo; only, not a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$f0</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$f1</span></samp>&rsquo; pair.  The set of call-saved registers also
remains the same in that the even-numbered double-precision registers
are saved.

     <p>Two additional variants of the o32 ABI are supported to enable
a transition from 32-bit to 64-bit registers.  These are FPXX
(<samp><span class="option">-mfpxx</span></samp>) and FP64A (<samp><span class="option">-mfp64</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-mno-odd-spreg</span></samp>). 
The FPXX extension mandates that all code must execute correctly
when run using 32-bit or 64-bit registers.  The code can be interlinked
with either FP32 or FP64, but not both. 
The FP64A extension is similar to the FP64 extension but forbids the
use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.  This can be used
in conjunction with the <code>FRE</code> mode of FPUs in MIPS32R5
processors and allows both FP32 and FP64A code to interlink and
run in the same process without changing FPU modes.

     <br><dt><code>-mabicalls</code><dt><code>-mno-abicalls</code><dd><a name="index-mabicalls-2195"></a><a name="index-mno_002dabicalls-2196"></a>Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for SVR4-style
dynamic objects.  <samp><span class="option">-mabicalls</span></samp> is the default for SVR4-based
systems.

     <br><dt><code>-mshared</code><dt><code>-mno-shared</code><dd>Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent,
and that can therefore be linked into shared libraries.  This option
only affects <samp><span class="option">-mabicalls</span></samp>.

     <p>All <samp><span class="option">-mabicalls</span></samp> code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like <samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp>.  However,
as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter GP
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by <samp><span class="option">-mno-shared</span></samp>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mno-shared</span></samp> depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.  However, the option
does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only affects the ABI
of relocatable objects.  Using <samp><span class="option">-mno-shared</span></samp> generally makes
executables both smaller and quicker.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mshared</span></samp> is the default.

<samp><span class="option">-mno-shared -mabicalls</span></samp>.  For the n64 ABI, this option

     <p>You can make <samp><span class="option">-mplt</span></samp> the default by configuring
GCC with <samp><span class="option">--with-mips-plt</span></samp>.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mno-plt</span></samp> otherwise.

offset table.

     <p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT. 
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:

     <p><a name="index-relocation-truncated-to-fit-_0028MIPS_0029-2201"></a>
     <pre class="smallexample">          relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
</pre>
     <p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with <samp><span class="option">-mxgot</span></samp>. 
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.

     <p>Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use <samp><span class="option">-mxgot</span></samp> when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries.  Very few do.

     <p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position
independent code.

side effects of speculation on R10K processors.

     <p>In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the &ldquo;taken&rdquo; branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.

     <p>This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a DMA operation writes to the
same area of memory before the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.

     <p>One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  <samp><span class="option">-mr10k-cache-barrier=</span><var>setting</var></samp>
controls GCC's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;

          <li>the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;

          <li>the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
          </ol>

     <p>It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.

     <p>If the input program contains a function declaration such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void foo (void);
</pre>
     <p>then the implementation of <code>foo</code> must allow <code>j foo</code> and
<code>jal foo</code> to be executed speculatively.  GCC honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.

     <p>The option has three forms:

          <dl>
<dt><code>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store</code><dd>Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even

slot is successfully filled.  If the delay slot is not filled, a compact
branch will be chosen if one is available.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-exceptions</code><dt><code>-mno-fp-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dexceptions-2301"></a>Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects how
FP instructions are scheduled for some processors. 
The default is that FP exceptions are
enabled.

     <p>For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting
64-bit code, then we can use both FP pipes.  Otherwise, we can only use one
FP pipe.

     <br><dt><code>-mvr4130-align</code><dt><code>-mno-vr4130-align</code><dd><a name="index-mvr4130_002dalign-2302"></a>The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two
instructions together if the first one is 8-byte aligned.  When this
option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of instructions that it
thinks should execute in parallel.

     <p>This option only has an effect when optimizing for the VR4130. 
It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of making it bigger. 
It is enabled by default at optimization level <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-msynci</code><dt><code>-mno-synci</code><dd><a name="index-msynci-2303"></a>Enable (disable) generation of <code>synci</code> instructions on
architectures that support it.  The <code>synci</code> instructions (if
enabled) are generated when <code>__builtin___clear_cache</code> is
compiled.

     <p>This option defaults to <samp><span class="option">-mno-synci</span></samp>, but the default can be
overridden by configuring GCC with <samp><span class="option">--with-synci</span></samp>.

     <p>When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe
to use <code>synci</code>.  However, on many multi-core (SMP) systems, it
does not invalidate the instruction caches on all cores and may lead
to undefined behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-mrelax-pic-calls</code><dt><code>-mno-relax-pic-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mrelax_002dpic_002dcalls-2304"></a>Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via register
<code>$25</code> into direct calls.  This is only possible if the linker can
resolve the destination at link time and if the destination is within
range for a direct call.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mrelax-pic-calls</span></samp> is the default if GCC was configured to use
an assembler and a linker that support the <code>.reloc</code> assembly
directive and <samp><span class="option">-mexplicit-relocs</span></samp> is in effect.  With
<samp><span class="option">-mno-explicit-relocs</span></samp>, this optimization can be performed by the
assembler and the linker alone without help from the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-mmcount-ra-address</code><dt><code>-mno-mcount-ra-address</code><dd><a name="index-mmcount_002dra_002daddress-2305"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmcount_002dra_002daddress-2306"></a>Emit (do not emit) code that allows <code>_mcount</code> to modify the
calling function's return address.  When enabled, this option extends
the usual <code>_mcount</code> interface with a new <var>ra-address</var>
parameter, which has type <code>intptr_t *</code> and is passed in register
<code>$12</code>.  <code>_mcount</code> can then modify the return address by
doing both of the following:
          <ul>
<li>Returning the new address in register <code>$31</code>. 
<li>Storing the new address in <code>*</code><var>ra-address</var>,
if <var>ra-address</var> is nonnull. 
</ul>

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-mcount-ra-address</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mframe-header-opt</code><dt><code>-mno-frame-header-opt</code><dd><a name="index-mframe_002dheader_002dopt-2307"></a>Enable (disable) frame header optimization in the o32 ABI.  When using the
o32 ABI, calling functions will allocate 16 bytes on the stack for the called
function to write out register arguments.  When enabled, this optimization
will suppress the allocation of the frame header if it can be determined that
it is unused.

     <p>This optimization is off by default at all optimization levels.

     <br><dt><code>-mlxc1-sxc1</code><dt><code>-mno-lxc1-sxc1</code><dd><a name="index-mlxc1_002dsxc1-2308"></a>When applicable, enable (disable) the generation of <code>lwxc1</code>,
<code>swxc1</code>, <code>ldxc1</code>, <code>sdxc1</code> instructions.  Enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mmadd4</code><dt><code>-mno-madd4</code><dd><a name="index-mmadd4-2309"></a>When applicable, enable (disable) the generation of 4-operand <code>madd.s</code>,
<code>madd.d</code> and related instructions.  Enabled by default.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.30 MSP430 Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-MSP430-Options-2350"></a>
These options are defined for the MSP430:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-masm-hex</code><dd><a name="index-masm_002dhex-2351"></a>Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally such
constants are signed decimals, but this option is available for
testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.

     <br><dt><code>-mmcu=</code><dd><a name="index-mmcu_003d-2352"></a>Select the MCU to target.  This is used to create a C preprocessor
symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to upper case and pre- and
post-fixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This in turn is used by the
<samp><span class="file">msp430.h</span></samp> header file to select an MCU-specific supplementary
header file.

     <p>The option also sets the ISA to use.  If the MCU name is one that is
known to only support the 430 ISA then that is selected, otherwise the
430X ISA is selected.  A generic MCU name of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msp430</span></samp>&rsquo; can also be
used to select the 430 ISA.  Similarly the generic &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msp430x</span></samp>&rsquo; MCU
name selects the 430X ISA.

     <p>In addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the linker
command line.  The script's name is the name of the MCU with
<samp><span class="file">.ld</span></samp> appended.  Thus specifying <samp><span class="option">-mmcu=xxx</span></samp> on the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>
command line defines the C preprocessor symbol <code>__XXX__</code> and
cause the linker to search for a script called <samp><span class="file">xxx.ld</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is also passed on to the assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-mwarn-mcu</code><dt><code>-mno-warn-mcu</code><dd><a name="index-mwarn_002dmcu-2353"></a><a name="index-mno_002dwarn_002dmcu-2354"></a>This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts between the
MCU name specified by the <samp><span class="option">-mmcu</span></samp> option and the ISA set by the
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the
<samp><span class="option">-mhwmult</span></samp> option.  It also toggles warnings about unrecognized
MCU names.  This option is on by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><dd><a name="index-mcpu_003d-2355"></a>Specifies the ISA to use.  Accepted values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msp430</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msp430x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msp430xv2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This option is deprecated.  The
<samp><span class="option">-mmcu=</span></samp> option should be used to select the ISA.

     <br><dt><code>-msim</code><dd><a name="index-msim-2356"></a>Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.  Overrides
any scripts that would be selected by the <samp><span class="option">-mmcu=</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-mlarge</code><dd><a name="index-mlarge-2357"></a>Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 32-bit <code>size_t</code>).

     <br><dt><code>-msmall</code><dd><a name="index-msmall-2358"></a>Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit <code>size_t</code>).

     <br><dt><code>-mrelax</code><dd><a name="index-mrelax-2359"></a>This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the
linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until
the final link.

     <br><dt><code>mhwmult=</code><dd><a name="index-mhwmult_003d-2360"></a>Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target. 
Accepted values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; for no hardware multiply, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">16bit</span></samp>&rsquo;
for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">32bit</span></samp>&rsquo; for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f5series</span></samp>&rsquo; for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs. 
A value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; can also be given.  This tells GCC to deduce
the hardware multiply support based upon the MCU name provided by the
<samp><span class="option">-mmcu</span></samp> option.  If no <samp><span class="option">-mmcu</span></samp> option is specified or if
the MCU name is not recognized then no hardware multiply support is
assumed.  <code>auto</code> is the default setting.

     <p>Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a library
routine.  This saves space in the generated code.  When compiling at
<samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> or higher however the hardware multiplier is invoked
inline.  This makes for bigger, but faster code.

     <p>The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and
restore the previous interrupt state when they finish.  This makes
them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in normal code.

     <br><dt><code>-minrt</code><dd><a name="index-minrt-2361"></a>Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
initializers or constructors.  This is intended for memory-constrained
devices.  The compiler includes special symbols in some objects
that tell the linker and runtime which code fragments are required.

     <br><dt><code>-mcode-region=</code><dt><code>-mdata-region=</code><dd><a name="index-mcode_002dregion-2362"></a><a name="index-mdata_002dregion-2363"></a>These options tell the compiler where to place functions and data that
do not have one of the <code>lower</code>, <code>upper</code>, <code>either</code> or
<code>section</code> attributes.  Possible values are <code>lower</code>,
<code>upper</code>, <code>either</code> or <code>any</code>.  The first three behave
like the corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value -
<code>any</code> - is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the
linker script and how it assigns the standard sections
(<code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>, etc) to the memory regions.

     <br><dt><code>-msilicon-errata=</code><dd><a name="index-msilicon_002derrata-2364"></a>This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the fixes for
the named silicon errata.

     <br><dt><code>-msilicon-errata-warn=</code><dd><a name="index-msilicon_002derrata_002dwarn-2365"></a>This option passes on a request to the assembler to enable warning
messages when a silicon errata might need to be applied.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mgpopt</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-mgpopt=local</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="option">-mno-gpopt</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-mgpopt=none</span></samp>.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-mgpopt</span></samp> except when <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp> is specified to generate position-independent code. 
Note that the Nios II ABI does not permit GP-relative accesses from
shared libraries.

     <p>You may need to specify <samp><span class="option">-mno-gpopt</span></samp> explicitly when building
programs that include large amounts of small data, including large
GOT data sections.  In this case, the 16-bit offset for GP-relative
addressing may not be large enough to allow access to the entire
small data section.

GP-relative addressing.  It is most useful in conjunction with
<code>section</code> attributes on variable declarations
(see <a href="#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>) and a custom linker script. 
The <var>regexp</var> is a POSIX Extended Regular Expression.

     <p>This option does not affect the behavior of the <samp><span class="option">-G</span></samp> option, and
the specified sections are in addition to the standard <code>.sdata</code>
and <code>.sbss</code> small-data sections that are recognized by <samp><span class="option">-mgpopt</span></samp>.

of the 32-bit address space.  It is most useful in conjunction with
<code>section</code> attributes on variable declarations
(see <a href="#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>) and a custom linker script. 
The <var>regexp</var> is a POSIX Extended Regular Expression.

     <p>In contrast to the use of GP-relative addressing for small data,
zero-based addressing is never generated by default and there are no
conventional section names used in standard linker scripts for sections
in the low or high areas of memory.

of the default behavior of using a library call.

     <p>The following values of <var>insn</var> are supported.  Except as otherwise

     <p>In addition, all of the following transfer instructions for internal
registers X and Y must be provided to use any of the double-precision
floating-point instructions.  Custom instructions taking two
double-precision source operands expect the first operand in the
64-bit register X.  The other operand (or only operand of a unary
operation) is given to the custom arithmetic instruction with the
least significant half in source register <var>src1</var> and the most
significant half in <var>src2</var>.  A custom instruction that returns a
double-precision result returns the most significant 32 bits in the
destination register and the other half in 32-bit register Y. 
GCC automatically generates the necessary code sequences to write
register X and/or read register Y when double-precision floating-point
instructions are used.

variable-length arrays or <code>alloca</code>), and when global memory is used for
underlying storage, makes it possible to access automatic variables from other
threads, or with atomic instructions. This code generation variant is used
for OpenMP offloading, but the option is exposed on its own for the purpose

in each warp was active outside of OpenMP SIMD regions.  All atomic operations
and calls to runtime (malloc, free, vprintf) are conditionally executed (iff
current lane index equals the master lane index), and the register being
assigned is copied via a shuffle instruction from the master lane.  Outside of
SIMD regions lane 0 is the master; inside, each thread sees itself as the
master.  Shared memory array <code>int __nvptx_uni[]</code> stores all-zeros or
all-ones bitmasks for each warp, indicating current mode (0 outside of SIMD
regions).  Each thread can bitwise-and the bitmask at position <code>tid.y</code>
with current lane index to compute the master lane index.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.35 picoChip Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-picoChip-options-2452"></a>
These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for picoChip implementations:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mae=</code><var>ae_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-2453"></a>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for array element type <var>ae_type</var>.  Supported values
for <var>ae_type</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ANY</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MUL</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MAC</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mae=ANY</span></samp> selects a completely generic AE type.  Code
generated with this option runs on any of the other AE types.  The
code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
AE type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not
work properly on all types of AE.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mae=MUL</span></samp> selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE type
for compiled code, and is the default.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mae=MAC</span></samp> selects a DSP-style MAC AE.  Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the DSP AE does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.

     <br><dt><code>-msymbol-as-address</code><dd>Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a
load/store instruction, without first loading it into a
register.  Typically, the use of this option generates larger
programs, which run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the
results vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
rather than being permanently enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-inefficient-warnings</code><dd>Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type.  The MAC AE has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an AE type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.37 PowerPC SPE Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-PowerPC-SPE-options-2455"></a>
These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are defined for PowerPC SPE:
     <dl>
<dt><code>-mmfcrf</code><dt><code>-mno-mfcrf</code><dt><code>-mpopcntb</code><dt><code>-mno-popcntb</code><dd><a name="index-mmfcrf-2456"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmfcrf-2457"></a><a name="index-mpopcntb-2458"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpopcntb-2459"></a>You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var></samp> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var></samp> option
rather than the options listed above.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-mmfcrf</span></samp> option allows GCC to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the POWER4
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture. 
The <samp><span class="option">-mpopcntb</span></samp> option allows GCC to generate the popcount and
double-precision FP reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
POWER5 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-2460"></a>Set architecture type, register usage, and
instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>. 
Supported values for <var>cpu_type</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8540</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8548</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-mcpu=powerpc</span></samp> specifies pure 32-bit PowerPC (either
endian), with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for
scheduling purposes.

     <p>Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; as cpu type detects and selects the
architecture option that corresponds to the host processor of the
system performing the compilation. 
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=native</span></samp> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
processor.

     <p>The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options runs best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> options automatically enable or disable the
following options:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -mhard-float  -mmfcrf  -mmultiple 
          -mpopcntb -mpopcntd 
          -msingle-float -mdouble-float 
          -mfloat128
</pre>
     <p>The particular options set for any particular CPU varies between
compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce optimal
code for that CPU; it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's
capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual option to a particular
value, you may specify it after the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> option, like
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=8548</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-2461"></a>Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<var>cpu_type</var>, but do not set the architecture type or register usage,
as <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var></samp> does.  The same
values for <var>cpu_type</var> are used for <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> as for
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp>.  If both are specified, the code generated uses the
architecture and registers set by <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp>, but the
scheduling parameters set by <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-msecure-plt</code><dd><a name="index-msecure_002dplt-2462"></a>Generate code that allows <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ld.so</span></samp>
to build executables and shared
libraries with non-executable <code>.plt</code> and <code>.got</code> sections. 
This is a PowerPC
32-bit SYSV ABI option.

     <br><dt><code>-mbss-plt</code><dd><a name="index-mbss_002dplt-2463"></a>Generate code that uses a BSS <code>.plt</code> section that <samp><span class="command">ld.so</span></samp>
fills in, and
requires <code>.plt</code> and <code>.got</code>
sections that are both writable and executable. 
This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.

     <br><dt><code>-misel</code><dt><code>-mno-isel</code><dd><a name="index-misel-2464"></a><a name="index-mno_002disel-2465"></a>This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-misel=</code><var>yes/no</var><dd>This switch has been deprecated.  Use <samp><span class="option">-misel</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mno-isel</span></samp> instead.

     <br><dt><code>-mspe</code><dt><code>-mno-spe</code><dd><a name="index-mspe-2466"></a><a name="index-mno_002dspe-2467"></a>This switch enables or disables the generation of SPE simd
instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mspe=</code><var>yes/no</var><dd>This option has been deprecated.  Use <samp><span class="option">-mspe</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mno-spe</span></samp> instead.

     <br><dt><code>-mfloat128</code><dt><code>-mno-float128</code><dd><a name="index-mfloat128-2468"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfloat128-2469"></a>Enable/disable the <var>__float128</var> keyword for IEEE 128-bit floating point
and use either software emulation for IEEE 128-bit floating point or
hardware instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mfloat-gprs=</code><var>yes/single/double/no</var><dt><code>-mfloat-gprs</code><dd><a name="index-mfloat_002dgprs-2470"></a>This switch enables or disables the generation of floating-point
operations on the general-purpose registers for architectures that
support it.

     <p>The argument &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">single</span></samp>&rsquo; enables the use of
single-precision floating-point operations.

     <p>The argument &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">double</span></samp>&rsquo; enables the use of single and
double-precision floating-point operations.

     <p>The argument &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo; disables floating-point operations on the
general-purpose registers.

     <p>This option is currently only available on the MPC854x.

     <br><dt><code>-mfull-toc</code><dt><code>-mno-fp-in-toc</code><dt><code>-mno-sum-in-toc</code><dt><code>-mminimal-toc</code><dd><a name="index-mfull_002dtoc-2471"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfp_002din_002dtoc-2472"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsum_002din_002dtoc-2473"></a><a name="index-mminimal_002dtoc-2474"></a>Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The <samp><span class="option">-mfull-toc</span></samp> option is selected by
default.  In that case, GCC allocates at least one TOC entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
also places floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

     <p>If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used
with the <samp><span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span></samp> options. 
<samp><span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span></samp> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and <samp><span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span></samp> forces GCC to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

     <p>If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of
these options, specify <samp><span class="option">-mminimal-toc</span></samp> instead.  This option causes
GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, GCC produces code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently-executed code.

     <br><dt><code>-maix32</code><dd><a name="index-maix32-2475"></a>Disables the 64-bit ABI.  GCC defaults to <samp><span class="option">-maix32</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mxl-compat</code><dt><code>-mno-xl-compat</code><dd><a name="index-mxl_002dcompat-2476"></a><a name="index-mno_002dxl_002dcompat-2477"></a>Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use XL symbol names for long double
support routines.

     <p>The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  IBM XL
compilers access floating-point arguments that do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by IBM
XL compilers without optimization.

     <br><dt><code>-malign-natural</code><dt><code>-malign-power</code><dd><a name="index-malign_002dnatural-2478"></a><a name="index-malign_002dpower-2479"></a>On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option
<samp><span class="option">-malign-natural</span></samp> overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger
types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based boundary. 
The option <samp><span class="option">-malign-power</span></samp> instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified
alignment rules.  GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the ABI.

     <p>On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and <samp><span class="option">-malign-power</span></samp>
is not supported.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-2480"></a><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-2481"></a>Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set. 
Software floating-point emulation is provided if you use the
<samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.

     <br><dt><code>-msingle-float</code><dt><code>-mdouble-float</code><dd><a name="index-msingle_002dfloat-2482"></a><a name="index-mdouble_002dfloat-2483"></a>Generate code for single- or double-precision floating-point operations. 
<samp><span class="option">-mdouble-float</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">-msingle-float</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mmultiple</code><dt><code>-mno-multiple</code><dd><a name="index-mmultiple-2484"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmultiple-2485"></a>Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <samp><span class="option">-mmultiple</span></samp> on little-endian
PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little-endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and
PPC750 which permit these instructions in little-endian mode.

     <br><dt><code>-mupdate</code><dt><code>-mno-update</code><dd><a name="index-mupdate-2486"></a><a name="index-mno_002dupdate-2487"></a>Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
<samp><span class="option">-mno-update</span></samp>, there is a small window between the time that the
stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous frame is
stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts or
signals may get corrupted data.

     <br><dt><code>-mavoid-indexed-addresses</code><dt><code>-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses</code><dd><a name="index-mavoid_002dindexed_002daddresses-2488"></a><a name="index-mno_002davoid_002dindexed_002daddresses-2489"></a>Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of indexed load
or store instructions. These instructions can incur a performance
penalty on Power6 processors in certain situations, such as when
stepping through large arrays that cross a 16M boundary.  This option
is enabled by default when targeting Power6 and disabled otherwise.

if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
<samp><span class="option">-mfused-madd</span></samp> option is now mapped to the machine-independent
<samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span></samp> option, and <samp><span class="option">-mno-fused-madd</span></samp> is

contains two parts: the size of integer types and the registers used for
floating-point types.  For example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64d</span></samp>&rsquo; means that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long</span></samp>&rsquo; and pointers are 64-bit (implicitly defining &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; to be
32-bit), and that floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F
registers.  Contrast this with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64f</span></samp>&rsquo;, which still
allows the compiler to generate code that uses the F and D extensions but only
allows floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64</span></samp>&rsquo;, in which no floating-point arguments will be
passed in registers.

     <p>The default for this argument is system dependent, users who want a specific
calling convention should specify one explicitly.  The valid calling
conventions are: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ilp32</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ilp32f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ilp32d</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lp64</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lp64f</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lp64d</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Some calling conventions are impossible to
implement on some ISAs: for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-march=rv32if -mabi=ilp32d</span></samp>&rsquo; is
invalid because the ABI requires 64-bit values be passed in F registers, but F
registers are only 32 bits wide.

be used.  The simplest is <code>none</code>, which uses software for both
multiplication and division.  This is the default.  The <code>g13</code>
value is for the hardware multiply/divide peripheral found on the
RL78/G13 (S2 core) targets.  The <code>g14</code> value selects the use of
the multiplication and division instructions supported by the RL78/G14
(S3 core) parts.  The value <code>rl78</code> is an alias for <code>g14</code> and
the value <code>mg10</code> is an alias for <code>none</code>.

     <p>In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the setting
of this option.  Possible values are: <code>__RL78_MUL_NONE__</code>,
<code>__RL78_MUL_G13__</code> or <code>__RL78_MUL_G14__</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=g10</code><dt><code>-mcpu=g13</code><dt><code>-mcpu=g14</code><dt><code>-mcpu=rl78</code><dd><a name="index-mcpu-2583"></a>Specifies the RL78 core to target.  The default is the G14 core, also
known as an S3 core or just RL78.  The G13 or S2 core does not have
multiply or divide instructions, instead it uses a hardware peripheral
for these operations.  The G10 or S1 core does not have register
banks, so it uses a different calling convention.

     <p>If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware multiply
support to use, unless this is overridden by an explicit
<samp><span class="option">-mmul=none</span></samp> option on the command line.  Thus specifying
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=g13</span></samp> enables the use of the G13 hardware multiply
peripheral and specifying <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=g10</span></samp> disables the use of
hardware multiplications altogether.

     <p>Note, although the RL78/G14 core is the default target, specifying
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=g14</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=rl78</span></samp> on the command line does
change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14
hardware multiply support.  If these options are not specified on the
command line then software multiplication routines will be used even
though the code targets the RL78 core.  This is for backwards
compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware
multiply and divide support.

     <p>In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the setting
of this option.  Possible values are: <code>__RL78_G10__</code>,
<code>__RL78_G13__</code> or <code>__RL78_G14__</code>.

registers <code>r24..r31</code> are reserved for use in interrupt handlers.

MDUC registers.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the MDUC registers, for example because it performs multiplication
and division operations.  The default is to ignore the MDUC registers
as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.  The target option -mg13
needs to be passed for this to work as this feature is only available
on the G13 target (S2 core).  The MDUC registers will only be saved
if the interrupt handler performs a multiplication or division
operation or it calls another function.

rather than the options listed above.

     <p>Specifying <samp><span class="option">-mpowerpc-gpopt</span></samp> allows
GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying

architecture machine types, with an appropriate, generic processor
model assumed for scheduling purposes.

     <p>Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; as cpu type detects and selects the

<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=native</span></samp> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the

     <p>The particular options set for any particular CPU varies between

farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location. 
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the <code>shortcall</code> function attribute, or by <code>#pragma
longcall(0)</code>.

     <p>Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX linker can do this,
as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.

     <p>On Darwin/PPC systems, <code>#pragma longcall</code> generates <code>jbsr
callee, L42</code>, plus a <dfn>branch island</dfn> (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a <code>bl
callee</code> if the PPC <code>bl</code> instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates <code>bl L42</code> to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.

     <p>On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

     <p>In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.41 RX Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-RX-Options-2764"></a>
These command-line options are defined for RX targets:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-m64bit-doubles</code><dt><code>-m32bit-doubles</code><dd><a name="index-m64bit_002ddoubles-2765"></a><a name="index-m32bit_002ddoubles-2766"></a>Make the <code>double</code> data type be 64 bits (<samp><span class="option">-m64bit-doubles</span></samp>)
or 32 bits (<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>) in size.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>.  <em>Note</em> RX floating-point hardware only
works on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fpu</code><dt><code>-nofpu</code><dd><a name="index-fpu-2767"></a><a name="index-nofpu-2768"></a>Enables (<samp><span class="option">-fpu</span></samp>) or disables (<samp><span class="option">-nofpu</span></samp>) the use of RX
floating-point hardware.  The default is enabled for the RX600
series and disabled for the RX200 series.

     <p>Floating-point instructions are only generated for 32-bit floating-point
values, however, so the FPU hardware is not used for doubles if the
<samp><span class="option">-m64bit-doubles</span></samp> option is used.

     <p><em>Note</em> If the <samp><span class="option">-fpu</span></samp> option is enabled then
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is also enabled automatically. 
This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-2769"></a>Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types are
supported, the generic &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX200</span></samp>&rsquo; series hardware and
the specific &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>&rsquo; CPU.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>The only difference between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>&rsquo; is that the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>&rsquo; does not support the <code>MVTIPL</code> instruction.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RX200</span></samp>&rsquo; series does not have a hardware floating-point unit
and so <samp><span class="option">-nofpu</span></samp> is enabled by default when this type is
selected.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-endian-data</code><dt><code>-mlittle-endian-data</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian_002ddata-2770"></a><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian_002ddata-2771"></a>Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mlittle-endian-data</span></samp>, i.e. to store data in the little-endian
format.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall-data-limit=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-msmall_002ddata_002dlimit-2772"></a>Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's
registers (usually <code>r13</code>) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.

     <p>Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.

     <p>The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the
description of the <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> option for a description of how the
actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.

     <br><dt><code>-msim</code><dt><code>-mno-sim</code><dd><a name="index-msim-2773"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsim-2774"></a>Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss
board-specific runtime.

     <br><dt><code>-mas100-syntax</code><dt><code>-mno-as100-syntax</code><dd><a name="index-mas100_002dsyntax-2775"></a><a name="index-mno_002das100_002dsyntax-2776"></a>When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS
assembler, but it has some restrictions so it is not generated by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mmax-constant-size=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-mmax_002dconstant_002dsize-2777"></a>Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

     <p>The value <var>N</var> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.

     <br><dt><code>-mrelax</code><dd><a name="index-mrelax-2778"></a>Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mint-register=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-mint_002dregister-2779"></a>Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value <var>N</var> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register <code>r13</code> is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves <code>r13</code> and
<code>r12</code>.  A value of 3 reserves <code>r13</code>, <code>r12</code> and
<code>r11</code>, and a value of 4 reserves <code>r13</code> through <code>r10</code>. 
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.

     <br><dt><code>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</code><dd><a name="index-msave_002dacc_002din_002dinterrupts-2780"></a>Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.

     <br><dt><code>-mpid</code><dt><code>-mno-pid</code><dd><a name="index-mpid-2781"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpid-2782"></a>Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.

     <p>Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <code>r13</code>, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.

     <p>The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the <samp><span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span></samp> and/or the
<samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp> command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register <code>r13</code> and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of <samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp>,
then <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> and finally <samp><span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span></samp>.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <code>r8</code> if both
<samp><span class="option">-mint-register=4</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> are specified on the
command line.

     <p>By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored
via the <samp><span class="option">-mno-pid</span></samp> command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</code><dt><code>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dwarn_002dmultiple_002dfast_002dinterrupts-2783"></a><a name="index-mwarn_002dmultiple_002dfast_002dinterrupts-2784"></a>Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one
fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to
issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler found, as the RX
only supports one such interrupt.

     <br><dt><code>-mallow-string-insns</code><dt><code>-mno-allow-string-insns</code><dd><a name="index-mallow_002dstring_002dinsns-2785"></a><a name="index-mno_002dallow_002dstring_002dinsns-2786"></a>Enables or disables the use of the string manipulation instructions
<code>SMOVF</code>, <code>SCMPU</code>, <code>SMOVB</code>, <code>SMOVU</code>, <code>SUNTIL</code>
<code>SWHILE</code> and also the <code>RMPA</code> instruction.  These
instructions may prefetch data, which is not safe to do if accessing
an I/O register.  (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group User's Manual
for more information).

     <p>The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not possible for
GCC to reliably detect all circumstances where a string instruction
might be used to access an I/O register, so their use cannot be
disabled automatically.  Instead it is reliant upon the programmer to
use the <samp><span class="option">-mno-allow-string-insns</span></samp> option if their program
accesses I/O space.

     <p>When the instructions are enabled GCC defines the C preprocessor
symbol <code>__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__</code>, otherwise it defines the
symbol <code>__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mjsr</code><dt><code>-mno-jsr</code><dd><a name="index-mjsr-2787"></a><a name="index-mno_002djsr-2788"></a>Use only (or not only) <code>JSR</code> instructions to access functions. 
This option can be used when code size exceeds the range of <code>BSR</code>
instructions.  Note that <samp><span class="option">-mno-jsr</span></samp> does not mean to not use
<code>JSR</code> but instead means that any type of branch may be used. 
</dl>

 <p><em>Note:</em> The generic GCC command-line option <samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp>
has special significance to the RX port when used with the
<code>interrupt</code> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC ensures
that it only uses the registers <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>
and/or <code>r13</code> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
<samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp> command-line
options.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.42 S/390 and zSeries Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-S_002f390-and-zSeries-Options-2789"></a>
These are the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-2790"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-2791"></a>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and registers
for floating-point operations.  When <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> is specified,
functions in <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  When <samp><span class="option">-mhard-float</span></samp> is specified, the compiler
generates IEEE floating-point instructions.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-dfp</code><dt><code>-mno-hard-dfp</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002ddfp-2792"></a><a name="index-mno_002dhard_002ddfp-2793"></a>Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point instructions for
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <samp><span class="option">-mno-hard-dfp</span></samp> is
specified, functions in <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp> are used to perform
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <samp><span class="option">-mhard-dfp</span></samp> is
specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware
instructions.  This is the default for <samp><span class="option">-march=z9-ec</span></samp> or higher.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-double-64</code><dt><code>-mlong-double-128</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002ddouble_002d64-2794"></a><a name="index-mlong_002ddouble_002d128-2795"></a>These switches control the size of <code>long double</code> type. A size
of 64 bits makes the <code>long double</code> type equivalent to the <code>double</code>
type. This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mbackchain</code><dt><code>-mno-backchain</code><dd><a name="index-mbackchain-2796"></a><a name="index-mno_002dbackchain-2797"></a>Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame. 
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
DWARF call frame information. 
When <samp><span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span></samp> is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when <samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp> is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.

     <p>In general, code compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mbackchain</span></samp> is call-compatible with
code compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mmo-backchain</span></samp>; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
<samp><span class="option">-mbackchain</span></samp>.  Note that the combination of <samp><span class="option">-mbackchain</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mhard-float</span></samp> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp>.

     <p>The default is to not maintain the backchain.

     <br><dt><code>-mpacked-stack</code><dt><code>-mno-packed-stack</code><dd><a name="index-mpacked_002dstack-2798"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpacked_002dstack-2799"></a>Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When <samp><span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span></samp> is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space. 
When <samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp> is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space. 
However, when <samp><span class="option">-mbackchain</span></samp> is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.

     <p>As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
<samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp> is call-compatible with code generated with
<samp><span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span></samp>.  Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp>.  Also, note that the
combination of <samp><span class="option">-mbackchain</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mhard-float</span></samp> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp>.

     <p>The default is to not use the packed stack layout.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall-exec</code><dt><code>-mno-small-exec</code><dd><a name="index-msmall_002dexec-2800"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsmall_002dexec-2801"></a>Generate (or do not generate) code using the <code>bras</code> instruction
to do subroutine calls. 
This only works reliably if the total executable size does not
exceed 64k.  The default is to use the <code>basr</code> instruction instead,
which does not have this limitation.

     <br><dt><code>-m64</code><dt><code>-m31</code><dd><a name="index-m64-2802"></a><a name="index-m31-2803"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-m31</span></samp> is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI.  When <samp><span class="option">-m64</span></samp> is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows GCC in
particular to generate 64-bit instructions.  For the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s390</span></samp>&rsquo;
targets, the default is <samp><span class="option">-m31</span></samp>, while the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s390x</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt><code>-mzarch</code><dt><code>-mesa</code><dd><a name="index-mzarch-2804"></a><a name="index-mesa-2805"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-mzarch</span></samp> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on z/Architecture. 
When <samp><span class="option">-mesa</span></samp> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on ESA/390.  Note that <samp><span class="option">-mesa</span></samp> is
not possible with <samp><span class="option">-m64</span></samp>. 
When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,
the default is <samp><span class="option">-mesa</span></samp>.  When generating code compliant
to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is <samp><span class="option">-mzarch</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mhtm</code><dt><code>-mno-htm</code><dd><a name="index-mhtm-2806"></a><a name="index-mno_002dhtm-2807"></a>The <samp><span class="option">-mhtm</span></samp> option enables a set of builtins making use of

     <br><dt><code>-mvx</code><dt><code>-mno-vx</code><dd><a name="index-mvx-2808"></a><a name="index-mno_002dvx-2809"></a>When <samp><span class="option">-mvx</span></samp> is specified, generate code using the instructions
available with the vector extension facility introduced with the IBM
z13 machine generation. 
This option changes the ABI for some vector type values with regard to
alignment and calling conventions.  In case vector type values are
being used in an ABI-relevant context a GAS &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.gnu_attribute</span></samp>&rsquo;
command will be added to mark the resulting binary with the ABI used. 
<samp><span class="option">-mvx</span></samp> is enabled by default when using <samp><span class="option">-march=z13</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mzvector</code><dt><code>-mno-zvector</code><dd><a name="index-mzvector-2810"></a><a name="index-mno_002dzvector-2811"></a>The <samp><span class="option">-mzvector</span></samp> option enables vector language extensions and
builtins using instructions available with the vector extension
facility introduced with the IBM z13 machine generation. 
This option adds support for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vector</span></samp>&rsquo; to be used as a keyword to
define vector type variables and arguments.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vector</span></samp>&rsquo; is only
available when GNU extensions are enabled.  It will not be expanded
when requesting strict standard compliance e.g. with <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp>. 
In addition to the GCC low-level builtins <samp><span class="option">-mzvector</span></samp> enables
a set of builtins added for compatibility with AltiVec-style
implementations like Power and Cell.  In order to make use of these
builtins the header file <samp><span class="file">vecintrin.h</span></samp> needs to be included. 
<samp><span class="option">-mzvector</span></samp> is disabled by default.

to perform block moves.  When <samp><span class="option">-mno-mvcle</span></samp> is specified,
use a <code>mvc</code> loop instead.  This is the default unless optimizing for

     <p>Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">native</span></samp>&rsquo; as cpu type can be used to select the best
architecture option for the host processor. 
<samp><span class="option">-march=native</span></samp> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the

The list of <var>cpu-type</var> values is the same as for <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>. 
The default is the value used for <samp><span class="option">-march</span></samp>.

this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program
runs.  It is intended to identify functions that most probably cause
a stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment with limited stack
size e.g. the linux kernel.

     <br><dt><code>-mwarn-dynamicstack</code><dd><a name="index-mwarn_002ddynamicstack-2823"></a>Emit a warning if the function calls <code>alloca</code> or uses dynamically-sized

the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is <var>stack-guard</var>
bytes above the <var>stack-size</var> (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward). 
If the <var>stack-guard</var> option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen. 
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems. 
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and <var>stack-size</var> has to be greater than
<var>stack-guard</var> without exceeding 64k. 
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by <var>stack-size</var>. 
The <var>stack-guard</var> option can only be used in conjunction with <var>stack-size</var>.

the label, 2 * <var>post-halfwords</var> bytes are appended, using the
largest NOP like instructions the architecture allows (maximum
1000000).

     <br><dt><code>-mieee</code><dt><code>-mno-ieee</code><dd><a name="index-mieee-2878"></a><a name="index-mno_002dieee-2879"></a>Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons, which affects the

instruction. 
If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the <code>icbi</code>
instruction, and <samp><span class="option">-musermode</span></samp> is not in effect, the inlined code
manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with an associative
write.  This not only requires privileged mode at run time, but it also
fails if the cache line had been mapped via the TLB and has become unmapped.

     <br><dt><code>-misize</code><dd><a name="index-misize-2881"></a>Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.

     <br><dt><code>-mpadstruct</code><dd><a name="index-mpadstruct-2882"></a>This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes,
which is incompatible with the SH ABI.

     <br><dt><code>-matomic-model=</code><var>model</var><dd><a name="index-matomic_002dmodel_003d_0040var_007bmodel_007d-2883"></a>Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters as a comma
separated list.  For details on the atomic built-in functions see
<a href="#g_t_005f_005fatomic-Builtins">__atomic Builtins</a>.  The following models and parameters are supported:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library calls for atomic
operations.  This is the default if the target is not <code>sh*-*-linux*</code>.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft-gusa</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic
built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is <code>sh*-*-linux*</code> and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is SH4A,
this option also partially utilizes the hardware atomic instructions
<code>movli.l</code> and <code>movco.l</code> to create more efficient code, unless
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">strict</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft-tcb</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control
block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on
SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gbr-offset=</span></samp>&rsquo;
parameter has to be specified as well.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft-imask</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting <code>SR.IMASK = 1111</code>.  This model works only when the program runs
in privileged mode and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
required.  This model is enabled by default when the target is
<code>sh*-*-linux*</code> and SH1* or SH2*.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hard-llcs</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Generate hardware atomic sequences using the <code>movli.l</code> and <code>movco.l</code>
instructions only.  This is only available on SH4A and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses. 
Code compiled with this option is also compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an SH4A
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system is not required for this model.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gbr-offset=</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable in the thread
control block structure that should be used by the generated atomic sequences
when the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">soft-tcb</span></samp>&rsquo; model has been selected.  For other models this
parameter is ignored.  The specified value must be an integer multiple of four
and in the range 0-1020.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">strict</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models, even if they
are compatible, and makes the compiler generate atomic sequences of the
specified model only.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>-mtas</code><dd><a name="index-mtas-2884"></a>Generate the <code>tas.b</code> opcode for <code>__atomic_test_and_set</code>. 
Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software configuration
this can degrade overall performance due to the operand cache line flushes
that are implied by the <code>tas.b</code> instruction.  On multi-core SH4A
processors the <code>tas.b</code> instruction must be used with caution since it
can result in data corruption for certain cache configurations.

     <br><dt><code>-mprefergot</code><dd><a name="index-mprefergot-2885"></a>When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using
the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.

     <br><dt><code>-musermode</code><dt><code>-mno-usermode</code><dd><a name="index-musermode-2886"></a><a name="index-mno_002dusermode-2887"></a>Don't allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.  Specifying
<samp><span class="option">-musermode</span></samp> also implies <samp><span class="option">-mno-inline-ic_invalidate</span></samp> if the
inlined code would not work in user mode.  <samp><span class="option">-musermode</span></samp> is the default
when the target is <code>sh*-*-linux*</code>.  If the target is SH1* or SH2*
<samp><span class="option">-musermode</span></samp> has no effect, since there is no user mode.

     <br><dt><code>-multcost=</code><var>number</var><dd><a name="index-multcost_003d_0040var_007bnumber_007d-2888"></a>Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.

     <br><dt><code>-mdiv=</code><var>strategy</var><dd><a name="index-mdiv_003d_0040var_007bstrategy_007d-2889"></a>Set the division strategy to be used for integer division operations. 
<var>strategy</var> can be one of:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">call-div1</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Calls a library function that uses the single-step division instruction
<code>div1</code> to perform the operation.  Division by zero calculates an
unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default except for SH4,
SH2A and SHcompact.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">call-fp</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Calls a library function that performs the operation in double precision
floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is
the default for SHcompact with FPU.  Specifying this for targets that do not
have a double precision FPU defaults to <code>call-div1</code>.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">call-table</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and
the <code>div1</code> instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division
by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default
for SH4.  Specifying this for targets that do not have dynamic shift
instructions defaults to <code>call-div1</code>.

     </dl>

     <p>When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy is
selected based on the current target.  For SH2A the default strategy is to
use the <code>divs</code> and <code>divu</code> instructions instead of library function
calls.

     <br><dt><code>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</code><dd><a name="index-maccumulate_002doutgoing_002dargs-2890"></a>Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather
than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also
needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.

     <br><dt><code>-mdivsi3_libfunc=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mdivsi3_005flibfunc_003d_0040var_007bname_007d-2891"></a>Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to
<var>name</var>. 
This only affects the name used in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">call</span></samp>&rsquo; division strategies, and
the compiler still expects the same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as
if this option were not present.

     <br><dt><code>-mfixed-range=</code><var>register-range</var><dd><a name="index-mfixed_002drange-2892"></a>Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers. 
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.

     <br><dt><code>-mbranch-cost=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mbranch_002dcost_003d_0040var_007bnum_007d-2893"></a>Assume <var>num</var> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers
make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if possible.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.46 SPARC Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-SPARC-options-2909"></a>
These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are supported on the SPARC:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mno-app-regs</code><dt><code>-mapp-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dapp_002dregs-2910"></a><a name="index-mapp_002dregs-2911"></a>Specify <samp><span class="option">-mapp-regs</span></samp> to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  Like the
global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is then treated as an
allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.

     <p>To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify <samp><span class="option">-mno-app-regs</span></samp>.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.

     <br><dt><code>-mflat</code><dt><code>-mno-flat</code><dd><a name="index-mflat-2912"></a><a name="index-mno_002dflat-2913"></a>With <samp><span class="option">-mflat</span></samp>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0&ndash;5) are still treated as &ldquo;call-saved&rdquo; registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-mno-flat</span></samp> (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.

     <br><dt><code>-mfpu</code><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dd><a name="index-mfpu-2914"></a><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-2915"></a>Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-fpu</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dfpu-2916"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-2917"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparc-*-aout</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparclite-*-*</span></samp>&rsquo; do provide software floating-point support.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <samp><span class="file">libgcc.a</span></samp>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <samp><span class="option">-msoft-float</span></samp> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-quad-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dquad_002dfloat-2918"></a>Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-quad-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dquad_002dfloat-2919"></a>Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     <p>As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the
<samp><span class="option">-msoft-quad-float</span></samp> option is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-unaligned-doubles</code><dt><code>-munaligned-doubles</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dunaligned_002ddoubles-2920"></a><a name="index-munaligned_002ddoubles-2921"></a>Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-munaligned-doubles</span></samp>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte alignment. 
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.

     <br><dt><code>-muser-mode</code><dt><code>-mno-user-mode</code><dd><a name="index-muser_002dmode-2922"></a><a name="index-mno_002duser_002dmode-2923"></a>Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.  This is relevant
only for the <code>casa</code> instruction emitted for the LEON3 processor.  This
is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mfaster-structs</code><dt><code>-mno-faster-structs</code><dd><a name="index-mfaster_002dstructs-2924"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfaster_002dstructs-2925"></a>With <samp><span class="option">-mfaster-structs</span></samp>, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
<code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many <code>ld</code> and <code>st</code> pairs. 
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC
ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the ABI.

     <br><dt><code>-mstd-struct-return</code><dt><code>-mno-std-struct-return</code><dd><a name="index-mstd_002dstruct_002dreturn-2926"></a><a name="index-mno_002dstd_002dstruct_002dreturn-2927"></a>With <samp><span class="option">-mstd-struct-return</span></samp>, the compiler generates checking code
in functions returning structures or unions to detect size mismatches
between the two sides of function calls, as per the 32-bit ABI.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-std-struct-return</span></samp>.  This option has no effect
in 64-bit mode.

     <br><dt><code>-mlra</code><dt><code>-mno-lra</code><dd><a name="index-mlra-2928"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlra-2929"></a>Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is the default for SPARC since GCC 7
so <samp><span class="option">-mno-lra</span></samp> needs to be passed to get old Reload.

<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=native</span></samp> has no effect if GCC does not recognize

     <p>By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code for the V7
variant of the SPARC architecture.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=cypress</span></samp>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older
SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=v8</span></samp>, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC
architecture.  The only difference from V7 code is that the compiler emits
the integer multiply and integer divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8
but not in SPARC-V7.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=supersparc</span></samp>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and
2000 series.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=sparclite</span></samp>, GCC generates code for the SPARClite variant of
the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, integer divide step
and scan (<code>ffs</code>) instructions which exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7. 
With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=f930</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original SPARClite, with no FPU.  With
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=f934</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu
MB86934 chip, which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=sparclet</span></samp>, GCC generates code for the SPARClet variant of
the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, multiply/accumulate,
integer divide step and scan (<code>ffs</code>) instructions which exist in SPARClet
but not in SPARC-V7.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=tsc701</span></samp>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=v9</span></samp>, GCC generates code for the V9 variant of the SPARC
architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions,
3 additional floating-point condition code registers and conditional move
instructions.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=ultrasparc</span></samp>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips.  With
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=ultrasparc3</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.  With
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=niagara</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=niagara2</span></samp>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips. With
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=niagara3</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun
UltraSPARC T3 chips.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=niagara4</span></samp>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.  With
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=niagara7</span></samp>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
Oracle SPARC M7 chips.  With <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=m8</span></samp>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for Oracle M8 chips.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.47 SPU Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-SPU-options-2964"></a>
These &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; options are supported on the SPU:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mwarn-reloc</code><dt><code>-merror-reloc</code><dd><a name="index-mwarn_002dreloc-2965"></a><a name="index-merror_002dreloc-2966"></a>
The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations.  By default, GCC
gives an error when it generates code that requires a dynamic
relocation.  <samp><span class="option">-mno-error-reloc</span></samp> disables the error,
<samp><span class="option">-mwarn-reloc</span></samp> generates a warning instead.

     <br><dt><code>-msafe-dma</code><dt><code>-munsafe-dma</code><dd><a name="index-msafe_002ddma-2967"></a><a name="index-munsafe_002ddma-2968"></a>
Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must not be
reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory that is being
accessed. 
With <samp><span class="option">-munsafe-dma</span></samp> you must use the <code>volatile</code> keyword to protect
memory accesses, but that can lead to inefficient code in places where the
memory is known to not change.  Rather than mark the memory as volatile,
you can use <samp><span class="option">-msafe-dma</span></samp> to tell the compiler to treat
the DMA instructions as potentially affecting all memory.

     <br><dt><code>-mbranch-hints</code><dd><a name="index-mbranch_002dhints-2969"></a>
By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.  A hint
is not generated closer than 8 instructions away from its branch. 
There is little reason to disable them, except for debugging purposes,
or to make an object a little bit smaller.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall-mem</code><dt><code>-mlarge-mem</code><dd><a name="index-msmall_002dmem-2970"></a><a name="index-mlarge_002dmem-2971"></a>
By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are never larger
than 18 bits.  With <samp><span class="option">-mlarge-mem</span></samp> code is generated that assumes
a full 32-bit address.

     <br><dt><code>-mstdmain</code><dd><a name="index-mstdmain-2972"></a>
By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the SPU-style
main function interface (which has an unconventional parameter list). 
With <samp><span class="option">-mstdmain</span></samp>, GCC links your program against startup
code that assumes a C99-style interface to <code>main</code>, including a
local copy of <code>argv</code> strings.

     <br><dt><code>-mfixed-range=</code><var>register-range</var><dd><a name="index-mfixed_002drange-2973"></a>Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers. 
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.

     <br><dt><code>-mea32</code><dt><code>-mea64</code><dd><a name="index-mea32-2974"></a><a name="index-mea64-2975"></a>Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space accessed
via the <code>__ea</code> named address space qualifier are either 32 or 64
bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an ABI-changing option,
all object code in an executable must be compiled with the same setting.

     <br><dt><code>-maddress-space-conversion</code><dt><code>-mno-address-space-conversion</code><dd><a name="index-maddress_002dspace_002dconversion-2976"></a><a name="index-mno_002daddress_002dspace_002dconversion-2977"></a>Allow/disallow treating the <code>__ea</code> address space as superset
of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts
between <code>__ea</code> and generic pointer as well as implicit
conversions of generic pointers to <code>__ea</code> pointers.  The
default is to allow address space pointer conversions.

     <br><dt><code>-mcache-size=</code><var>cache-size</var><dd><a name="index-mcache_002dsize-2978"></a>This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing variables
in the <code>__ea</code> address space with a particular cache size.  Possible
options for <var>cache-size</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">16</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">32</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">64</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">128</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The default cache size is 64KB.

     <br><dt><code>-matomic-updates</code><dt><code>-mno-atomic-updates</code><dd><a name="index-matomic_002dupdates-2979"></a><a name="index-mno_002datomic_002dupdates-2980"></a>This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects whether atomic updates to the software-managed
cache of PPU-side variables are used.  If you use atomic updates, changes
to a PPU variable from SPU code using the <code>__ea</code> named address space
qualifier do not interfere with changes to other PPU variables residing
in the same cache line from PPU code.  If you do not use atomic updates,
such interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines is
more efficient.  The default behavior is to use atomic updates.

     <br><dt><code>-mdual-nops</code><dt><code>-mdual-nops=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-mdual_002dnops-2981"></a>By default, GCC inserts NOPs to increase dual issue when it expects
it to increase performance.  <var>n</var> can be a value from 0 to 10.  A
smaller <var>n</var> inserts fewer NOPs.  10 is the default, 0 is the
same as <samp><span class="option">-mno-dual-nops</span></samp>.  Disabled with <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mhint-max-nops=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-mhint_002dmax_002dnops-2982"></a>Maximum number of NOPs to insert for a branch hint.  A branch hint must
be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it is affecting.  GCC
inserts up to <var>n</var> NOPs to enforce this, otherwise it does not
generate the branch hint.

     <br><dt><code>-mhint-max-distance=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-mhint_002dmax_002ddistance-2983"></a>The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be within
256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.  By default, GCC makes
sure it is within 125.

     <br><dt><code>-msafe-hints</code><dd><a name="index-msafe_002dhints-2984"></a>Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall indefinitely. 
By default, GCC inserts the <code>hbrp</code> instruction to make sure
this stall won't happen.

     <p>Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer <code>long double</code>

precision) and <samp><span class="option">-mpc80</span></samp> rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is
the default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in higher
precisions are not available to the programmer without setting the FPU
control word explicitly.

     <p>Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the default
80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that some mathematical
libraries assume that extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations
are enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer significant
loss of accuracy, typically through so-called &ldquo;catastrophic cancellation&rdquo;,
when this option is used to set the precision to less than extended precision.

option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that realigns the
run-time stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes that keep
4-byte stack alignment with modern codes that keep 16-byte stack alignment for
SSE compatibility.  See also the attribute <code>force_align_arg_pointer</code>,
applicable to individual functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mpreferred_002dstack_002dboundary-3094"></a>Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <var>num</var>
byte boundary.  If <samp><span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary</span></samp> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with
SSE extensions disabled, <samp><span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</span></samp> can be
used to keep the stack boundary aligned to 8 byte boundary.  Since
x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and
intended to be used in controlled environment where stack space is
important limitation.  This option leads to wrong code when functions
compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard
library) are called with misaligned stack.  In this case, SSE
instructions may lead to misaligned memory access traps.  In addition,
variable arguments are handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned
objects (including x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong
results.  You must build all modules with
<samp><span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</span></samp>, including any libraries.  This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.

     <br><dt><code>-mincoming-stack-boundary=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mincoming_002dstack_002dboundary-3095"></a>Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to <var>num</var> byte
boundary.  If <samp><span class="option">-mincoming-stack-boundary</span></samp> is not specified,
the one specified by <samp><span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary</span></samp> is used.

     <p>On Pentium and Pentium Pro, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code> values
should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see <samp><span class="option">-malign-double</span></samp>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type <code>__m128</code> may not work
properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.

     <p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack. 
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

     <p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to <samp><span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</span></samp>.

Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native Microsoft
Windows compiler.

     <p>If <code>packed</code> is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used,
it may be that the Microsoft ABI lays out the structure differently
than the way GCC normally does.  Particularly when moving packed
data between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler
(either via function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access
either format.

     <p>This option is enabled by default for Microsoft Windows
targets.  This behavior can also be controlled locally by use of variable
or type attributes.  For more information, see <a href="#x86-Variable-Attributes">x86 Variable Attributes</a>
and <a href="#x86-Type-Attributes">x86 Type Attributes</a>.

     <p>The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with the exception
of the bit-field packing. 
The padding and alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field
can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are
declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last member
the highest.

          <li>Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment requirement
for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either the size of the
object or the current packing size (specified with either the
<code>aligned</code> attribute or the <code>pack</code> pragma),
whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and arrays,
the alignment requirement is the largest alignment requirement of its members. 
Every object is allocated an offset so that:

          <pre class="smallexample">               offset % alignment_requirement == 0
</pre>
          <li>Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte allocation
unit if the integral types are the same size and if the next bit-field fits
into the current allocation unit without crossing the boundary imposed by the
common alignment requirements of the bit-fields.
          </ol>

     <p>MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-fields that
are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.

          <p>For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct
                {
                  unsigned long bf_1 : 12;
                  unsigned long : 0;
                  unsigned long bf_2 : 12;
                } t1;
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">The size of <code>t1</code> is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.  If the
zero-length bit-field were removed, <code>t1</code>'s size would be 4 bytes.

          <li>If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field, <code>foo</code>, and the
alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than the member that follows it,
<code>bar</code>, <code>bar</code> is aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.

          <p>For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct
                {
                  char foo : 4;
                  short : 0;
                  char bar;
                } t2;
               
               struct
                {
                  char foo : 4;
                  short : 0;
                  double bar;
                } t3;
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">For <code>t2</code>, <code>bar</code> is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1. 
Accordingly, the size of <code>t2</code> is 4.  For <code>t3</code>, the zero-length
bit-field does not affect the alignment of <code>bar</code> or, as a result, the size
of the structure.

          <p>Taking this into account, it is important to note the following:

               <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, the type of the
zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the structure as whole. For
example, <code>t2</code> has a size of 4 bytes, since the zero-length bit-field follows a
normal bit-field, and is of type short.

               <li>Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a normal bit-field, it may
still affect the alignment of the structure:

               <pre class="smallexample">                    struct
                     {
                       char foo : 6;
                       long : 0;
                     } t4;
</pre>
               <p class="noindent">Here, <code>t4</code> takes up 4 bytes.
               </ol>

          <li>Zero-length bit-fields following non-bit-field members are ignored:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct
                {
                  char foo;
                  long : 0;
                  char bar;
                } t5;
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">Here, <code>t5</code> takes up 2 bytes.

specifies that the <code>dllimport</code> attribute should be ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-mthread</code><dd><a name="index-mthread-3233"></a>This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.

     <br><dt><code>-municode</code><dd><a name="index-municode-3234"></a>This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets.  It causes
the <code>UNICODE</code> preprocessor macro to be predefined, and
chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.

     <br><dt><code>-mwin32</code><dd><a name="index-mwin32-3235"></a>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined macros are to
be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence the choice
of runtime library/startup code.

     <br><dt><code>-mwindows</code><dd><a name="index-mwindows-3236"></a>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
appropriately.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-set-stack-executable</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dset_002dstack_002dexecutable-3237"></a>This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
the executable flag for the stack used by nested functions isn't
set. This is necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of
Microsoft Windows, as there the User32 API, which is used to set executable
privileges, isn't available.

     <br><dt><code>-fwritable-relocated-rdata</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dwritable_002drelocated_002drdata-3238"></a>This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets.  It specifies
that relocated-data in read-only section is put into the <code>.data</code>
section.  This is a necessary for older runtimes not supporting
modification of <code>.rdata</code> sections for pseudo-relocation.

     <br><dt><code>-mpe-aligned-commons</code><dd><a name="index-mpe_002daligned_002dcommons-3239"></a>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that
permits the correct alignment of COMMON variables should be
used when generating code.  It is enabled by default if
GCC detects that the target assembler found during configuration
supports the feature.

<h4 class="subsection">3.18.59 Xtensa Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-Xtensa-Options-3242"></a>
These options are supported for Xtensa targets:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mconst16</code><dt><code>-mno-const16</code><dd><a name="index-mconst16-3243"></a><a name="index-mno_002dconst16-3244"></a>Enable or disable use of <code>CONST16</code> instructions for loading
constant values.  The <code>CONST16</code> instruction is currently not a
standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, <code>CONST16</code>
instructions are always used in place of the standard <code>L32R</code>
instructions.  The use of <code>CONST16</code> is enabled by default only if
the <code>L32R</code> instruction is not available.

     <br><dt><code>-mfused-madd</code><dt><code>-mno-fused-madd</code><dd><a name="index-mfused_002dmadd-3245"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfused_002dmadd-3246"></a>Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with <em>more</em> bits of
precision than specified by the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.

     <br><dt><code>-mserialize-volatile</code><dt><code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code><dd><a name="index-mserialize_002dvolatile-3247"></a><a name="index-mno_002dserialize_002dvolatile-3248"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC inserts <code>MEMW</code> instructions before
<code>volatile</code> memory references to guarantee sequential consistency. 
The default is <samp><span class="option">-mserialize-volatile</span></samp>.  Use
<samp><span class="option">-mno-serialize-volatile</span></samp> to omit the <code>MEMW</code> instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mforce-no-pic</code><dd><a name="index-mforce_002dno_002dpic-3249"></a>For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for compiling
kernel code.

     <br><dt><code>-mtext-section-literals</code><dt><code>-mno-text-section-literals</code><dd><a name="index-mtext_002dsection_002dliterals-3250"></a><a name="index-mno_002dtext_002dsection_002dliterals-3251"></a>These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mno-text-section-literals</span></samp>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With <samp><span class="option">-mtext-section-literals</span></samp>, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.  Literals for each function are placed right before that function.

     <br><dt><code>-mauto-litpools</code><dt><code>-mno-auto-litpools</code><dd><a name="index-mauto_002dlitpools-3252"></a><a name="index-mno_002dauto_002dlitpools-3253"></a>These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mno-auto-litpools</span></samp>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file unless <samp><span class="option">-mtext-section-literals</span></samp> is
used.  With <samp><span class="option">-mauto-litpools</span></samp> the literals are interspersed in
the text section by the assembler.  Compiler does not produce explicit
<code>.literal</code> directives and loads literals into registers with
<code>MOVI</code> instructions instead of <code>L32R</code> to let the assembler
do relaxation and place literals as necessary.  This option allows
assembler to create several literal pools per function and assemble
very big functions, which may not be possible with
<samp><span class="option">-mtext-section-literals</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-mtarget-align</code><dt><code>-mno-target-align</code><dd><a name="index-mtarget_002dalign-3254"></a><a name="index-mno_002dtarget_002dalign-3255"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is <samp><span class="option">-mtarget-align</span></samp>.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like <code>LOOP</code>, which the
assembler always aligns, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting NOP instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mlongcalls</code><dt><code>-mno-longcalls</code><dd><a name="index-mlongcalls-3256"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlongcalls-3257"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct <code>CALL</code>
instruction into an <code>L32R</code> followed by a <code>CALLX</code> instruction. 
The default is <samp><span class="option">-mno-longcalls</span></samp>.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by GCC still shows direct call
instructions&mdash;look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

<h3 class="section">3.19 Specifying Subprocesses and the Switches to Pass to Them</h3>

<p><a name="index-Spec-Files-3259"></a>
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <dfn>spec strings</dfn>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <samp><span class="option">-specs=</span></samp> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.

 <p><dfn>Spec files</dfn> are plain-text files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line, which can be one of the following:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%</code><var>command</var><dd>Issues a <var>command</var> to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
appear here are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>%include &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0025include_007d-3260"></a>Search for <var>file</var> and insert its text at the current point in the
specs file.

          <br><dt><code>%include_noerr &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0025include_005fnoerr_007d-3261"></a>Just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%include</span></samp>&rsquo;, but do not generate an error message if the include
file cannot be found.

          <br><dt><code>%rename </code><var>old_name</var> <var>new_name</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0025rename_007d-3262"></a>Rename the spec string <var>old_name</var> to <var>new_name</var>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>*[</code><var>spec_name</var><code>]:</code><dd>This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named spec
string.  All lines after this directive up to the next directive or
blank line are considered to be the text for the spec string.  If this
results in an empty string then the spec is deleted.  (Or, if the
spec did not exist, then nothing happens.)  Otherwise, if the spec
does not currently exist a new spec is created.  If the spec does
exist then its contents are overridden by the text of this
directive, unless the first character of that text is the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
character, in which case the text is appended to the spec.

     <br><dt><code>[</code><var>suffix</var><code>]:</code><dd>Creates a new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>suffix</var><span class="samp">] spec</span></samp>&rsquo; pair.  All lines after this directive
and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make up the
spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler encounters an
input file with the named suffix, it processes the spec string in
order to work out how to compile that file.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          .ZZ:
          z-compile -input %i
</pre>
     <p>This says that any input file whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ZZ</span></samp>&rsquo; should be
passed to the program &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z-compile</span></samp>&rsquo;, which should be invoked with the
command-line switch <samp><span class="option">-input</span></samp> and with the result of performing the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%i</span></samp>&rsquo; substitution.  (See below.)

     <p>As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text following a
suffix directive can be one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>@</code><var>language</var><dd>This says that the suffix is an alias for a known <var>language</var>.  This is
similar to using the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> command-line switch to GCC to specify a
language explicitly.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               .ZZ:
               @c++
</pre>
          <p>Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.

          <br><dt><code>#</code><var>name</var><dd>This causes an error messages saying:

          <pre class="smallexample">               <var>name</var> compiler not installed on this system.
</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it. 
This directive adds an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is effectively
possible to override earlier entries using this technique.

 </dl>

 <p>GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm          Options to pass to the assembler
     asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
     cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
     cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
     cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
     endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
     link         Options to pass to the linker
     lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
     libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
     linker       Sets the name of the linker
     predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
     signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether <code>char</code> is signed
                  by default
     startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link
</pre>
 <p>Here is a small example of a spec file:

<pre class="smallexample">     %rename lib                 old_lib
     
     *lib:
     --start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)
</pre>
 <p>This example renames the spec called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">old_lib</span></samp>&rsquo; and
then overrides the previous definition of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; with a new one. 
The new definition adds in some extra command-line options before
including the text of the old definition.

 <p><dfn>Spec strings</dfn> are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to
conditionally insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs
it is possible to generate quite complex command lines.

 <p>Here is a table of all defined &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;-sequences for spec
strings.  Note that spaces are not generated automatically around the
results of expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them
together or combine them with constant text in a single argument.

     <dl>
<dt><code>%%</code><dd>Substitute one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; into the program name or argument.

     <br><dt><code>%i</code><dd>Substitute the name of the input file being processed.

     <br><dt><code>%b</code><dd>Substitute the basename of the input file being processed. 
This is the substring up to (and not including) the last period
and not including the directory.

     <br><dt><code>%B</code><dd>This is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%b</span></samp>&rsquo;, but include the file suffix (text after
the last period).

     <br><dt><code>%d</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; as a
temporary file name, so that that file is deleted if GCC exits
successfully.  Unlike &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, this contributes no text to the
argument.

     <br><dt><code>%g</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitute a file name that has suffix <var>suffix</var> and is chosen
once per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file
name is now chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously
chosen file names are known.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s ... %g.o ... %g.s</span></samp>&rsquo;
might turn into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>suffix</var> matches
the regexp &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[.A-Za-z]*</span></samp>&rsquo; or the special string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is
treated exactly as if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; had been preprocessed.  Previously, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;
was simply substituted with a file name chosen once per compilation,
without regard to any appended suffix (which was therefore treated
just like ordinary text), making such attacks more likely to succeed.

     <br><dt><code>%u</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, but generates a new temporary file name
each time it appears instead of once per compilation.

     <br><dt><code>%U</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the last file name generated with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, generating a
new one if there is no such last file name.  In the absence of any
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, this is just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, except they don't share
the same suffix <em>space</em>, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s ... %U.s ... %g.s ... %U.s</span></samp>&rsquo;
involves the generation of two distinct file names, one
for each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g.s</span></samp>&rsquo; and another for each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%U.s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Previously, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%U</span></samp>&rsquo; was
simply substituted with a file name chosen for the previous &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span></samp>&rsquo;,
without regard to any appended suffix.

     <br><dt><code>%j</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the name of the <code>HOST_BIT_BUCKET</code>, if any, and if it is
writable, and if <samp><span class="option">-save-temps</span></samp> is not used;
otherwise, substitute the name
of a temporary file, just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This temporary file is not
meant for communication between processes, but rather as a junk
disposal mechanism.

     <br><dt><code>%|</code><var>suffix</var><dt><code>%m</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, except if <samp><span class="option">-pipe</span></samp> is in effect.  In that case
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%|</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes a single dash and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%m</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes nothing at
all.  These are the two most common ways to instruct a program that it
should read from standard input or write to standard output.  If you
need something more elaborate you can use an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{pipe:</span><code>X</code><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;
construct: see for example <samp><span class="file">f/lang-specs.h</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%.</code><var>SUFFIX</var><dd>Substitutes <var>.SUFFIX</var> for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
when it is subsequently output with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <var>SUFFIX</var> is
terminated by the next space or %.

     <br><dt><code>%w</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%w</span></samp>&rsquo; as the
designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
into the sequence of arguments that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes.

     <br><dt><code>%o</code><dd>Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces
around the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; as well or the results are undefined. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo; is for use in the specs for running the linker. 
Input files whose names have no recognized suffix are not compiled
at all, but they are included among the output files, so they are
linked.

     <br><dt><code>%O</code><dd>Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is
handled specially when it immediately follows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g, %u, or %U</span></samp>&rsquo;,
because of the need for those to form complete file names.  The
handling is such that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated exactly as if it had already
been substituted, except that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g, %u, and %U</span></samp>&rsquo; do not currently
support additional <var>suffix</var> characters following &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; as they do
following, for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%p</code><dd>Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the
current target machine.  Use this when running <samp><span class="command">cpp</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%P</code><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%p</span></samp>&rsquo;, but puts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; before and after the name of each
predefined macro, except for macros that start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; or with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span><var>L</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>L</var> is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO
C.

     <br><dt><code>%I</code><dd>Substitute any of <samp><span class="option">-iprefix</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>),
<samp><span class="option">-isysroot</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT</span></samp>),
<samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> (made from <samp><span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> options)
and <samp><span class="option">-imultilib</span></samp> as necessary.

     <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some sort. 
Search for that file in a standard list of directories and substitute
the full name found.  The current working directory is included in the
list of directories scanned.

     <br><dt><code>%T</code><dd>Current argument is the name of a linker script.  Search for that file
in the current list of directories to scan for libraries. If the file
is located insert a <samp><span class="option">--script</span></samp> option into the command line
followed by the full path name found.  If the file is not found then
generate an error message.  Note: the current working directory is not
searched.

     <br><dt><code>%e</code><var>str</var><dd>Print <var>str</var> as an error message.  <var>str</var> is terminated by a newline. 
Use this when inconsistent options are detected.

     <br><dt><code>%(</code><var>name</var><code>)</code><dd>Substitute the contents of spec string <var>name</var> at this point.

     <br><dt><code>%x{</code><var>option</var><code>}</code><dd>Accumulate an option for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%X</code><dd>Output the accumulated linker options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wl</span></samp> or a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>&rsquo;
spec string.

     <br><dt><code>%Y</code><dd>Output the accumulated assembler options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wa</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%Z</code><dd>Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by <samp><span class="option">-Wp</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%a</code><dd>Process the <code>asm</code> spec.  This is used to compute the
switches to be passed to the assembler.

     <br><dt><code>%A</code><dd>Process the <code>asm_final</code> spec.  This is a spec string for
passing switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
needed.

     <br><dt><code>%l</code><dd>Process the <code>link</code> spec.  This is the spec for computing the
command line passed to the linker.  Typically it makes use of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%L %G %S %D and %E</span></samp>&rsquo; sequences.

     <br><dt><code>%D</code><dd>Dump out a <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> option for each directory that GCC believes might
contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
current multilib directory is prepended to each of these paths.

     <br><dt><code>%L</code><dd>Process the <code>lib</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
libraries are included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%G</code><dd>Process the <code>libgcc</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
which GCC support library is included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%S</code><dd>Process the <code>startfile</code> spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
object files are the first ones passed to the linker.  Typically
this might be a file named <samp><span class="file">crt0.o</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%E</code><dd>Process the <code>endfile</code> spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
the last object files that are passed to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%C</code><dd>Process the <code>cpp</code> spec.  This is used to construct the arguments
to be passed to the C preprocessor.

     <br><dt><code>%1</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C compiler (<samp><span class="command">cc1</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>%2</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1plus</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C++ compiler (<samp><span class="command">cc1plus</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>%*</code><dd>Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below. 
Note that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by
a single space.

     <br><dt><code>%&lt;S</code><dd>Remove all occurrences of <code>-S</code> from the command line.  Note&mdash;this
command is position dependent.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; commands in the spec string
before this one see <code>-S</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; commands in the spec string
after this one do not.

     <br><dt><code>%:</code><var>function</var><code>(</code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>Call the named function <var>function</var>, passing it <var>args</var>. 
<var>args</var> is first processed as a nested spec string, then split
into an argument vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns
a string which is processed as if it had appeared literally as part
of the current spec.

     <p>The following built-in spec functions are provided:

          <dl>
<dt><code>getenv</code><dd>The <code>getenv</code> spec function takes two arguments: an environment
variable name and a string.  If the environment variable is not
defined, a fatal error is issued.  Otherwise, the return value is the
value of the environment variable concatenated with the string.  For
example, if <samp><span class="env">TOPDIR</span></samp> is defined as <samp><span class="file">/path/to/top</span></samp>, then:

          <pre class="smallexample">               %:getenv(TOPDIR /include)
</pre>
          <p>expands to <samp><span class="file">/path/to/top/include</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>if-exists</code><dd>The <code>if-exists</code> spec function takes one argument, an absolute
pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists</code> returns the
pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>if-exists-else</code><dd>The <code>if-exists-else</code> spec function is similar to the <code>if-exists</code>
spec function, except that it takes two arguments.  The first argument is
an absolute pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists-else</code>
returns the pathname.  If it does not exist, it returns the second argument. 
This way, <code>if-exists-else</code> can be used to select one file or another,
based on the existence of the first.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
               %:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>replace-outfile</code><dd>The <code>replace-outfile</code> spec function takes two arguments.  It looks for the
first argument in the outfiles array and replaces it with the second argument.  Here
is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               %{fgnu-runtime:%:replace-outfile(-lobjc -lobjc-gnu)}
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>remove-outfile</code><dd>The <code>remove-outfile</code> spec function takes one argument.  It looks for the
first argument in the outfiles array and removes it.  Here is a small example
its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               %:remove-outfile(-lm)
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>pass-through-libs</code><dd>The <code>pass-through-libs</code> spec function takes any number of arguments.  It
finds any <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> options and any non-options ending in <samp><span class="file">.a</span></samp> (which it
assumes are the names of linker input library archive files) and returns a
result containing all the found arguments each prepended by
<samp><span class="option">-plugin-opt=-pass-through=</span></samp> and joined by spaces.  This list is
intended to be passed to the LTO linker plugin.

          <pre class="smallexample">               %:pass-through-libs(%G %L %G)
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>print-asm-header</code><dd>The <code>print-asm-header</code> function takes no arguments and simply
prints a banner like:

          <pre class="smallexample">               Assembler options
               =================
               
               Use "-Wa,OPTION" to pass "OPTION" to the assembler.
</pre>
          <p>It is used to separate compiler options from assembler options
in the <samp><span class="option">--target-help</span></samp> output. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>%{S}</code><dd>Substitutes the <code>-S</code> switch, if that switch is given to GCC. 
If that switch is not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the spec
string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{foo}</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the command-line option <samp><span class="option">-foo</span></samp>
and outputs the command-line option <samp><span class="option">-foo</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>%W{S}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
deleted on failure.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*}</code><dd>Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
with <code>-S</code>, but which also take an argument.  This is used for
switches like <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, etc. 
GCC considers <samp><span class="option">-o foo</span></samp> as being
one switch whose name starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;.  %{o*} substitutes this
text, including the space.  Thus two arguments are generated.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*&amp;T*}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>*}, but preserve order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> options
(the order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> in the spec is not significant). 
There can be any number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the
wild card is optional.  Useful for CPP as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{D*&amp;U*&amp;A*}</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>%{S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if the <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp> switch is given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{!S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if the <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp> switch is <em>not</em> given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if one or more switches whose names start with
<code>-S</code> are specified to GCC.  Normally <code>X</code> is substituted only
once, no matter how many such switches appeared.  However, if <code>%*</code>
appears somewhere in <code>X</code>, then <code>X</code> is substituted once
for each matching switch, with the <code>%*</code> replaced by the part of
that switch matching the <code>*</code>.

     <p>If <code>%*</code> appears as the last part of a spec sequence then a space
is added after the end of the last substitution.  If there is more
text in the sequence, however, then a space is not generated.  This
allows the <code>%*</code> substitution to be used as part of a larger
string.  For example, a spec string like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          %{mcu=*:--script=%*/memory.ld}
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">when matching an option like <samp><span class="option">-mcu=newchip</span></samp> produces:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --script=newchip/memory.ld
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>%{.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{!.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if <em>not</em> processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{,S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if processing a file for language <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{!,S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, if not processing a file for language <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{S|P:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if either <code>-S</code> or <code>-P</code> is given to
GCC.  This may be combined with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
<code>*</code> sequences as well, although they have a stronger binding than
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If <code>%*</code> appears in <code>X</code>, all of the
alternatives must be starred, and only the first matching alternative
is substituted.

     <p>For example, a spec string like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          %{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">outputs the following command-line options from the following input
command-line options:

     <pre class="smallexample">          fred.c        -foo -baz
          jim.d         -bar -boggle
          -d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
          -d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>%{S:X; T:Y; :D}</code><dd>
If <code>S</code> is given to GCC, substitutes <code>X</code>; else if <code>T</code> is
given to GCC, substitutes <code>Y</code>; else substitutes <code>D</code>.  There can
be as many clauses as you need.  This may be combined with <code>.</code>,
<code>,</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>*</code> as needed.

 </dl>

 <p>The switch matching text <code>S</code> in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{S}</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{S:X}</span></samp>&rsquo;
or similar construct can use a backslash to ignore the special meaning
of the character following it, thus allowing literal matching of a
character that is otherwise specially treated.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{std=iso9899\:1999:X}</span></samp>&rsquo; substitutes <code>X</code> if the
<samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:1999</span></samp> option is given.

 <p>The conditional text <code>X</code> in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{S:X}</span></samp>&rsquo; or similar
construct may contain other nested &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs or spaces, or
even newlines.  They are processed as usual, as described above. 
Trailing white space in <code>X</code> is ignored.  White space may also
appear anywhere on the left side of the colon in these constructs,
except between <code>.</code> or <code>*</code> and the corresponding word.

 <p>The <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp> switches are
handled specifically in these constructs.  If another value of
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> or the negated form of a <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp> switch is found later in the command line, the earlier
switch value is ignored, except with {<code>S</code>*} where <code>S</code> is
just one letter, which passes all matching options.

 <p>The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the predicate text is used to
indicate that a command should be piped to the following command, but
only if <samp><span class="option">-pipe</span></samp> is specified.

 <p>It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not. 
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).

 <p>GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.

<h3 class="section">3.20 Environment Variables Affecting GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-3263"></a>
<!-- man begin ENVIRONMENT -->
This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.

 <p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> (see <a href="#Directory-Options">Directory Options</a>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC. 
See <a href="gccint.html#Driver">Controlling the Compilation Driver <samp><span class="file">gcc</span></samp></a>.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp><dd><!-- @itemx LC_COLLATE -->
<dt><samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp><dd><!-- @itemx LC_MONETARY -->
<!-- @itemx LC_NUMERIC -->
<!-- @itemx LC_TIME -->
<dt><samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp><dd><a name="index-LANG-3264"></a><a name="index-LC_005fCTYPE-3265"></a><!-- @findex LC_COLLATE -->
<a name="index-LC_005fMESSAGES-3266"></a><!-- @findex LC_MONETARY -->
<!-- @findex LC_NUMERIC -->
<!-- @findex LC_TIME -->
<a name="index-LC_005fALL-3267"></a><a name="index-locale-3268"></a>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information which allows GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo; for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.

     <p>The <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.

     <p>The <samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.

     <p>If the <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp>; otherwise, <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp> default to the value of the <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp><dd><a name="index-TMPDIR-3269"></a>If <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</span></samp><dd><a name="index-GCC_005fCOMPARE_005fDEBUG-3270"></a>Setting <samp><span class="env">GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</span></samp> is nearly equivalent to passing
<samp><span class="option">-fcompare-debug</span></samp> to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp><dd><a name="index-GCC_005fEXEC_005fPREFIX-3271"></a>If <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

     <p>If <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp> is not set, GCC attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.

     <p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

     <p>The default value of <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp> is
<samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib/gcc/</span></samp> where <var>prefix</var> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases <var>prefix</var> is the value
of <code>prefix</code> when you ran the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script.

     <p>Other prefixes specified with <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp> take precedence over this prefix.

     <p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as <samp><span class="file">crt0.o</span></samp> that are
used for linking.

     <p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/usr/local/lib/gcc</span></samp>&rsquo;
(more precisely, with the value of <samp><span class="env">GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</span></samp>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <samp><span class="option">-Bfoo/</span></samp>, GCC searches
<samp><span class="file">foo/bar</span></samp> just before it searches the standard directory
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/bar</span></samp>. 
If a standard directory begins with the configured
<var>prefix</var> then the value of <var>prefix</var> is replaced by
<samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp> when looking for header files.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span></samp><dd><a name="index-COMPILER_005fPATH-3272"></a>The value of <samp><span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span></samp> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the
subprograms using <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp><dd><a name="index-LIBRARY_005fPATH-3273"></a>The value of <samp><span class="env">LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it cannot find them using <samp><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span></samp>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option (but directories specified with
<samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> come first).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp><dd><a name="index-LANG-3274"></a><a name="index-locale-definition-3275"></a>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++. 
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> are recognized:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-JIS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Recognize JIS characters. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-SJIS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Recognize SJIS characters. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-EUCJP</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Recognize EUCJP characters. 
</dl>

     <p>If <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses <code>mblen</code> and <code>mbtowc</code> as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.

Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>, in which to look for header files. 
The special character, <code>PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

     <p><samp><span class="env">CPATH</span></samp> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, but after any paths given with <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

     <p>The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp>, but after any
paths given with <samp><span class="option">-isystem</span></samp> options on the command line.

     <p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the

     <p>The value of <samp><span class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</span></samp> can be just a file name, in

<h3 class="section">3.21 Using Precompiled Headers</h3>

<p><a name="index-precompiled-headers-3285"></a><a name="index-speed-of-compilation-3286"></a>
Often large projects have many header files that are included in every
source file.  The time the compiler takes to process these header files
over and over again can account for nearly all of the time required to
build the project.  To make builds faster, GCC allows you to
<dfn>precompile</dfn> a header file.

 <p>To create a precompiled header file, simply compile it as you would any
other file, if necessary using the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option to make the driver
treat it as a C or C++ header file.  You may want to use a
tool like <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to keep the precompiled header up-to-date when
the headers it contains change.

 <p>A precompiled header file is searched for when <code>#include</code> is
seen in the compilation.  As it searches for the included file
(see <a href="cpp.html#Search-Path">Search Path</a>) the
compiler looks for a precompiled header in each directory just before it
looks for the include file in that directory.  The name searched for is
the name specified in the <code>#include</code> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.gch</span></samp>&rsquo; appended.  If
the precompiled header file cannot be used, it is ignored.

 <p>For instance, if you have <code>#include "all.h"</code>, and you have
<samp><span class="file">all.h.gch</span></samp> in the same directory as <samp><span class="file">all.h</span></samp>, then the
precompiled header file is used if possible, and the original
header is used otherwise.

 <p>Alternatively, you might decide to put the precompiled header file in a
directory and use <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> to ensure that directory is searched
before (or instead of) the directory containing the original header. 
Then, if you want to check that the precompiled header file is always
used, you can put a file of the same name as the original header in this
directory containing an <code>#error</code> command.

 <p>This also works with <samp><span class="option">-include</span></samp>.  So yet another way to use
precompiled headers, good for projects not designed with precompiled
header files in mind, is to simply take most of the header files used by
a project, include them from another header file, precompile that header
file, and <samp><span class="option">-include</span></samp> the precompiled header.  If the header files
have guards against multiple inclusion, they are skipped because
they've already been included (in the precompiled header).

 <p>If you need to precompile the same header file for different
languages, targets, or compiler options, you can instead make a
<em>directory</em> named like <samp><span class="file">all.h.gch</span></samp>, and put each precompiled
header in the directory, perhaps using <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>.  It doesn't matter
what you call the files in the directory; every precompiled header in
the directory is considered.  The first precompiled header
encountered in the directory that is valid for this compilation is
used; they're searched in no particular order.

 <p>There are many other possibilities, limited only by your imagination,
good sense, and the constraints of your build system.

 <p>A precompiled header file can be used only when these conditions apply:

     <ul>
<li>Only one precompiled header can be used in a particular compilation.

     <li>A precompiled header cannot be used once the first C token is seen.  You
can have preprocessor directives before a precompiled header; you cannot
include a precompiled header from inside another header.

     <li>The precompiled header file must be produced for the same language as
the current compilation.  You cannot use a C precompiled header for a C++
compilation.

     <li>The precompiled header file must have been produced by the same compiler
binary as the current compilation is using.

     <li>Any macros defined before the precompiled header is included must
either be defined in the same way as when the precompiled header was
generated, or must not affect the precompiled header, which usually
means that they don't appear in the precompiled header at all.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> option is one way to define a macro before a
precompiled header is included; using a <code>#define</code> can also do it. 
There are also some options that define macros implicitly, like
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wdeprecated</span></samp>; the same rule applies to macros
defined this way.

     <li>If debugging information is output when using the precompiled
header, using <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> or similar, the same kind of debugging information
must have been output when building the precompiled header.  However,
a precompiled header built using <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> can be used in a compilation
when no debugging information is being output.

     <li>The same <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> options must generally be used when building
and using the precompiled header.  See <a href="#Submodel-Options">Submodel Options</a>,
for any cases where this rule is relaxed.

     <li>Each of the following options must be the same when building and using
the precompiled header:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -fexceptions
</pre>
     <li>Some other command-line options starting with <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> must be defined in the same way as when
the precompiled header was generated.  At present, it's not clear
which options are safe to change and which are not; the safest choice
is to use exactly the same options when generating and using the
precompiled header.  The following are known to be safe:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -fmessage-length=  -fpreprocessed  -fsched-interblock 
          -fsched-spec  -fsched-spec-load  -fsched-spec-load-dangerous 
          -fsched-verbose=<var>number</var>  -fschedule-insns  -fvisibility= 
          -pedantic-errors
</pre>
     </ul>

 <p>For all of these except the last, the compiler automatically
ignores the precompiled header if the conditions aren't met.  If you
find an option combination that doesn't work and doesn't cause the
precompiled header to be ignored, please consider filing a bug report,
see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.

 <p>If you do use differing options when generating and using the
precompiled header, the actual behavior is a mixture of the
behavior for the options.  For instance, if you use <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> to
generate the precompiled header but not when using it, you may or may
not get debugging information for routines in the precompiled header.

<h2 class="chapter">4 C Implementation-Defined Behavior</h2>

<p><a name="index-implementation_002ddefined-behavior_002c-C-language-3287"></a>
A conforming implementation of ISO C is required to document its
choice of behavior in each of the areas that are designated
&ldquo;implementation defined&rdquo;.  The following lists all such areas,
along with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 9899:1990, ISO/IEC
9899:1999 and ISO/IEC 9899:2011 standards.  Some areas are only
implementation-defined in one version of the standard.

 <p>Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as &ldquo;determined by ABI&rdquo; below.  See <a href="#Compatibility">Binary Compatibility</a>, and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>.  Some
choices are documented in the preprocessor manual. 
See <a href="cpp.html#Implementation_002ddefined-behavior">Implementation-defined behavior</a>.  Some choices are made by the
library and operating system (or other environment when compiling for
a freestanding environment); refer to their documentation for details.

<a href="#Explicit-Register-Variables">Explicit Register Variables</a>.

          <li>When <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp> is in use, the compiler allocates distinct stack
memory for all variables that do not have the <code>register</code>

may have a shorter lifespan than the code would indicate and may never
be placed in memory.

          <li>On some rare x86 targets, <code>setjmp</code> doesn't save the registers in
all circumstances.  In those cases, GCC doesn't allocate any variables
in registers unless they are marked <code>register</code>.

<h3 class="section">4.10 Qualifiers</h3>

     <ul>
<li><cite>What constitutes an access to an object that has volatile-qualified
type (C90 6.5.3, C99 and C11 6.7.3).</cite>

     <p>Such an object is normally accessed by pointers and used for accessing
hardware.  In most expressions, it is intuitively obvious what is a read
and what is a write.  For example

     <pre class="smallexample">          volatile int *dst = <var>somevalue</var>;
          volatile int *src = <var>someothervalue</var>;
          *dst = *src;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">will cause a read of the volatile object pointed to by <var>src</var> and store the
value into the volatile object pointed to by <var>dst</var>.  There is no
guarantee that these reads and writes are atomic, especially for objects
larger than <code>int</code>.

     <p>However, if the volatile storage is not being modified, and the value of
the volatile storage is not used, then the situation is less obvious. 
For example

     <pre class="smallexample">          volatile int *src = <var>somevalue</var>;
          *src;
</pre>
     <p>According to the C standard, such an expression is an rvalue whose type
is the unqualified version of its original type, i.e. <code>int</code>.  Whether
GCC interprets this as a read of the volatile object being pointed to or
only as a request to evaluate the expression for its side effects depends
on this type.

     <p>If it is a scalar type, or on most targets an aggregate type whose only
member object is of a scalar type, or a union type whose member objects
are of scalar types, the expression is interpreted by GCC as a read of
the volatile object; in the other cases, the expression is only evaluated
for its side effects.

<p><a name="index-implementation_002ddefined-behavior_002c-C_002b_002b-language-3292"></a>
A conforming implementation of ISO C++ is required to document its
choice of behavior in each of the areas that are designated
&ldquo;implementation defined&rdquo;.  The following lists all such areas,
along with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and ISO/IEC
14882:2003 standards.  Some areas are only implementation-defined in
one version of the standard.

 <p>Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as &ldquo;determined by ABI&rdquo; below.  See <a href="#Compatibility">Binary Compatibility</a>, and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>.  Some
choices are documented in the preprocessor manual. 
See <a href="cpp.html#Implementation_002ddefined-behavior">Implementation-defined behavior</a>.  Some choices are documented in
the corresponding document for the C language.  See <a href="#C-Implementation">C Implementation</a>.  Some choices are made by the library and operating
system (or other environment when compiling for a freestanding
environment); refer to their documentation for details.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Statements and Declarations in Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-statements-inside-expressions-3296"></a><a name="index-declarations-inside-expressions-3297"></a><a name="index-expressions-containing-statements-3298"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-statements-in-expressions-3299"></a>
<!-- the above section title wrapped and causes an underfull hbox.. i -->
<!-- changed it from "within" to "in". -mew 4feb93 -->
A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.

 <p>Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     ({ int y = foo (); int z;
        if (y &gt; 0) z = y;
        else z = - y;
        z; })
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <code>foo ()</code>.

 <p>The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <code>void</code>, and thus
effectively no value.)

 <p>This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions &ldquo;safe&rdquo; (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
&ldquo;maximum&rdquo; function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</pre>
 <p class="noindent"><a name="index-side-effects_002c-macro-argument-3300"></a>But this definition computes either <var>a</var> or <var>b</var> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here taken as <code>int</code>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define maxint(a,b) \
       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>
 <p>Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit-field, or
the initial value of a static variable.

 <p>If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <code>typeof</code> or <code>__auto_type</code> (see <a href="#Typeof">Typeof</a>).

 <p>In G++, the result value of a statement expression undergoes array and
function pointer decay, and is returned by value to the enclosing
expression.  For instance, if <code>A</code> is a class, then

<pre class="smallexample">             A a;
     
             ({a;}).Foo ()
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">constructs a temporary <code>A</code> object to hold the result of the
statement expression, and that is used to invoke <code>Foo</code>. 
Therefore the <code>this</code> pointer observed by <code>Foo</code> is not the
address of <code>a</code>.

 <p>In a statement expression, any temporaries created within a statement
are destroyed at that statement's end.  This makes statement
expressions inside macros slightly different from function calls.  In
the latter case temporaries introduced during argument evaluation are
destroyed at the end of the statement that includes the function
call.  In the statement expression case they are destroyed during
the statement expression.  For instance,

<pre class="smallexample">     #define macro(a)  ({__typeof__(a) b = (a); b + 3; })
     template&lt;typename T&gt; T function(T a) { T b = a; return b + 3; }
     
     void foo ()
     {
       macro (X ());
       function (X ());
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">has different places where temporaries are destroyed.  For the
<code>macro</code> case, the temporary <code>X</code> is destroyed just after
the initialization of <code>b</code>.  In the <code>function</code> case that
temporary is destroyed when the function returns.

 <p>These considerations mean that it is probably a bad idea to use
statement expressions of this form in header files that are designed to
work with C++.  (Note that some versions of the GNU C Library contained
header files using statement expressions that lead to precisely this
bug.)

 <p>Jumping into a statement expression with <code>goto</code> or using a
<code>switch</code> statement outside the statement expression with a
<code>case</code> or <code>default</code> label inside the statement expression is
not permitted.  Jumping into a statement expression with a computed
<code>goto</code> (see <a href="#Labels-as-Values">Labels as Values</a>) has undefined behavior. 
Jumping out of a statement expression is permitted, but if the
statement expression is part of a larger expression then it is
unspecified which other subexpressions of that expression have been
evaluated except where the language definition requires certain
subexpressions to be evaluated before or after the statement
expression.  In any case, as with a function call, the evaluation of a
statement expression is not interleaved with the evaluation of other
parts of the containing expression.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">       foo (), (({ bar1 (); goto a; 0; }) + bar2 ()), baz();
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">calls <code>foo</code> and <code>bar1</code> and does not call <code>baz</code> but
may or may not call <code>bar2</code>.  If <code>bar2</code> is called, it is
called after <code>foo</code> and before <code>bar1</code>.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Locally Declared Labels</h3>

<p><a name="index-local-labels-3301"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-local-labels-3302"></a>
GCC allows you to declare <dfn>local labels</dfn> in any nested block
scope.  A local label is just like an ordinary label, but you can
only reference it (with a <code>goto</code> statement, or by taking its
address) within the block in which it is declared.

 <p>A local label declaration looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     __label__ <var>label</var>;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="smallexample">     __label__ <var>label1</var>, <var>label2</var>, /* <span class="roman">...</span> */;
</pre>
 <p>Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the block,
before any ordinary declarations or statements.

 <p>The label declaration defines the label <em>name</em>, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with
<var>label</var><code>:</code>, within the statements of the statement expression.

 <p>The local label feature is useful for complex macros.  If a macro
contains nested loops, a <code>goto</code> can be useful for breaking out of
them.  However, an ordinary label whose scope is the whole function
cannot be used: if the macro can be expanded several times in one
function, the label is multiply defined in that function.  A
local label avoids this problem.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define SEARCH(value, array, target)              \
     do {                                              \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i &lt; max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j &lt; max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { (value) = i; goto found; }              \
       (value) = -1;                                   \
      found:;                                          \
     } while (0)
</pre>
 <p>This could also be written using a statement expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
     ({                                                \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i &lt; max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j &lt; max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { value = i; goto found; }                \
       value = -1;                                     \
      found:                                           \
       value;                                          \
     })
</pre>
 <p>Local label declarations also make the labels they declare visible to
nested functions, if there are any.  See <a href="#Nested-Functions">Nested Functions</a>, for details.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Labels as Values</h3>

<p><a name="index-labels-as-values-3303"></a><a name="index-computed-gotos-3304"></a><a name="index-goto-with-computed-label-3305"></a><a name="index-address-of-a-label-3306"></a>
You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
value has type <code>void *</code>.  This value is a constant and can be used
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     void *ptr;
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     ptr = &amp;&amp;foo;
</pre>
 <p>To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, <code>goto *</code><var>exp</var><code>;</code>.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     goto *ptr;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Any expression of type <code>void *</code> is allowed.

 <p>One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
serves as a jump table:

<pre class="smallexample">     static void *array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar, &amp;&amp;hack };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     goto *array[i];
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds&mdash;array
indexing in C never does that.

 <p>Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<code>switch</code> statement.  The <code>switch</code> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<code>switch</code> statement very well.

 <p>Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code. 
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.

 <p>You may not use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function. 
If you do that, totally unpredictable things happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.

 <p>An alternate way to write the above example is

<pre class="smallexample">     static const int array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo - &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar - &amp;&amp;foo,
                                  &amp;&amp;hack - &amp;&amp;foo };
     goto *(&amp;&amp;foo + array[i]);
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This is more friendly to code living in shared libraries, as it reduces
the number of dynamic relocations that are needed, and by consequence,
allows the data to be read-only. 
This alternative with label differences is not supported for the AVR target,
please use the first approach for AVR programs.

 <p>The <code>&amp;&amp;foo</code> expressions for the same label might have different
values if the containing function is inlined or cloned.  If a program
relies on them being always the same,
<code>__attribute__((__noinline__,__noclone__))</code> should be used to
prevent inlining and cloning.  If <code>&amp;&amp;foo</code> is used in a static
variable initializer, inlining and cloning is forbidden.

<h3 class="section">6.4 Nested Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-nested-functions-3307"></a><a name="index-downward-funargs-3308"></a><a name="index-thunks-3309"></a>
A <dfn>nested function</dfn> is a function defined inside another function. 
Nested functions are supported as an extension in GNU C, but are not
supported by GNU C++.

 <p>The nested function's name is local to the block where it is defined. 
For example, here we define a nested function named <code>square</code>, and
call it twice:

<pre class="smallexample">     foo (double a, double b)
     {
       double square (double z) { return z * z; }
     
       return square (a) + square (b);
     }
</pre>
 <p>The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called <dfn>lexical scoping</dfn>.  For example, here we show a nested
function which uses an inherited variable named <code>offset</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       int access (int *array, int index)
         { return array[index + offset]; }
       int i;
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
       for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
         /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ access (array, i) /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
 <p>Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the places
where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block, mixed
with the other declarations and statements in the block.

 <p>It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of its
name by storing its address or passing the address to another function:

<pre class="smallexample">     hack (int *array, int size)
     {
       void store (int index, int value)
         { array[index] = value; }
     
       intermediate (store, size);
     }
</pre>
 <p>Here, the function <code>intermediate</code> receives the address of
<code>store</code> as an argument.  If <code>intermediate</code> calls <code>store</code>,
the arguments given to <code>store</code> are used to store into <code>array</code>. 
But this technique works only so long as the containing function
(<code>hack</code>, in this example) does not exit.

 <p>If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function exits, all hell breaks loose.  If you try
to call it after a containing scope level exits, and if it refers
to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
safe.

 <p>GCC implements taking the address of a nested function using a technique
called <dfn>trampolines</dfn>.  This technique was described in
<cite>Lexical Closures for C++</cite> (Thomas M. Breuel, USENIX
C++ Conference Proceedings, October 17-21, 1988).

 <p>A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label is explicitly declared in the containing
function (see <a href="#Local-Labels">Local Labels</a>).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function that did the
<code>goto</code> and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {

 <p>A nested function always has no linkage.  Declaring one with

<p><a name="index-constructing-calls-3310"></a><a name="index-forwarding-calls-3311"></a>
Using the built-in functions described below, you can record
the arguments a function received, and call another function
with the same arguments, without knowing the number or types
of the arguments.

 <p>You can also record the return value of that function call,
and later return that value, without knowing what data type
the function tried to return (as long as your caller expects
that data type).

 <p>However, these built-in functions may interact badly with some
sophisticated features or other extensions of the language.  It
is, therefore, not recommended to use them outside very simple
functions acting as mere forwarders for their arguments.

<h3 class="section">6.6 Referring to a Type with <code>typeof</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-typeof-3317"></a><a name="index-sizeof-3318"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-types-of-arguments-3319"></a>
Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <code>typeof</code>. 
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <code>sizeof</code>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <code>typedef</code>.

 <p>There are two ways of writing the argument to <code>typeof</code>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     typeof (x[0](1))
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This assumes that <code>x</code> is an array of pointers to functions;
the type described is that of the values of the functions.

 <p>Here is an example with a typename as the argument:

<pre class="smallexample">     typeof (int *)
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here the type described is that of pointers to <code>int</code>.

 <p>If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ISO C
programs, write <code>__typeof__</code> instead of <code>typeof</code>. 
See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

 <p>A <code>typeof</code> construct can be used anywhere a typedef name can be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <code>sizeof</code> or <code>typeof</code>.

 <p>The operand of <code>typeof</code> is evaluated for its side effects if and
only if it is an expression of variably modified type or the name of
such a type.

 <p><code>typeof</code> is often useful in conjunction with
statement expressions (see <a href="#Statement-Exprs">Statement Exprs</a>). 
Here is how the two together can
be used to define a safe &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; macro which operates on any
arithmetic type and evaluates each of its arguments exactly once:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define max(a,b) \
       ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
           typeof (b) _b = (b); \
         _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-underscores-in-variables-in-macros-3320"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005f_007d-in-variables-in-macros-3321"></a><a name="index-local-variables-in-macros-3322"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-local_002c-in-macros-3323"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-local-variables-in-3324"></a>
The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.

<p class="noindent">Some more examples of the use of <code>typeof</code>:

     <ul>
<li>This declares <code>y</code> with the type of what <code>x</code> points to.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typeof (*x) y;
</pre>
     <li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of such values.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typeof (*x) y[4];
</pre>
     <li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of pointers to characters:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          char *y[4];
</pre>
     <p>To see the meaning of the declaration using <code>typeof</code>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, rewrite it with these macros:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
          #define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:

     <pre class="smallexample">          array (pointer (char), 4) y;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Thus, <code>array (pointer (char), 4)</code> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <code>char</code>. 
</ul>

 <p>In GNU C, but not GNU C++, you may also declare the type of a variable
as <code>__auto_type</code>.  In that case, the declaration must declare
only one variable, whose declarator must just be an identifier, the
declaration must be initialized, and the type of the variable is
determined by the initializer; the name of the variable is not in
scope until after the initializer.  (In C++, you should use C++11
<code>auto</code> for this purpose.)  Using <code>__auto_type</code>, the
&ldquo;maximum&rdquo; macro above could be written as:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define max(a,b) \
       ({ __auto_type _a = (a); \
           __auto_type _b = (b); \
         _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>
 <p>Using <code>__auto_type</code> instead of <code>typeof</code> has two advantages:

     <ul>
<li>Each argument to the macro appears only once in the expansion of
the macro.  This prevents the size of the macro expansion growing
exponentially when calls to such macros are nested inside arguments of
such macros.

     <li>If the argument to the macro has variably modified type, it is
evaluated only once when using <code>__auto_type</code>, but twice if
<code>typeof</code> is used. 
</ul>

The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.

 <p>Therefore, the expression

<pre class="smallexample">     x ? : y
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">has the value of <code>x</code> if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of
<code>y</code>.

 <p>This example is perfectly equivalent to

<pre class="smallexample">     x ? x : y
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-side-effect-in-_0040code_007b_003f_003a_007d-3330"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_003f_003a_007d-side-effect-3331"></a>In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand does,
or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then repeating
the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.  Omitting
the middle operand uses the value already computed without the undesirable
effects of recomputing it.

As an extension the integer scalar type <code>__int128</code> is supported for
targets which have an integer mode wide enough to hold 128 bits. 
Simply write <code>__int128</code> for a signed 128-bit integer, or
<code>unsigned __int128</code> for an unsigned 128-bit integer.  There is no
support in GCC for expressing an integer constant of type <code>__int128</code>

ISO C99 supports data types for integers that are at least 64 bits wide,
and as an extension GCC supports them in C90 mode and in C++. 
Simply write <code>long long int</code> for a signed integer, or
<code>unsigned long long int</code> for an unsigned integer.  To make an
integer constant of type <code>long long int</code>, add the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LL</span></samp>&rsquo;
to the integer.  To make an integer constant of type <code>unsigned long
long int</code>, add the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ULL</span></samp>&rsquo; to the integer.

 <p>You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types. 
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports a fullword-to-doubleword widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GCC.

 <p>There may be pitfalls when you use <code>long long</code> types for function
arguments without function prototypes.  If a function
expects type <code>int</code> for its argument, and you pass a value of type
<code>long long int</code>, confusion results because the caller and the
subroutine disagree about the number of bytes for the argument. 
Likewise, if the function expects <code>long long int</code> and you pass
<code>int</code>.  The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

ISO C99 supports complex floating data types, and as an extension GCC
supports them in C90 mode and in C++.  GCC also supports complex integer data
types which are not part of ISO C99.  You can declare complex types
using the keyword <code>_Complex</code>.  As an extension, the older GNU
keyword <code>__complex__</code> is also supported.

 <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_Complex double x;</span></samp>&rsquo; declares <code>x</code> as a
variable whose real part and imaginary part are both of type
<code>double</code>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_Complex short int y;</span></samp>&rsquo; declares <code>y</code> to
have real and imaginary parts of type <code>short int</code>; this is not
likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex types is
complete.

 <p>To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, <code>2.5fi</code>
has type <code>_Complex float</code> and <code>3i</code> has type
<code>_Complex int</code>.  Such a constant always has a pure imaginary
value, but you can form any complex value you like by adding one to a
real constant.  This is a GNU extension; if you have an ISO C99
conforming C library (such as the GNU C Library), and want to construct complex
constants of floating type, you should include <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and
use the macros <code>I</code> or <code>_Complex_I</code> instead.

 <p>The ISO C++14 library also defines the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix, so C++14 code
that includes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;complex&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; header cannot use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; for the
GNU extension.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix still has the GNU meaning.

 <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005freal_005f_005f_007d-keyword-3341"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fimag_005f_005f_007d-keyword-3342"></a>To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression <var>exp</var>, write
<code>__real__ </code><var>exp</var>.  Likewise, use <code>__imag__</code> to
extract the imaginary part.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>crealf</code>,
<code>creal</code>, <code>creall</code>, <code>cimagf</code>, <code>cimag</code> and
<code>cimagl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also provided as
built-in functions by GCC.

 <p><a name="index-complex-conjugation-3343"></a>The operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>conjf</code>,
<code>conj</code> and <code>conjl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also
provided as built-in functions by GCC.

 <p>GCC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice versa).  Only the DWARF
debug info format can represent this, so use of DWARF is recommended. 
If you are using the stabs debug info format, GCC describes a noncontiguous
complex variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type. 
If the variable's actual name is <code>foo</code>, the two fictitious
variables are named <code>foo$real</code> and <code>foo$imag</code>.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.

ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 defines C support for additional floating
types <code>_Float</code><var>n</var> and <code>_Float</code><var>n</var><code>x</code>, and GCC supports
these type names; the set of types supported depends on the target
architecture.  These types are not supported when compiling C++. 
Constants with these types use suffixes <code>f</code><var>n</var> or
<code>F</code><var>n</var> and <code>f</code><var>n</var><code>x</code> or <code>F</code><var>n</var><code>x</code>.  These type
names can be used together with <code>_Complex</code> to declare complex
types.

 <p>As an extension, GNU C and GNU C++ support additional floating
types, which are not supported by all targets.
     <ul>
<li><code>__float128</code> is available on i386, x86_64, IA-64, and
hppa HP-UX, as well as on PowerPC GNU/Linux targets that enable
the vector scalar (VSX) instruction set.  <code>__float128</code> supports
the 128-bit floating type.  On i386, x86_64, PowerPC, and IA-64
other than HP-UX, <code>__float128</code> is an alias for <code>_Float128</code>. 
On hppa and IA-64 HP-UX, <code>__float128</code> is an alias for <code>long
double</code>.

     <li><code>__float80</code> is available on the i386, x86_64, and IA-64
targets, and supports the 80-bit (<code>XFmode</code>) floating type.  It is
an alias for the type name <code>_Float64x</code> on these targets.

     <li><code>__ibm128</code> is available on PowerPC targets, and provides
access to the IBM extended double format which is the current format
used for <code>long double</code>.  When <code>long double</code> transitions to
<code>__float128</code> on PowerPC in the future, <code>__ibm128</code> will remain
for use in conversions between the two types. 
</ul>

 <p>Support for these additional types includes the arithmetic operators:
add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators;
relational operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from
integer and other floating types.  Use a suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>&rsquo;
in a literal constant of type <code>__float80</code> or type
<code>__ibm128</code>.  Use a suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Q</span></samp>&rsquo; for <code>_float128</code>.

 <p>In order to use <code>_Float128</code>, <code>__float128</code>, and <code>__ibm128</code>
on PowerPC Linux systems, you must use the <samp><span class="option">-mfloat128</span></samp> option. It is
expected in future versions of GCC that <code>_Float128</code> and <code>__float128</code>
will be enabled automatically.

 <p>The <code>_Float128</code> type is supported on all systems where
<code>__float128</code> is supported or where <code>long double</code> has the
IEEE binary128 format.  The <code>_Float64x</code> type is supported on all
systems where <code>__float128</code> is supported.  The <code>_Float32</code>
type is supported on all systems supporting IEEE binary32; the
<code>_Float64</code> and <code>_Float32x</code> types are supported on all systems
supporting IEEE binary64.  The <code>_Float16</code> type is supported on AArch64
systems by default, and on ARM systems when the IEEE format for 16-bit
floating-point types is selected with <samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format=ieee</span></samp>. 
GCC does not currently support <code>_Float128x</code> on any systems.

 <p>On the i386, x86_64, IA-64, and HP-UX targets, you can declare complex
types using the corresponding internal complex type, <code>XCmode</code> for
<code>__float80</code> type and <code>TCmode</code> for <code>__float128</code> type:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(TC))) _Complex128;
     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(XC))) _Complex80;
</pre>
 <p>On the PowerPC Linux VSX targets, you can declare complex types using
the corresponding internal complex type, <code>KCmode</code> for
<code>__float128</code> type and <code>ICmode</code> for <code>__ibm128</code> type:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(KC))) _Complex_float128;
     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(IC))) _Complex_ibm128;
</pre>

<h3 class="section">6.12 Half-Precision Floating Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-half_002dprecision-floating-point-3354"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005ffp16_007d-data-type-3355"></a>
On ARM and AArch64 targets, GCC supports half-precision (16-bit) floating
point via the <code>__fp16</code> type defined in the ARM C Language Extensions. 
On ARM systems, you must enable this type explicitly with the
<samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format</span></samp> command-line option in order to use it.

 <p>ARM targets support two incompatible representations for half-precision
floating-point values.  You must choose one of the representations and
use it consistently in your program.

 <p>Specifying <samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format=ieee</span></samp> selects the IEEE 754-2008 format. 
This format can represent normalized values in the range of 2^-14 to 65504. 
There are 11 bits of significand precision, approximately 3
decimal digits.

 <p>Specifying <samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format=alternative</span></samp> selects the ARM
alternative format.  This representation is similar to the IEEE
format, but does not support infinities or NaNs.  Instead, the range
of exponents is extended, so that this format can represent normalized
values in the range of 2^-14 to 131008.

 <p>The GCC port for AArch64 only supports the IEEE 754-2008 format, and does
not require use of the <samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format</span></samp> command-line option.

 <p>The <code>__fp16</code> type may only be used as an argument to intrinsics defined
in <code>&lt;arm_fp16.h&gt;</code>, or as a storage format.  For purposes of
arithmetic and other operations, <code>__fp16</code> values in C or C++
expressions are automatically promoted to <code>float</code>.

 <p>The ARM target provides hardware support for conversions between
<code>__fp16</code> and <code>float</code> values
as an extension to VFP and NEON (Advanced SIMD), and from ARMv8-A provides
hardware support for conversions between <code>__fp16</code> and <code>double</code>
values.  GCC generates code using these hardware instructions if you
compile with options to select an FPU that provides them;
for example, <samp><span class="option">-mfpu=neon-fp16 -mfloat-abi=softfp</span></samp>,
in addition to the <samp><span class="option">-mfp16-format</span></samp> option to select
a half-precision format.

 <p>Language-level support for the <code>__fp16</code> data type is
independent of whether GCC generates code using hardware floating-point
instructions.  In cases where hardware support is not specified, GCC
implements conversions between <code>__fp16</code> and other types as library
calls.

 <p>It is recommended that portable code use the <code>_Float16</code> type defined
by ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.  See <a href="#Floating-Types">Floating Types</a>.

As an extension, GNU C supports decimal floating types as
defined in the N1312 draft of ISO/IEC WDTR24732.  Support for decimal
floating types in GCC will evolve as the draft technical report changes. 
Calling conventions for any target might also change.  Not all targets
support decimal floating types.

 <p>The decimal floating types are <code>_Decimal32</code>, <code>_Decimal64</code>, and
<code>_Decimal128</code>.  They use a radix of ten, unlike the floating types
<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code> whose radix is not
specified by the C standard but is usually two.

 <p>Support for decimal floating types includes the arithmetic operators
add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators;
relational operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from
integer and other floating types.  Use a suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">df</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DF</span></samp>&rsquo; in a literal constant of type <code>_Decimal32</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dd</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DD</span></samp>&rsquo; for <code>_Decimal64</code>, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dl</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DL</span></samp>&rsquo; for
<code>_Decimal128</code>.

 <p>GCC support of decimal float as specified by the draft technical report
is incomplete:

     <ul>
<li>When the value of a decimal floating type cannot be represented in the
integer type to which it is being converted, the result is undefined
rather than the result value specified by the draft technical report.

     <li>GCC does not provide the C library functionality associated with
<samp><span class="file">math.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">fenv.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">stdlib.h</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">wchar.h</span></samp>, which must come from a separate C library implementation. 
Because of this the GNU C compiler does not define macro
<code>__STDC_DEC_FP__</code> to indicate that the implementation conforms to
the technical report. 
</ul>

 <p>Types <code>_Decimal32</code>, <code>_Decimal64</code>, and <code>_Decimal128</code>
are supported by the DWARF debug information format.

<h3 class="section">6.14 Hex Floats</h3>

<p><a name="index-hex-floats-3366"></a>
ISO C99 supports floating-point numbers written not only in the usual
decimal notation, such as <code>1.55e1</code>, but also numbers such as
<code>0x1.fp3</code> written in hexadecimal format.  As a GNU extension, GCC
supports this in C90 mode (except in some cases when strictly
conforming) and in C++.  In that format the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>&rsquo; hex introducer and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>&rsquo; exponent field are
mandatory.  The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of
2 by which the significant part is multiplied.  Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x1.f</span></samp>&rsquo; is
1 15/16,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p3</span></samp>&rsquo; multiplies it by 8, and the value of <code>0x1.fp3</code>
is the same as <code>1.55e1</code>.

 <p>Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent
is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the compiler
would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., <code>0x1.f</code>.  This
could mean <code>1.0f</code> or <code>1.9375</code> since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; is also the
extension for floating-point constants of type <code>float</code>.

As an extension, GNU C supports named address spaces as
defined in the N1275 draft of ISO/IEC DTR 18037.  Support for named
address spaces in GCC will evolve as the draft technical report
changes.  Calling conventions for any target might also change.  At

<h4 class="subsection">6.16.1 AVR Named Address Spaces</h4>

<p>On the AVR target, there are several address spaces that can be used
in order to put read-only data into the flash memory and access that
data by means of the special instructions <code>LPM</code> or <code>ELPM</code>
needed to read from flash.

 <p>Devices belonging to <code>avrtiny</code> and <code>avrxmega3</code> can access
flash memory by means of <code>LD*</code> instructions because the flash
memory is mapped into the RAM address space.  There is <em>no need</em>
for language extensions like <code>__flash</code> or attribute
<a href="#AVR-Variable-Attributes"><code>progmem</code></a>. 
The default linker description files for these devices cater for that
feature and <code>.rodata</code> stays in flash: The compiler just generates
<code>LD*</code> instructions, and the linker script adds core specific
offsets to all <code>.rodata</code> symbols: <code>0x4000</code> in the case of
<code>avrtiny</code> and <code>0x8000</code> in the case of <code>avrxmega3</code>. 
See <a href="#AVR-Options">AVR Options</a> for a list of respective devices.

 <p>For devices not in <code>avrtiny</code> or <code>avrxmega3</code>,
any data including read-only data is located in RAM (the generic
address space) because flash memory is not visible in the RAM address
space.  In order to locate read-only data in flash memory <em>and</em>
to generate the right instructions to access this data without
using (inline) assembler code, special address spaces are needed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>__flash</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fflash_007d-AVR-Named-Address-Spaces-3404"></a>The <code>__flash</code> qualifier locates data in the
<code>.progmem.data</code> section. Data is read using the <code>LPM</code>
instruction. Pointers to this address space are 16 bits wide.

<code>.progmem</code><var>N</var><code>.data</code> where <var>N</var> refers to
address space <code>__flash</code><var>N</var>. 
The compiler sets the <code>RAMPZ</code> segment register appropriately
before reading data by means of the <code>ELPM</code> instruction.

     <br><dt><code>__memx</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fmemx_007d-AVR-Named-Address-Spaces-3410"></a>This is a 24-bit address space that linearizes flash and RAM:
If the high bit of the address is set, data is read from
RAM using the lower two bytes as RAM address. 
If the high bit of the address is clear, data is read from flash
with <code>RAMPZ</code> set according to the high byte of the address. 
See <a href="#AVR-Built_002din-Functions"><code>__builtin_avr_flash_segment</code></a>.

     <p>Objects in this address space are located in <code>.progmemx.data</code>.

 <p><b>Example</b>

<pre class="smallexample">     char my_read (const __flash char ** p)
     {
         /* p is a pointer to RAM that points to a pointer to flash.
            The first indirection of p reads that flash pointer
            from RAM and the second indirection reads a char from this
            flash address.  */
     
         return **p;
     }
     
     /* Locate array[] in flash memory */
     const __flash int array[] = { 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };
     
     int i = 1;
     
     int main (void)
     {
        /* Return 17 by reading from flash memory */
        return array[array[i]];
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">For each named address space supported by avr-gcc there is an equally
named but uppercase built-in macro defined. 
The purpose is to facilitate testing if respective address space
support is available or not:

<pre class="smallexample">     #ifdef __FLASH
     const __flash int var = 1;
     
     int read_var (void)
     {
         return var;
     }
     #else
     #include &lt;avr/pgmspace.h&gt; /* From AVR-LibC */
     
     const int var PROGMEM = 1;
     
     int read_var (void)
     {
         return (int) pgm_read_word (&amp;var);
     }
     #endif /* __FLASH */
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Notice that attribute <a href="#AVR-Variable-Attributes"><code>progmem</code></a>
locates data in flash but
accesses to these data read from generic address space, i.e. 
from RAM,
so that you need special accessors like <code>pgm_read_byte</code>
from <a href="http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/">AVR-LibC</a><!-- /@w -->
together with attribute <code>progmem</code>.

<p class="noindent"><b>Limitations and caveats</b>

     <ul>
<li>Reading across the 64&nbsp;KiB section boundary of
the <code>__flash</code> or <code>__flash</code><var>N</var> address spaces
shows undefined behavior. The only address space that
supports reading across the 64&nbsp;KiB flash segment boundaries is
<code>__memx</code>.

     <li>If you use one of the <code>__flash</code><var>N</var> address spaces
you must arrange your linker script to locate the
<code>.progmem</code><var>N</var><code>.data</code> sections according to your needs.

     <li>Any data or pointers to the non-generic address spaces must
be qualified as <code>const</code>, i.e. as read-only data. 
This still applies if the data in one of these address
spaces like software version number or calibration lookup table are intended to
be changed after load time by, say, a boot loader. In this case
the right qualification is <code>const</code> <code>volatile</code> so that the compiler
must not optimize away known values or insert them
as immediates into operands of instructions.

     <li>The following code initializes a variable <code>pfoo</code>
located in static storage with a 24-bit address:
     <pre class="smallexample">          extern const __memx char foo;
          const __memx void *pfoo = &amp;foo;
</pre>
     <li>On the reduced Tiny devices like ATtiny40, no address spaces are supported. 
Just use vanilla C / C++ code without overhead as outlined above. 
Attribute <code>progmem</code> is supported but works differently,
see <a href="#AVR-Variable-Attributes">AVR Variable Attributes</a>.

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005ffar_007d-M32C-Named-Address-Spaces-3411"></a>
On the M32C target, with the R8C and M16C CPU variants, variables
qualified with <code>__far</code> are accessed using 32-bit addresses in
order to access memory beyond the first 64&nbsp;Ki bytes.  If
<code>__far</code> is used with the M32CM or M32C CPU variants, it has no
effect.

<h4 class="subsection">6.16.3 RL78 Named Address Spaces</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005ffar_007d-RL78-Named-Address-Spaces-3412"></a>
On the RL78 target, variables qualified with <code>__far</code> are accessed
with 32-bit pointers (20-bit addresses) rather than the default 16-bit
addresses.  Non-far variables are assumed to appear in the topmost
64&nbsp;KiB of the address space.

<h4 class="subsection">6.16.4 SPU Named Address Spaces</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fea_007d-SPU-Named-Address-Spaces-3413"></a>
On the SPU target variables may be declared as
belonging to another address space by qualifying the type with the
<code>__ea</code> address space identifier:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern int __ea i;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">The compiler generates special code to access the variable <code>i</code>. 
It may use runtime library
support, or generate special machine instructions to access that address
space.

<h4 class="subsection">6.16.5 x86 Named Address Spaces</h4>

<p><a name="index-x86-named-address-spaces-3414"></a>
On the x86 target, variables may be declared as being relative

     <p>The respective segment base must be set via some method specific to
the operating system.  Rather than require an expensive system call
to retrieve the segment base, these address spaces are not considered
to be subspaces of the generic (flat) address space.  This means that
explicit casts are required to convert pointers between these address
spaces and the generic address space.  In practice the application
should cast to <code>uintptr_t</code> and apply the segment base offset
that it installed previously.

     <p>The preprocessor symbols <code>__SEG_FS</code> and <code>__SEG_GS</code> are
defined when these address spaces are supported.

<h3 class="section">6.17 Arrays of Length Zero</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays-of-length-zero-3417"></a><a name="index-zero_002dlength-arrays-3418"></a><a name="index-length_002dzero-arrays-3419"></a><a name="index-flexible-array-members-3420"></a>
Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the
last element of a structure that is really a header for a variable-length
object:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct line {
       int length;
       char contents[0];
     };
     
     struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
       malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
     thisline-&gt;length = this_length;
</pre>
 <p>In ISO C90, you would have to give <code>contents</code> a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to <code>malloc</code>.

 <p>In ISO C99, you would use a <dfn>flexible array member</dfn>, which is
slightly different in syntax and semantics:

     <ul>
<li>Flexible array members are written as <code>contents[]</code> without
the <code>0</code>.

     <li>Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the <code>sizeof</code>
operator may not be applied.  As a quirk of the original implementation
of zero-length arrays, <code>sizeof</code> evaluates to zero.

     <li>Flexible array members may only appear as the last member of a
<code>struct</code> that is otherwise non-empty.

     <li>A structure containing a flexible array member, or a union containing
such a structure (possibly recursively), may not be a member of a
structure or an element of an array.  (However, these uses are
permitted by GCC as extensions.) 
</ul>

 <p>Non-empty initialization of zero-length
arrays is treated like any case where there are more initializer
elements than the array holds, in that a suitable warning about &ldquo;excess
elements in array&rdquo; is given, and the excess elements (all of them, in
this case) are ignored.

 <p>GCC allows static initialization of flexible array members. 
This is equivalent to defining a new structure containing the original
structure followed by an array of sufficient size to contain the data. 
E.g. in the following, <code>f1</code> is constructed as if it were declared
like <code>f2</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     struct f1 {
       int x; int y[];
     } f1 = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };
     
     struct f2 {
       struct f1 f1; int data[3];
     } f2 = { { 1 }, { 2, 3, 4 } };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">The convenience of this extension is that <code>f1</code> has the desired
type, eliminating the need to consistently refer to <code>f2.f1</code>.

 <p>This has symmetry with normal static arrays, in that an array of
unknown size is also written with <code>[]</code>.

 <p>Of course, this extension only makes sense if the extra data comes at
the end of a top-level object, as otherwise we would be overwriting
data at subsequent offsets.  To avoid undue complication and confusion
with initialization of deeply nested arrays, we simply disallow any
non-empty initialization except when the structure is the top-level
object.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct foo { int x; int y[]; };
     struct bar { struct foo z; };
     
     struct foo a = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };        // <span class="roman">Valid.</span>
     struct bar b = { { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } } };    // <span class="roman">Invalid.</span>
     struct bar c = { { 1, { } } };            // <span class="roman">Valid.</span>
     struct foo d[1] = { { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } } };  // <span class="roman">Invalid.</span>

Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an
extension GCC accepts them in C90 mode and in C++.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the block scope containing the declaration
exits.  For
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     FILE *
     concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
     {
       char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
       strcpy (str, s1);
       strcat (str, s2);
       return fopen (str, mode);
     }
</pre>

storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.

 <p><a name="index-variable_002dlength-array-in-a-structure-3429"></a>As an extension, GCC accepts variable-length arrays as a member of
a structure or a union.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     void
     foo (int n)
     {
       struct S { int x[n]; };
     }
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balloca_007d-vs-variable_002dlength-arrays-3430"></a>You can use the function <code>alloca</code> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <code>alloca</code> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.

 <p>There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <code>alloca</code> exists until the containing <em>function</em> returns. 
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends, unless you also use <code>alloca</code> in this scope.

 <p>You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct entry
     tester (int len, char data[len][len])
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
 <p>The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<code>sizeof</code>.

 <p>If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list&mdash;another GNU extension.

<pre class="smallexample">     struct entry
     tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-parameter-forward-declaration-3431"></a>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int len</span></samp>&rsquo; before the semicolon is a <dfn>parameter forward
declaration</dfn>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <code>len</code>
known when the declaration of <code>data</code> is parsed.

 <p>You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
declaration in parameter name and data type.  ISO C99 does not support
parameter forward declarations.

<h3 class="section">6.20 Macros with a Variable Number of Arguments.</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-number-of-arguments-3432"></a><a name="index-macro-with-variable-arguments-3433"></a><a name="index-rest-argument-_0028in-macro_0029-3434"></a><a name="index-variadic-macros-3435"></a>
In the ISO C standard of 1999, a macro can be declared to accept a
variable number of arguments much as a function can.  The syntax for
defining the macro is similar to that of a function.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; is a <dfn>variable argument</dfn>.  In the invocation of
such a macro, it represents the zero or more tokens until the closing
parenthesis that ends the invocation, including any commas.  This set of
tokens replaces the identifier <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> in the macro body
wherever it appears.  See the CPP manual for more information.

 <p>GCC has long supported variadic macros, and used a different syntax that
allowed you to give a name to the variable arguments just like any other
argument.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define debug(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format, args)
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This is in all ways equivalent to the ISO C example above, but arguably
more readable and descriptive.

 <p>GNU CPP has two further variadic macro extensions, and permits them to
be used with either of the above forms of macro definition.

 <p>In standard C, you are not allowed to leave the variable argument out
entirely; but you are allowed to pass an empty argument.  For example,
this invocation is invalid in ISO C, because there is no comma after
the string:

<pre class="smallexample">     debug ("A message")
</pre>
 <p>GNU CPP permits you to completely omit the variable arguments in this
way.  In the above examples, the compiler would complain, though since
the expansion of the macro still has the extra comma after the format
string.

 <p>To help solve this problem, CPP behaves specially for variable arguments
used with the token paste operator, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">##</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If instead you write

<pre class="smallexample">     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ## __VA_ARGS__)
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">and if the variable arguments are omitted or empty, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">##</span></samp>&rsquo;
operator causes the preprocessor to remove the comma before it.  If you
do provide some variable arguments in your macro invocation, GNU CPP
does not complain about the paste operation and instead places the
variable arguments after the comma.  Just like any other pasted macro
argument, these arguments are not macro expanded.

<p><a name="index-escaped-newlines-3436"></a><a name="index-newlines-_0028escaped_0029-3437"></a>
The preprocessor treatment of escaped newlines is more relaxed
than that specified by the C90 standard, which requires the newline
to immediately follow a backslash. 
GCC's implementation allows whitespace in the form
of spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the
backslash and the subsequent newline.  The preprocessor issues a
warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two
lines to form a single logical line.  This works within comments and
tokens, as well as between tokens.  Comments are <em>not</em> treated as
whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not
yet been replaced with spaces.

<a name="index-subscripting-and-function-values-3440"></a>In ISO C99, arrays that are not lvalues still decay to pointers, and
may be subscripted, although they may not be modified or used after

applied to them.  As an extension, GNU C allows such arrays to be
subscripted in C90 mode, though otherwise they do not decay to
pointers outside C99 mode.  For example,
this is valid in GNU C though not valid in C90:

In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on pointers to
<code>void</code> and on pointers to functions.  This is done by treating the
size of a <code>void</code> or of a function as 1.

<p><a name="index-pointers-to-arrays-3446"></a><a name="index-const-qualifier-3447"></a>
In GNU C, pointers to arrays with qualifiers work similar to pointers
to other qualified types. For example, a value of type <code>int (*)[5]</code>
can be used to initialize a variable of type <code>const int (*)[5]</code>. 
These types are incompatible in ISO C because the <code>const</code> qualifier
is formally attached to the element type of the array and not the
array itself.

As in standard C++ and ISO C99, the elements of an aggregate initializer for an

Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying elements:

<h3 class="section">6.26 Compound Literals</h3>

<p><a name="index-constructor-expressions-3450"></a><a name="index-initializations-in-expressions-3451"></a><a name="index-structures_002c-constructor-expression-3452"></a><a name="index-expressions_002c-constructor-3453"></a><a name="index-compound-literals-3454"></a><!-- The GNU C name for what C99 calls compound literals was "constructor expressions". -->

 <p>A compound literal looks like a cast of a brace-enclosed aggregate
initializer list.  Its value is an object of the type specified in
the cast, containing the elements specified in the initializer. 
Unlike the result of a cast, a compound literal is an lvalue.  ISO
C99 and later support compound literals.  As an extension, GCC
supports compound literals also in C90 mode and in C++, although
as explained below, the C++ semantics are somewhat different.

 <p>Usually, the specified type of a compound literal is a structure.  Assume
that <code>struct foo</code> and <code>structure</code> are declared as shown:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here is an example of constructing a <code>struct foo</code> with a compound literal:

<pre class="smallexample">     structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This is equivalent to writing the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     {
       struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
       structure = temp;
     }
</pre>
 <p>You can also construct an array, though this is dangerous in C++, as
explained below.  If all the elements of the compound literal are
(made up of) simple constant expressions suitable for use in
initializers of objects of static storage duration, then the compound
literal can be coerced to a pointer to its first element and used in
such an initializer, as shown here:

<pre class="smallexample">     char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
</pre>
 <p>Compound literals for scalar types and union types are also allowed.  In
the following example the variable <code>i</code> is initialized to the value
<code>2</code>, the result of incrementing the unnamed object created by
the compound literal.

<pre class="smallexample">     int i = ++(int) { 1 };
</pre>
 <p>As a GNU extension, GCC allows initialization of objects with static storage
duration by compound literals (which is not possible in ISO C99 because
the initializer is not a constant). 
It is handled as if the object were initialized only with the brace-enclosed
list if the types of the compound literal and the object match. 
The elements of the compound literal must be constant. 
If the object being initialized has array type of unknown size, the size is
determined by the size of the compound literal.

<pre class="smallexample">     static struct foo x = (struct foo) {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = (int []) {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = (int [3]) {1};
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">The above lines are equivalent to the following:
<pre class="smallexample">     static struct foo x = {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = {1, 0, 0};
</pre>
 <p>In C, a compound literal designates an unnamed object with static or
automatic storage duration.  In C++, a compound literal designates a
temporary object that only lives until the end of its full-expression. 
As a result, well-defined C code that takes the address of a subobject
of a compound literal can be undefined in C++, so G++ rejects
the conversion of a temporary array to a pointer.  For instance, if
the array compound literal example above appeared inside a function,
any subsequent use of <code>foo</code> in C++ would have undefined behavior
because the lifetime of the array ends after the declaration of <code>foo</code>.

 <p>As an optimization, G++ sometimes gives array compound literals longer
lifetimes: when the array either appears outside a function or has
a <code>const</code>-qualified type.  If <code>foo</code> and its initializer had
elements of type <code>char *const</code> rather than <code>char *</code>, or if
<code>foo</code> were a global variable, the array would have static storage
duration.  But it is probably safest just to avoid the use of array
compound literals in C++ code.

<h3 class="section">6.27 Designated Initializers</h3>

<p><a name="index-initializers-with-labeled-elements-3455"></a><a name="index-labeled-elements-in-initializers-3456"></a><a name="index-case-labels-in-initializers-3457"></a><a name="index-designated-initializers-3458"></a>
Standard C90 requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a fixed
order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or structure
being initialized.

 <p>In ISO C99 you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to, and GNU C allows this as
an extension in C90 mode as well.  This extension is not
implemented in GNU C++.

 <p>To specify an array index, write
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">] =</span></samp>&rsquo; before the element value.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="smallexample">     int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.

 <p>An alternative syntax for this that has been obsolete since GCC 2.5 but
GCC still accepts is to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; before the element
value, with no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;.

 <p>To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>first</var><span class="samp"> ... </span><var>last</var><span class="samp">] = </span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This is a GNU
extension.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">If the value in it has side effects, the side effects happen only once,
not for each initialized field by the range initializer.

<p class="noindent">Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified
plus one.

 <p>In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var><span class="samp"> =</span></samp>&rsquo; before the element value.  For example,
given the following structure,

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point { int x, y; };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">the following initialization

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
</pre>
 <p>Another syntax that has the same meaning, obsolete since GCC 2.5, is
&lsquo;<samp><var>fieldname</var><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;, as shown here:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
</pre>
 <p>Omitted field members are implicitly initialized the same as objects
that have static storage duration.

 <p><a name="index-designators-3459"></a>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var></samp>&rsquo; is known as a
<dfn>designator</dfn>.  You can also use a designator (or the obsolete colon
syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which element of the union
should be used.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     union foo { int i; double d; };
     
     union foo f = { .d = 4 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">converts 4 to a <code>double</code> to store it in the union using
the second element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type <code>union foo</code>
stores it into the union as the integer <code>i</code>, since it is
an integer.  See <a href="#Cast-to-Union">Cast to Union</a>.

 <p>You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a designator applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="smallexample">     int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
</pre>
 <p>Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an <code>enum</code> type. 
For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     int whitespace[256]
       = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
           ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-designator-lists-3460"></a>You can also write a series of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; designators before an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify a
nested subobject to initialize; the list is taken relative to the
subobject corresponding to the closest surrounding brace pair.  For
example, with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct point</span></samp>&rsquo; declaration above:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point ptarray[10] = { [2].y = yv2, [2].x = xv2, [0].x = xv0 };
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">If the same field is initialized multiple times, it has the value from
the last initialization.  If any such overridden initialization has
side effect, it is unspecified whether the side effect happens or not. 
Currently, GCC discards them and issues a warning.

<h3 class="section">6.28 Case Ranges</h3>

<p><a name="index-case-ranges-3461"></a><a name="index-ranges-in-case-statements-3462"></a>
You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single <code>case</code> label,
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     case <var>low</var> ... <var>high</var>:
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This has the same effect as the proper number of individual <code>case</code>
labels, one for each integer value from <var>low</var> to <var>high</var>, inclusive.

 <p>This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:

<pre class="smallexample">     case 'A' ... 'Z':
</pre>
 <p><strong>Be careful:</strong> Write spaces around the <code>...</code>, for otherwise
it may be parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example,
write this:

<pre class="smallexample">     case 1 ... 5:
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">rather than this:

<pre class="smallexample">     case 1...5:

<h3 class="section">6.29 Cast to a Union Type</h3>

<p><a name="index-cast-to-a-union-3463"></a><a name="index-union_002c-casting-to-a-3464"></a>
A cast to union type looks similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with the
<code>union</code> keyword or with a <code>typedef</code> name that refers to
a union.  A cast to a union actually creates a compound literal and
yields an lvalue, not an rvalue like true casts do. 
See <a href="#Compound-Literals">Compound Literals</a>.

 <p>The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:

<pre class="smallexample">     union foo { int i; double d; };
     int x;
     double y;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can be cast to type <code>union foo</code>.

 <p>Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:

<pre class="smallexample">     union foo u;
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
     u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
</pre>
 <p>You can also use the union cast as a function argument:

<pre class="smallexample">     void hack (union foo);
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     hack ((union foo) x);
</pre>

ISO C99 and ISO C++ allow declarations and code to be freely mixed
within compound statements.  As an extension, GNU C also allows this in
C90 mode.  For example, you could do:

     i++;

In GNU C, you can use function attributes to declare certain things
about functions called in your program which help the compiler
optimize calls and check your code more carefully.  For example, you
can use attributes to declare that a function never returns
(<code>noreturn</code>), returns a value depending only on its arguments
(<code>pure</code>), or has <code>printf</code>-style arguments (<code>format</code>).

 <p>You can also use attributes to control memory placement, code
generation options or call/return conventions within the function
being annotated.  Many of these attributes are target-specific.  For
example, many targets support attributes for defining interrupt
handler functions, which typically must follow special register usage
and return conventions.

 <p>Function attributes are introduced by the <code>__attribute__</code> keyword
on a declaration, followed by an attribute specification inside double
parentheses.  You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by
separating them by commas within the double parentheses or by
immediately following an attribute declaration with another attribute
declaration.  See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for the exact rules on attribute
syntax and placement.  Compatible attribute specifications on distinct
declarations of the same function are merged.  An attribute specification
that is not compatible with attributes already applied to a declaration
of the same function is ignored with a warning.

 <p>GCC also supports attributes on
variable declarations (see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>),
labels (see <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>),
enumerators (see <a href="#Enumerator-Attributes">Enumerator Attributes</a>),
statements (see <a href="#Statement-Attributes">Statement Attributes</a>),
and types (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

 <p>There is some overlap between the purposes of attributes and pragmas
(see <a href="#Pragmas">Pragmas Accepted by GCC</a>).  It has been
found convenient to use <code>__attribute__</code> to achieve a natural
attachment of attributes to their corresponding declarations, whereas
<code>#pragma</code> is of use for compatibility with other compilers
or constructs that do not naturally form part of the grammar.

 <p>In addition to the attributes documented here,
GCC plugins may provide their own attributes.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.1 Common Function Attributes</h4>

<p>The following attributes are supported on most targets.

     <dl>
<!-- Keep this table alphabetized by attribute name.  Treat _ as space. -->

     <dt><code>alias ("</code><var>target</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balias_007d-function-attribute-3472"></a>The <code>alias</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">defines &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; to be a weak alias for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__f</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.  It is an error if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__f</span></samp>&rsquo;
is not defined in the same translation unit.

     <p>This attribute requires assembler and object file support,
and may not be available on all targets.

     <br><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007baligned_007d-function-attribute-3473"></a>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the function,
measured in bytes.

     <p>You cannot use this attribute to decrease the alignment of a function,
only to increase it.  However, when you explicitly specify a function
alignment this overrides the effect of the
<samp><span class="option">-falign-functions</span></samp> (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>) option for this
function.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be
limited by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
linker is only able to arrange for functions to be aligned up to a
certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported
alignment may be very very small.)  See your linker documentation for
further information.

     <p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can also be used for variables and fields
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>alloc_align</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balloc_005falign_007d-function-attribute-3474"></a>The <code>alloc_align</code> attribute is used to tell the compiler that the
function return value points to memory, where the returned pointer minimum
alignment is given by one of the functions parameters.  GCC uses this
information to improve pointer alignment analysis.

     <p>The function parameter denoting the allocated alignment is specified by
one integer argument, whose number is the argument of the attribute. 
Argument numbering starts at one.

     <p>For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void* my_memalign(size_t, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_align(1)))
</pre>

For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function
independent of any restrictions that otherwise apply to inlining. 
Failure to inline such a function is diagnosed as an error. 
Note that if such a function is called indirectly the compiler may

If the attribute has two arguments, the second argument is misalignment offset.

the function is unlikely to be executed.  The function is optimized for
size rather than speed and on many targets it is placed into a special
subsection of the text section so all cold functions appear close together,
improving code locality of non-cold parts of program.  The paths leading
to calls of cold functions within code are marked as unlikely by the branch
prediction mechanism.  It is thus useful to mark functions used to handle
unlikely conditions, such as <code>perror</code>, as cold to improve optimization
of hot functions that do call marked functions in rare occasions.

     <p>When profile feedback is available, via <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>, cold functions

have no effects except to return a value.  Calls to such functions lend
themselves to optimization such as common subexpression elimination. 
The <code>const</code> attribute imposes greater restrictions on a function's
definition than the similar <code>pure</code> attribute below because it prohibits
the function from reading global variables.  Consequently, the presence of
the attribute on a function declaration allows GCC to emit more efficient
code for some calls to the function.  Decorating the same function with
both the <code>const</code> and the <code>pure</code> attribute is diagnosed.

     <p><a name="index-pointer-arguments-3485"></a>Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <em>not</em> be declared <code>const</code>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<code>const</code> function usually must not be
<code>const</code>.  Because a <code>const</code> function cannot have any side
effects it does not make sense for such a function to return <code>void</code>. 
Declaring such a function is diagnosed.

automatically before execution enters <code>main ()</code>.  Similarly, the
<code>destructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <code>main ()</code> completes or <code>exit ()</code> is
called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that is used implicitly during the execution of
the program.

     <p>You may provide an optional integer priority to control the order in
which constructor and destructor functions are run.  A constructor
with a smaller priority number runs before a constructor with a larger
priority number; the opposite relationship holds for destructors.  So,
if you have a constructor that allocates a resource and a destructor
that deallocates the same resource, both functions typically have the
same priority.  The priorities for constructor and destructor
functions are the same as those specified for namespace-scope C++
objects (see <a href="#C_002b_002b-Attributes">C++ Attributes</a>).  However, at present, the order in which
constructors for C++ objects with static storage duration and functions
decorated with attribute <code>constructor</code> are invoked is unspecified. 
In mixed declarations, attribute <code>init_priority</code> can be used to
impose a specific ordering.

information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

is used on a function declaration and a call to such a function

an error or warning (respectively) that includes <var>message</var> is diagnosed. 
This is useful
for compile-time checking, especially together with <code>__builtin_constant_p</code>
and inline functions where checking the inline function arguments is not
possible through <code>extern char [(condition) ? 1 : -1];</code> tricks.

     <p>While it is possible to leave the function undefined and thus invoke
a link failure (to define the function with

when using these attributes the problem is diagnosed
earlier and with exact location of the call even in presence of inline
functions or when not emitting debugging information.

<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style arguments that
should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <code>my_printf</code>
for consistency with the <code>printf</code> style format string argument
<code>my_format</code>.

     <p>The parameter <var>archetype</var> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>gnu_printf</code>, <code>gnu_scanf</code>, <code>gnu_strftime</code> or
<code>strfmon</code>.  (You can also use <code>__printf__</code>,
<code>__scanf__</code>, <code>__strftime__</code> or <code>__strfmon__</code>.)  On
MinGW targets, <code>ms_printf</code>, <code>ms_scanf</code>, and
<code>ms_strftime</code> are also present. 
<var>archetype</var> values such as <code>printf</code> refer to the formats accepted
by the system's C runtime library,
while values prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu_</span></samp>&rsquo; always refer
to the formats accepted by the GNU C Library.  On Microsoft Windows
targets, values prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ms_</span></samp>&rsquo; refer to the formats accepted by the
<samp><span class="file">msvcrt.dll</span></samp> library. 
The parameter <var>string-index</var>
specifies which argument is the format string argument (starting
from 1), while <var>first-to-check</var> is the number of the first
argument to check against the format string.  For functions
where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<code>vprintf</code>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
<code>strftime</code> formats, the third parameter is required to be zero. 
Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the
arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
giving values for <var>string-index</var> and <var>first-to-check</var>.

     <p>In the example above, the format string (<code>my_format</code>) is the second
argument of the function <code>my_print</code>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.

     <p><a name="index-ffreestanding-3496"></a><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-3497"></a>The <code>format</code> attribute allows you to identify your own functions

for the standard library functions <code>printf</code>, <code>fprintf</code>,
<code>sprintf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>fscanf</code>, <code>sscanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>vprintf</code>, <code>vfprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>.  In C99 mode, the functions
<code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsnprintf</code>, <code>vscanf</code>, <code>vfscanf</code> and
<code>vsscanf</code> are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
standard modes, the X/Open function <code>strfmon</code> is also checked as
are <code>printf_unlocked</code> and <code>fprintf_unlocked</code>. 
See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <p>For Objective-C dialects, <code>NSString</code> (or <code>__NSString__</code>) is
recognized in the same context.  Declarations including these format attributes
are parsed for correct syntax, however the result of checking of such format
strings is not yet defined, and is not carried out by this version of the

it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
<code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style

     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a <code>printf</code>,

format string argument is a call to the <code>my_dgettext</code> function, for
consistency with the format string argument <code>my_format</code>.  If the
<code>format_arg</code> attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp> is used, but the calls could not be checked
without the attribute.

     <p>The parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the arguments of such methods should
be counted from two.

     <p>The <code>format_arg</code> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions that modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
calls to <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code>
type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function. 
The compiler always treats <code>gettext</code>, <code>dgettext</code>, and

with the <code>inline</code> keyword.  It directs GCC to treat the function
as if it were defined in gnu90 mode even when compiling in C99 or
gnu99 mode.

     <p>If the function is declared <code>extern</code>, then this definition of the
function is used only for inlining.  In no case is the function
compiled as a standalone function, not even if you take its address
explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if you
had only declared the function, and had not defined it.  This has
almost the effect of a macro.  The way to use this is to put a
function definition in a header file with this attribute, and put
another copy of the function, without <code>extern</code>, in a library
file.  The definition in the header file causes most calls to the
function to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they
refer to the single copy in the library.  Note that the two
definitions of the functions need not be precisely the same, although
if they do not have the same effect your program may behave oddly.

     <p>In C, if the function is neither <code>extern</code> nor <code>static</code>, then
the function is compiled as a standalone function, as well as being
inlined where possible.

     <p>This is how GCC traditionally handled functions declared
<code>inline</code>.  Since ISO C99 specifies a different semantics for
<code>inline</code>, this function attribute is provided as a transition
measure and as a useful feature in its own right.  This attribute is
available in GCC 4.1.3 and later.  It is available if either of the
preprocessor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> or
<code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code> are defined.  See <a href="#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>.

     <p>In C++, this attribute does not depend on <code>extern</code> in any way,
but it still requires the <code>inline</code> keyword to enable its special
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>hot</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhot_007d-function-attribute-3501"></a>The <code>hot</code> attribute on a function is used to inform the compiler that

optimized more aggressively and on many targets it is placed into a special

improving locality.

function using the STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol type extension to the ELF
standard.  This allows the resolution of the symbol value to be
determined dynamically at load time, and an optimized version of the
routine to be selected for the particular processor or other system
characteristics determined then.  To use this attribute, first define
the implementation functions available, and a resolver function that
returns a pointer to the selected implementation function.  The
implementation functions' declarations must match the API of the
function being implemented.  The resolver should be declared to
be a function taking no arguments and returning a pointer to
a function of the same type as the implementation.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *my_memcpy (void *dst, const void *src, size_t len)
          {
            ...
            return dst;
          }
          
          static void * (*resolve_memcpy (void))(void *, const void *, size_t)
          {
            return my_memcpy; // we will just always select this routine
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The exported header file declaring the function the user calls would
contain:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">allowing the user to call <code>memcpy</code> as a regular function, unaware of
the actual implementation.  Finally, the indirect function needs to be
defined in the same translation unit as the resolver function:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
               __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));
</pre>
     <p>In C++, the <code>ifunc</code> attribute takes a string that is the mangled name
of the resolver function.  A C++ resolver for a non-static member function
of class <code>C</code> should be declared to return a pointer to a non-member
function taking pointer to <code>C</code> as the first argument, followed by
the same arguments as of the implementation function.  G++ checks
the signatures of the two functions and issues
a <samp><span class="option">-Wattribute-alias</span></samp> warning for mismatches.  To suppress a warning
for the necessary cast from a pointer to the implementation member function
to the type of the corresponding non-member function use
the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-pmf-conversions</span></samp> option.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          class S
          {
          private:
            int debug_impl (int);

          };

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code><dd>Many GCC back ends support attributes to indicate that a function is
an interrupt handler, which tells the compiler to generate function
entry and exit sequences that differ from those from regular
functions.  The exact syntax and behavior are target-specific;
refer to the following subsections for details.

     <br><dt><code>leaf</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bleaf_007d-function-attribute-3505"></a>Calls to external functions with this attribute must return to the
current compilation unit only by return or by exception handling.  In
particular, a leaf function is not allowed to invoke callback functions
passed to it from the current compilation unit, directly call functions
exported by the unit, or <code>longjmp</code> into the unit.  Leaf functions
might still call functions from other compilation units and thus they
are not necessarily leaf in the sense that they contain no function
calls at all.

     <p>The attribute is intended for library functions to improve dataflow
analysis.  The compiler takes the hint that any data not escaping the
current compilation unit cannot be used or modified by the leaf
function.  For example, the <code>sin</code> function is a leaf function, but
<code>qsort</code> is not.

     <p>Note that leaf functions might indirectly run a signal handler defined
in the current compilation unit that uses static variables.  Similarly,
when lazy symbol resolution is in effect, leaf functions might invoke
indirect functions whose resolver function or implementation function is
defined in the current compilation unit and uses static variables.  There
is no standard-compliant way to write such a signal handler, resolver
function, or implementation function, and the best that you can do is to
remove the <code>leaf</code> attribute or mark all such static variables
<code>volatile</code>.  Lastly, for ELF-based systems that support symbol
interposition, care should be taken that functions defined in the
current compilation unit do not unexpectedly interpose other symbols
based on the defined standards mode and defined feature test macros;
otherwise an inadvertent callback would be added.

     <p>The attribute has no effect on functions defined within the current
compilation unit.  This is to allow easy merging of multiple compilation
units into one, for example, by using the link-time optimization.  For
this reason the attribute is not allowed on types to annotate indirect
calls.

that the pointer <var>P</var> returned by the function cannot alias any
other pointer valid when the function returns, and moreover no
pointers to valid objects occur in any storage addressed by <var>P</var>.

     <p>Using this attribute can improve optimization.  Functions like
<code>malloc</code> and <code>calloc</code> have this property because they return
a pointer to uninitialized or zeroed-out storage.  However, functions
like <code>realloc</code> do not have this property, as they can return a
pointer to storage containing pointers.

<!-- Don't enumerate the optimizations by name here; we try to be -->
<!-- future-compatible with this mechanism. -->
If the function does not have side effects, there are optimizations
other than inlining that cause function calls to be optimized away,
although the function call is live.  To keep such calls from being
optimized away, put
     <pre class="smallexample">          asm ("");

attribute and its callers, as if the body of the function is not available
when optimizing callers and the callers are unavailable when optimizing
the body.  This attribute implies <code>noinline</code>, <code>noclone</code> and
<code>no_icf</code> attributes.    However, this attribute is not equivalent
to a combination of other attributes, because its purpose is to suppress
existing and future optimizations employing interprocedural analysis,
including those that do not have an attribute suitable for disabling
them individually.  This attribute is supported mainly for the purpose
of testing the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>nonnull (</code><var>arg-index</var><code>, ...)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnonnull_007d-function-attribute-3523"></a><a name="index-functions-with-non_002dnull-pointer-arguments-3524"></a>The <code>nonnull</code> attribute specifies that some function parameters should
be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
                  __attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check that, in calls to <code>my_memcpy</code>,
arguments <var>dest</var> and <var>src</var> are non-null.  If the compiler
determines that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked
as non-null, and the <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp> option is enabled, a warning
is issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
on the knowledge that certain function arguments will never be null.

     <p>If no argument index list is given to the <code>nonnull</code> attribute,
all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)

     <br><dt><code>noplt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnoplt_007d-function-attribute-3525"></a>The <code>noplt</code> attribute is the counterpart to option <samp><span class="option">-fno-plt</span></samp>. 
Calls to functions marked with this attribute in position-independent code
do not use the PLT.

     <pre class="smallexample">          /* Externally defined function foo.  */
          int foo () __attribute__ ((noplt));

            foo ();
            /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
          }
</pre>
     <p>The <code>noplt</code> attribute on function <code>foo</code>
tells the compiler to assume that
the function <code>foo</code> is externally defined and that the call to
<code>foo</code> must avoid the PLT
in position-independent code.

     <p>In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.

     <br><dt><code>noreturn</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnoreturn_007d-function-attribute-3526"></a><a name="index-functions-that-never-return-3527"></a>A few standard library functions, such as <code>abort</code> and <code>exit</code>,
cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<code>noreturn</code> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
          
          void
          fatal (/* <span class="roman">...</span> */)
          {
            /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ /* <span class="roman">Print error message.</span> */ /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
            exit (1);
          }
</pre>
     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<code>fatal</code> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <code>fatal</code> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.

     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword does not affect the exceptional path when that
applies: a <code>noreturn</code>-marked function may still return to the caller
by throwing an exception or calling <code>longjmp</code>.

     <p>Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <code>noreturn</code> function.

     <p>It does not make sense for a <code>noreturn</code> function to have a return
type other than <code>void</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nothrow</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnothrow_007d-function-attribute-3528"></a>The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
with the notable exceptions of <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code> that
take function pointer arguments.

     <br><dt><code>optimize</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007boptimize_007d-function-attribute-3529"></a>The <code>optimize</code> attribute is used to specify that a function is to
be compiled with different optimization options than specified on the
command line.  Arguments can either be numbers or strings.  Numbers
are assumed to be an optimization level.  Strings that begin with
<code>O</code> are assumed to be an optimization option, while other options
are assumed to be used with a <code>-f</code> prefix.  You can also use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma GCC optimize</span></samp>&rsquo; pragma to set the optimization options
that affect more than one function. 
See <a href="#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas">Function Specific Option Pragmas</a>, for details about the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma GCC optimize</span></samp>&rsquo; pragma.

     <p>This attribute should be used for debugging purposes only.  It is not
suitable in production code.

any means, padding the function entry with a number of NOPs can be
used to provide a universal tool for instrumentation.

     <p>The <code>patchable_function_entry</code> function attribute can be used to
change the number of NOPs to any desired value.  The two-value syntax
is the same as for the command-line switch
<samp><span class="option">-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</span></samp>, generating <var>N</var> NOPs, with
the function entry point before the <var>M</var>th NOP instruction. 
<var>M</var> defaults to 0 if omitted e.g. function entry point is before
the first NOP.

     <p>If patchable function entries are enabled globally using the command-line
option <samp><span class="option">-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</span></samp>, then you must disable
instrumentation on all functions that are part of the instrumentation
framework with the attribute <code>patchable_function_entry (0)</code>
to prevent recursion.

     <br><dt><code>pure</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpure_007d-function-attribute-3532"></a><a name="index-functions-that-have-no-side-effects-3533"></a>Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. 
Calls to such functions can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <code>pure</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">says that the hypothetical function <code>square</code> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.

     <p>Some common examples of pure functions are <code>strlen</code> or <code>memcmp</code>. 
Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
two consecutive calls (such as <code>feof</code> in a multithreading environment).

     <p>The <code>pure</code> attribute imposes similar but looser restrictions on
a function's defintion than the <code>const</code> attribute: it allows the
function to read global variables.  Decorating the same function with
both the <code>pure</code> and the <code>const</code> attribute is diagnosed. 
Because a <code>pure</code> function cannot have any side effects it does not
make sense for such a function to return <code>void</code>.  Declaring such
a function is diagnosed.

     <br><dt><code>returns_nonnull</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breturns_005fnonnull_007d-function-attribute-3534"></a>The <code>returns_nonnull</code> attribute specifies that the function
return value should be a non-null pointer.  For instance, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          mymalloc (size_t len) __attribute__((returns_nonnull));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">lets the compiler optimize callers based on the knowledge
that the return value will never be null.

return more than one time.  The compiler ensures that all registers
are dead before calling such a function and emits a warning about
the variables that may be clobbered after the second return from the
function.  Examples of such functions are <code>setjmp</code> and <code>vfork</code>. 
The <code>longjmp</code>-like counterpart of such function, if any, might need
to be marked with the <code>noreturn</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsection_007d-function-attribute-3537"></a><a name="index-functions-in-arbitrary-sections-3538"></a>Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <code>text</code> section. 
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section. 
For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">puts the function <code>foobar</code> in the <code>bar</code> section.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>sentinel</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsentinel_007d-function-attribute-3539"></a>This function attribute ensures that a parameter in a function call is
an explicit <code>NULL</code>.  The attribute is only valid on variadic
functions.  By default, the sentinel is located at position zero, the
last parameter of the function call.  If an optional integer position
argument P is supplied to the attribute, the sentinel must be located at
position P counting backwards from the end of the argument list.

     <pre class="smallexample">          __attribute__ ((sentinel))
          is equivalent to
          __attribute__ ((sentinel(0)))
</pre>
     <p>The attribute is automatically set with a position of 0 for the built-in
functions <code>execl</code> and <code>execlp</code>.  The built-in function
<code>execle</code> has the attribute set with a position of 1.

     <p>A valid <code>NULL</code> in this context is defined as zero with any pointer
type.  If your system defines the <code>NULL</code> macro with an integer type
then you need to add an explicit cast.  GCC replaces <code>stddef.h</code>
with a copy that redefines NULL appropriately.

     <p>The warnings for missing or incorrect sentinels are enabled with
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>simd</code><dt><code>simd("</code><var>mask</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsimd_007d-function-attribute-3540"></a>This attribute enables creation of one or more function versions that
can process multiple arguments using SIMD instructions from a
single invocation.  Specifying this attribute allows compiler to
assume that such versions are available at link time (provided
in the same or another translation unit).  Generated versions are
target-dependent and described in the corresponding Vector ABI document.  For
x86_64 target this document can be found
<a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=VectorABI.txt">here</a><!-- /@w -->.

     <p>The optional argument <var>mask</var> may have the value
<code>notinbranch</code> or <code>inbranch</code>,
and instructs the compiler to generate non-masked or masked
clones correspondingly. By default, all clones are generated.

     <p>If the attribute is specified and <code>#pragma omp declare simd</code> is
present on a declaration and the <samp><span class="option">-fopenmp</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fopenmp-simd</span></samp>
switch is specified, then the attribute is ignored.

     <br><dt><code>stack_protect</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstack_005fprotect_007d-function-attribute-3541"></a>This attribute adds stack protection code to the function if

     <br><dt><code>target (</code><var>options</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btarget_007d-function-attribute-3542"></a>Multiple target back ends implement the <code>target</code> attribute
to specify that a function is to
be compiled with different target options than specified on the
command line.  This can be used for instance to have functions
compiled with a different ISA (instruction set architecture) than the
default.  You can also use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma GCC target</span></samp>&rsquo; pragma to set
more than one function to be compiled with specific target options. 
See <a href="#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas">Function Specific Option Pragmas</a>, for details about the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma GCC target</span></samp>&rsquo; pragma.

     <p>For instance, on an x86, you could declare one function with the
<code>target("sse4.1,arch=core2")</code> attribute and another with
<code>target("sse4a,arch=amdfam10")</code>.  This is equivalent to
compiling the first function with <samp><span class="option">-msse4.1</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-march=core2</span></samp> options, and the second function with
<samp><span class="option">-msse4a</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-march=amdfam10</span></samp> options.  It is up to you
to make sure that a function is only invoked on a machine that
supports the particular ISA it is compiled for (for example by using
<code>cpuid</code> on x86 to determine what feature bits and architecture
family are used).

     <pre class="smallexample">          int core2_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("arch=core2")));
          int sse3_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("sse3")));
</pre>
     <p>You can either use multiple
strings separated by commas to specify multiple options,
or separate the options with a comma (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo;) within a single string.

be cloned into multiple versions compiled with different target options
than specified on the command line.  The supported options and restrictions
are the same as for <code>target</code> attribute.

     <p>For instance, on an x86, you could compile a function with
<code>target_clones("sse4.1,avx")</code>.  GCC creates two function clones,
one compiled with <samp><span class="option">-msse4.1</span></samp> and another with <samp><span class="option">-mavx</span></samp>.

     <p>On a PowerPC, you can compile a function with
<code>target_clones("cpu=power9,default")</code>.  GCC will create two
function clones, one compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=power9</span></samp> and another
with the default options.  GCC must be configured to use GLIBC 2.23 or
newer in order to use the <code>target_clones</code> attribute.

     <p>It also creates a resolver function (see
the <code>ifunc</code> attribute above) that dynamically selects a clone
suitable for current architecture.  The resolver is created only if there
is a usage of a function with <code>target_clones</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bunused_007d-function-attribute-3544"></a>This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant

function.

     <br><dt><code>used</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bused_007d-function-attribute-3545"></a>This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted
for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced. 
This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
inline assembly.

     <p>When applied to a member function of a C++ class template, the

          f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));
</pre>
     <p>The possible values of <var>visibility_type</var> correspond to the
visibility settings in the ELF gABI.

          <dl>
<!-- keep this list of visibilities in alphabetical order. -->

          <dt><code>default</code><dd>Default visibility is the normal case for the object file format. 
This value is available for the visibility attribute to override other
options that may change the assumed visibility of entities.

          <p>On ELF, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to other
modules and, in shared libraries, means that the declared entity may be
overridden.

          <p>On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to
other modules.

          <p>Default visibility corresponds to &ldquo;external linkage&rdquo; in the language.

          <br><dt><code>hidden</code><dd>Hidden visibility indicates that the entity declared has a new
form of linkage, which we call &ldquo;hidden linkage&rdquo;.  Two
declarations of an object with hidden linkage refer to the same object
if they are in the same shared object.

          <br><dt><code>internal</code><dd>Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the
psABI, GCC defines internal visibility to mean that a function is
<em>never</em> called from another module.  Compare this with hidden
functions which, while they cannot be referenced directly by other
modules, can be referenced indirectly via function pointers.  By
indicating that a function cannot be called from outside the module,
GCC may for instance omit the load of a PIC register since it is known
that the calling function loaded the correct value.

          <br><dt><code>protected</code><dd>Protected visibility is like default visibility except that it
indicates that references within the defining module bind to the
definition in that module.  That is, the declared entity cannot be
overridden by another module.

     </dl>

     <p>All visibilities are supported on many, but not all, ELF targets
(supported when the assembler supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.visibility</span></samp>&rsquo;
pseudo-op).  Default visibility is supported everywhere.  Hidden
visibility is supported on Darwin targets.

     <p>The visibility attribute should be applied only to declarations that
would otherwise have external linkage.  The attribute should be applied
consistently, so that the same entity should not be declared with
different settings of the attribute.

     <p>In C++, the visibility attribute applies to types as well as functions
and objects, because in C++ types have linkage.  A class must not have
greater visibility than its non-static data member types and bases,
and class members default to the visibility of their class.  Also, a
declaration without explicit visibility is limited to the visibility
of its type.

     <p>In C++, you can mark member functions and static member variables of a
class with the visibility attribute.  This is useful if you know a
particular method or static member variable should only be used from
one shared object; then you can mark it hidden while the rest of the
class has default visibility.  Care must be taken to avoid breaking
the One Definition Rule; for example, it is usually not useful to mark
an inline method as hidden without marking the whole class as hidden.

     <p>A C++ namespace declaration can also have the visibility attribute.

     <pre class="smallexample">          namespace nspace1 __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
</pre>
     <p>This attribute applies only to the particular namespace body, not to
other definitions of the same namespace; it is equivalent to using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma GCC visibility</span></samp>&rsquo; before and after the namespace
definition (see <a href="#Visibility-Pragmas">Visibility Pragmas</a>).

     <p>In C++, if a template argument has limited visibility, this
restriction is implicitly propagated to the template instantiation. 
Otherwise, template instantiations and specializations default to the
visibility of their template.

     <p>If both the template and enclosing class have explicit visibility, the
visibility from the template is used.

if a caller of the function with this attribute does not use its
return value.  This is useful for functions where not checking
the result is either a security problem or always a bug, such as
<code>realloc</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          int fn () __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
          int foo ()
          {

     <p class="noindent">results in warning on line 5.

     <br><dt><code>weak</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bweak_007d-function-attribute-3548"></a>The <code>weak</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
library functions that can be overridden in user code, though it can
also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported
for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler
and linker.

     <br><dt><code>weakref</code><dt><code>weakref ("</code><var>target</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bweakref_007d-function-attribute-3549"></a>The <code>weakref</code> attribute marks a declaration as a weak reference. 
Without arguments, it should be accompanied by an <code>alias</code> attribute
naming the target symbol.  Optionally, the <var>target</var> may be given as
an argument to <code>weakref</code> itself.  In either case, <code>weakref</code>
implicitly marks the declaration as <code>weak</code>.  Without a
<var>target</var>, given as an argument to <code>weakref</code> or to <code>alias</code>,
<code>weakref</code> is equivalent to <code>weak</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref ("y")));
          /* is equivalent to... */
          static int x() __attribute__ ((weak, weakref, alias ("y")));
          /* and to... */
          static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref));
          static int x() __attribute__ ((alias ("y")));
</pre>
     <p>A weak reference is an alias that does not by itself require a
definition to be given for the target symbol.  If the target symbol is
only referenced through weak references, then it becomes a <code>weak</code>
undefined symbol.  If it is directly referenced, however, then such
strong references prevail, and a definition is required for the
symbol, not necessarily in the same translation unit.

     <p>The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
separate translation unit, renaming the alias to the aliased symbol,
declaring it as weak, compiling the two separate translation units and
performing a reloadable link on them.

     <p>At present, a declaration to which <code>weakref</code> is attached can
only be <code>static</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.2 AArch64 Function Attributes</h4>

<p>The following target-specific function attributes are available for the
AArch64 target.  For the most part, these options mirror the behavior of
similar command-line options (see <a href="#AArch64-Options">AArch64 Options</a>), but on a
per-function basis.

     <dl>
<dt><code>general-regs-only</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgeneral_002dregs_002donly_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3550"></a>Indicates that no floating-point or Advanced SIMD registers should be
used when generating code for this function.  If the function explicitly
uses floating-point code, then the compiler gives an error.  This is
the same behavior as that of the command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-mgeneral-regs-only</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>fix-cortex-a53-835769</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfix_002dcortex_002da53_002d835769_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3551"></a>Indicates that the workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum 835769 should be
applied to this function.  To explicitly disable the workaround for this
function specify the negated form: <code>no-fix-cortex-a53-835769</code>. 
This corresponds to the behavior of the command line options
<samp><span class="option">-mfix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</span></samp>.

for the command line option <samp><span class="option">-mcmodel=</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>strict-align</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstrict_002dalign_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3553"></a>Indicates that the compiler should not assume that unaligned memory references
are handled by the system.  The behavior is the same as for the command-line
option <samp><span class="option">-mstrict-align</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>omit-leaf-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bomit_002dleaf_002dframe_002dpointer_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3554"></a>Indicates that the frame pointer should be omitted for a leaf function call. 
To keep the frame pointer, the inverse attribute
<code>no-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</code> can be specified.  These attributes have
the same behavior as the command-line options <samp><span class="option">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>tls-dialect=</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btls_002ddialect_003d_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3555"></a>Specifies the TLS dialect to use for this function.  The behavior and

<samp><span class="option">-mtls-dialect=</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>arch=</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007barch_003d_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3556"></a>Specifies the architecture version and architectural extensions to use
for this function.  The behavior and permissible arguments are the same as
for the <samp><span class="option">-march=</span></samp> command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>tune=</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btune_003d_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3557"></a>Specifies the core for which to tune the performance of this function. 
The behavior and permissible arguments are the same as for the <samp><span class="option">-mtune=</span></samp>
command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>cpu=</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcpu_003d_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3558"></a>Specifies the core for which to tune the performance of this function and also
whose architectural features to use.  The behavior and valid arguments are the
same as for the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span></samp> command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>sign-return-address</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsign_002dreturn_002daddress_007d-function-attribute_002c-AArch64-3559"></a>Select the function scope on which return address signing will be applied.  The
behavior and permissible arguments are the same as for the command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-msign-return-address=</span></samp>.  The default value is <code>none</code>.

 </dl>

 <p>The above target attributes can be specified as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((target("<var>attr-string</var>")))
     int
     f (int a)
     {
       return a + 5;
     }
</pre>
 <p>where <var>attr-string</var> is one of the attribute strings specified above.

 <p>Additionally, the architectural extension string may be specified on its
own.  This can be used to turn on and off particular architectural extensions
without having to specify a particular architecture version or core.  Example:

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((target("+crc+nocrypto")))
     int
     foo (int a)
     {
       return a + 5;
     }
</pre>
 <p>In this example <code>target("+crc+nocrypto")</code> enables the <code>crc</code>
extension and disables the <code>crypto</code> extension for the function <code>foo</code>
without modifying an existing <samp><span class="option">-march=</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> option.

 <p>Multiple target function attributes can be specified by separating them with
a comma.  For example:
<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((target("arch=armv8-a+crc+crypto,tune=cortex-a53")))
     int
     foo (int a)
     {
       return a + 5;
     }
</pre>
 <p>is valid and compiles function <code>foo</code> for ARMv8-A with <code>crc</code>
and <code>crypto</code> extensions and tunes it for <code>cortex-a53</code>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.31.2.1 Inlining rules</h5>

<p>Specifying target attributes on individual functions or performing link-time
optimization across translation units compiled with different target options
can affect function inlining rules:

 <p>In particular, a caller function can inline a callee function only if the
architectural features available to the callee are a subset of the features
available to the caller. 
For example: A function <code>foo</code> compiled with <samp><span class="option">-march=armv8-a+crc</span></samp>,
or tagged with the equivalent <code>arch=armv8-a+crc</code> attribute,
can inline a function <code>bar</code> compiled with <samp><span class="option">-march=armv8-a+nocrc</span></samp>
because the all the architectural features that function <code>bar</code> requires
are available to function <code>foo</code>.  Conversely, function <code>bar</code> cannot
inline function <code>foo</code>.

 <p>Additionally inlining a function compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mstrict-align</span></samp> into a
function compiled without <code>-mstrict-align</code> is not allowed. 
However, inlining a function compiled without <samp><span class="option">-mstrict-align</span></samp> into a
function compiled with <samp><span class="option">-mstrict-align</span></samp> is allowed.

 <p>Note that CPU tuning options and attributes such as the <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-mtune=</span></samp> do not inhibit inlining unless the CPU specified by the
<samp><span class="option">-mcpu=</span></samp> option or the <code>cpu=</code> attribute conflicts with the
architectural feature rules specified above.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.3 ARC Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the ARC back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3560"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>On the ARC, you must specify the kind of interrupt to be handled
in a parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("ilink1")));
</pre>
     <p>Permissible values for this parameter are: <code>ilink1</code><!-- /@w --> and
<code>ilink2</code><!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>long_call</code><dt><code>medium_call</code><dt><code>short_call</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blong_005fcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3561"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmedium_005fcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3562"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bshort_005fcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3563"></a><a name="index-indirect-calls_002c-ARC-3564"></a>These attributes specify how a particular function is called. 
These attributes override the
<samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mmedium-calls</span></samp> (see <a href="#ARC-Options">ARC Options</a>)
command-line switches and <code>#pragma long_calls</code> settings.

     <p>For ARC, a function marked with the <code>long_call</code> attribute is
always called using register-indirect jump-and-link instructions,
thereby enabling the called function to be placed anywhere within the
32-bit address space.  A function marked with the <code>medium_call</code>
attribute will always be close enough to be called with an unconditional
branch-and-link instruction, which has a 25-bit offset from
the call site.  A function marked with the <code>short_call</code>
attribute will always be close enough to be called with a conditional
branch-and-link instruction, which has a 21-bit offset from
the call site.

     <br><dt><code>jli_always</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bjli_005falways_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3565"></a>Forces a particular function to be called using <code>jli</code>
instruction.  The <code>jli</code> instruction makes use of a table stored
into <code>.jlitab</code> section, which holds the location of the functions
which are addressed using this instruction.

     <br><dt><code>jli_fixed</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bjli_005ffixed_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARC-3566"></a>Identical like the above one, but the location of the function in the

callable from normal mode.  The location of the secure call function
into the <code>sjli</code> table needs to be passed as argument.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.4 ARM Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported for ARM targets:

     <dl>
<dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3568"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>You can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by
adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Permissible values for this parameter are: <code>IRQ</code>, <code>FIQ</code>,
<code>SWI</code>, <code>ABORT</code> and <code>UNDEF</code>.

     <p>On ARMv7-M the interrupt type is ignored, and the attribute means the function
may be called with a word-aligned stack pointer.

     <br><dt><code>isr</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bisr_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3569"></a>Use this attribute on ARM to write Interrupt Service Routines. This is an
alias to the <code>interrupt</code> attribute above.

     <br><dt><code>long_call</code><dt><code>short_call</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blong_005fcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3570"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bshort_005fcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3571"></a><a name="index-indirect-calls_002c-ARM-3572"></a>These attributes specify how a particular function is called. 
These attributes override the
<samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp> (see <a href="#ARM-Options">ARM Options</a>)
command-line switch and <code>#pragma long_calls</code> settings.  For ARM, the
<code>long_call</code> attribute indicates that the function might be far
away from the call site and require a different (more expensive)
calling sequence.   The <code>short_call</code> attribute always places
the offset to the function from the call site into the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BL</span></samp>&rsquo;
instruction directly.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3573"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
<code>asm</code> statements can safely be included in naked functions
(see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). While using extended <code>asm</code> or a mixture of
basic <code>asm</code> and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.

     <br><dt><code>pcs</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpcs_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3574"></a>
The <code>pcs</code> attribute can be used to control the calling convention
used for a function on ARM.  The attribute takes an argument that specifies
the calling convention to use.

     <p>When compiling using the AAPCS ABI (or a variant of it) then valid
values for the argument are <code>"aapcs"</code> and <code>"aapcs-vfp"</code>.  In
order to use a variant other than <code>"aapcs"</code> then the compiler must
be permitted to use the appropriate co-processor registers (i.e., the
VFP registers must be available in order to use <code>"aapcs-vfp"</code>). 
For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          /* Argument passed in r0, and result returned in r0+r1.  */
          double f2d (float) __attribute__((pcs("aapcs")));
</pre>
     <p>Variadic functions always use the <code>"aapcs"</code> calling convention and
the compiler rejects attempts to specify an alternative.

     <br><dt><code>target (</code><var>options</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btarget_007d-function-attribute-3575"></a>As discussed in <a href="#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>, this attribute
allows specification of target-specific compilation options.

     <p>On ARM, the following options are allowed:

<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thumb</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btarget_0028_0022thumb_0022_0029_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3576"></a>Force code generation in the Thumb (T16/T32) ISA, depending on the

          <p>Functions from different modes can be inlined in the caller's mode.

The behavior and permissible arguments are the same as for the <samp><span class="option">-mfpu=</span></samp>
command-line option.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">arch=</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007barch_003d_007d-function-attribute_002c-ARM-3579"></a>Specifies the architecture version and architectural extensions to use
for this function.  The behavior and permissible arguments are the same as
for the <samp><span class="option">-march=</span></samp> command-line option.

          <p>The above target attributes can be specified as follows:

          <pre class="smallexample">               __attribute__((target("arch=armv8-a+crc")))
               int

               }
</pre>
          <p>Additionally, the architectural extension string may be specified on its
own.  This can be used to turn on and off particular architectural extensions
without having to specify a particular architecture version or core.  Example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               __attribute__((target("+crc+nocrypto")))
               int
               foo (int a)
               {
                 return a + 5;
               }
</pre>
          <p>In this example <code>target("+crc+nocrypto")</code> enables the <code>crc</code>
extension and disables the <code>crypto</code> extension for the function <code>foo</code>
without modifying an existing <samp><span class="option">-march=</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu</span></samp> option.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.5 AVR Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the AVR back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3580"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>On the AVR, the hardware globally disables interrupts when an
interrupt is executed.  The first instruction of an interrupt handler
declared with this attribute is a <code>SEI</code> instruction to
re-enable interrupts.  See also the <code>signal</code> function attribute
that does not insert a <code>SEI</code> instruction.  If both <code>signal</code> and
<code>interrupt</code> are specified for the same function, <code>signal</code>
is silently ignored.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3581"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
<code>asm</code> statements can safely be included in naked functions
(see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). While using extended <code>asm</code> or a mixture of
basic <code>asm</code> and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.

     <br><dt><code>no_gccisr</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bno_005fgccisr_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3582"></a>Do not use <code>__gcc_isr</code> pseudo instructions in a function with
the <code>interrupt</code> or <code>signal</code> attribute aka. interrupt
service routine (ISR). 
Use this attribute if the preamble of the ISR prologue should always read
     <pre class="example">          push  __zero_reg__
          push  __tmp_reg__
          in    __tmp_reg__, __SREG__
          push  __tmp_reg__
          clr   __zero_reg__
</pre>
     <p>and accordingly for the postamble of the epilogue &mdash; no matter whether
the mentioned registers are actually used in the ISR or not. 
Situations where you might want to use this attribute include:
          <ul>
<li>Code that (effectively) clobbers bits of <code>SREG</code> other than the
<code>I</code>-flag by writing to the memory location of <code>SREG</code>. 
<li>Code that uses inline assembler to jump to a different function which
expects (parts of) the prologue code as outlined above to be present. 
</ul>
     To disable <code>__gcc_isr</code> generation for the whole compilation unit,
there is option <samp><span class="option">-mno-gas-isr-prologues</span></samp>, see <a href="#AVR-Options">AVR Options</a>.

     <br><dt><code>OS_main</code><dt><code>OS_task</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bOS_005fmain_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3583"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bOS_005ftask_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3584"></a>On AVR, functions with the <code>OS_main</code> or <code>OS_task</code> attribute
do not save/restore any call-saved register in their prologue/epilogue.

     <p>The <code>OS_main</code> attribute can be used when there <em>is
guarantee</em> that interrupts are disabled at the time when the function
is entered.  This saves resources when the stack pointer has to be
changed to set up a frame for local variables.

     <p>The <code>OS_task</code> attribute can be used when there is <em>no
guarantee</em> that interrupts are disabled at that time when the function
is entered like for, e.g. task functions in a multi-threading operating
system. In that case, changing the stack pointer register is
guarded by save/clear/restore of the global interrupt enable flag.

     <p>The differences to the <code>naked</code> function attribute are:
          <ul>
<li><code>naked</code> functions do not have a return instruction whereas
<code>OS_main</code> and <code>OS_task</code> functions have a <code>RET</code> or
<code>RETI</code> return instruction. 
<li><code>naked</code> functions do not set up a frame for local variables
or a frame pointer whereas <code>OS_main</code> and <code>OS_task</code> do this
as needed. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><code>signal</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsignal_007d-function-attribute_002c-AVR-3585"></a>Use this attribute on the AVR to indicate that the specified
function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when this
attribute is present.

     <p>See also the <code>interrupt</code> function attribute.

     <p>The AVR hardware globally disables interrupts when an interrupt is executed. 
Interrupt handler functions defined with the <code>signal</code> attribute
do not re-enable interrupts.  It is save to enable interrupts in a
<code>signal</code> handler.  This &ldquo;save&rdquo; only applies to the code
generated by the compiler and not to the IRQ layout of the
application which is responsibility of the application.

     <p>If both <code>signal</code> and <code>interrupt</code> are specified for the same
function, <code>signal</code> is silently ignored.

<p>These function attributes are supported by the Epiphany back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>disinterrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdisinterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-Epiphany-3603"></a>This attribute causes the compiler to emit

function.

     <br><dt><code>forwarder_section</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bforwarder_005fsection_007d-function-attribute_002c-Epiphany-3604"></a>This attribute modifies the behavior of an interrupt handler. 
The interrupt handler may be in external memory which cannot be
reached by a branch instruction, so generate a local memory trampoline
to transfer control.  The single parameter identifies the section where
the trampoline is placed.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-Epiphany-3605"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.  It may also generate
a special section with code to initialize the interrupt vector table.

     <p>On Epiphany targets one or more optional parameters can be added like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"))) universal_dma_handler ();

     <p>Permissible values for these parameters are: <code>reset</code><!-- /@w -->,
<code>software_exception</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>page_miss</code><!-- /@w -->,
<code>timer0</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>timer1</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>message</code><!-- /@w -->,
<code>dma0</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>dma1</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>wand</code><!-- /@w --> and <code>swi</code><!-- /@w -->. 
Multiple parameters indicate that multiple entries in the interrupt
vector table should be initialized for this function, i.e. for each
parameter <var>name</var><!-- /@w -->, a jump to the function is emitted in
the section ivt_entry_<var>name</var><!-- /@w -->.  The parameter(s) may be omitted
entirely, in which case no interrupt vector table entry is provided.

     <p>Note that interrupts are enabled inside the function
unless the <code>disinterrupt</code> attribute is also specified.

     <p>The following examples are all valid uses of these attributes on
Epiphany targets:

            fast_timer_handler ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"),

that the specified function should be called through the function vector. 
Calling a function through the function vector reduces code size; however,
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H and H8S)
and shares space with the interrupt vector.

all input registers as live at all function exits.  This makes it possible
to restart a system call after an interrupt without having to save/restore
the input registers.  This also prevents kernel data from leaking into
application code.

symbol to contain a version string, thus allowing for function level
versioning.  HP-UX system header files may use function level versioning
for some system calls.

function is a fast interrupt handler.  This is just like the
<code>interrupt</code> attribute, except that <code>freit</code> is used to return
instead of <code>reit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>function_vector</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfunction_005fvector_007d-function-attribute_002c-M16C_002fM32C-3617"></a>On M16C/M32C targets, the <code>function_vector</code> attribute declares a
special page subroutine call function. Use of this attribute reduces
the code size by 2 bytes for each call generated to the
subroutine. The argument to the attribute is the vector number entry
from the special page vector table which contains the 16 low-order
bits of the subroutine's entry address. Each vector table has special
page number (18 to 255) that is used in <code>jsrs</code> instructions. 
Jump addresses of the routines are generated by adding 0x0F0000 (in
case of M16C targets) or 0xFF0000 (in case of M32C targets), to the
2-byte addresses set in the vector table. Therefore you need to ensure
that all the special page vector routines should get mapped within the
address range 0x0F0000 to 0x0FFFFF (for M16C) and 0xFF0000 to 0xFFFFFF
(for M32C).

     <p>In the following example 2 bytes are saved for each call to
function <code>foo</code>.

and are callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.17 Microsoft Windows Function Attributes</h4>

<p>The following attributes are available on Microsoft Windows and Symbian OS
targets.

     <dl>
<dt><code>dllexport</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdllexport_007d-function-attribute-3636"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllexport_0029_007d-3637"></a>On Microsoft Windows targets and Symbian OS targets the
<code>dllexport</code> attribute causes the compiler to provide a global
pointer to a pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the
<code>dllimport</code> attribute.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer
name is formed by combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable
name.

     <p>You can use <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> as a synonym for
<code>__attribute__ ((dllexport))</code> for compatibility with other
compilers.

     <p>On systems that support the <code>visibility</code> attribute, this
attribute also implies &ldquo;default&rdquo; visibility.  It is an error to
explicitly specify any other visibility.

     <p>GCC's default behavior is to emit all inline functions with the
<code>dllexport</code> attribute.  Since this can cause object file-size bloat,
you can use <samp><span class="option">-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</span></samp>, which tells GCC to
ignore the attribute for inlined functions unless the
<samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp> flag is used instead.

     <p>The attribute is ignored for undefined symbols.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks defined non-inlined
member functions and static data members as exports.  Static consts
initialized in-class are not marked unless they are also defined
out-of-class.

     <p>For Microsoft Windows targets there are alternative methods for
including the symbol in the DLL's export table such as using a
<samp><span class="file">.def</span></samp> file with an <code>EXPORTS</code> section or, with GNU ld, using
the <samp><span class="option">--export-all</span></samp> linker flag.

     <br><dt><code>dllimport</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdllimport_007d-function-attribute-3638"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllimport_0029_007d-3639"></a>On Microsoft Windows and Symbian OS targets, the <code>dllimport</code>
attribute causes the compiler to reference a function or variable via
a global pointer to a pointer that is set up by the DLL exporting the
symbol.  The attribute implies <code>extern</code>.  On Microsoft Windows
targets, the pointer name is formed by combining <code>_imp__</code> and the
function or variable name.

     <p>You can use <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> as a synonym for
<code>__attribute__ ((dllimport))</code> for compatibility with other
compilers.

     <p>On systems that support the <code>visibility</code> attribute, this
attribute also implies &ldquo;default&rdquo; visibility.  It is an error to
explicitly specify any other visibility.

     <p>Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions.  If the
attribute is applied to a symbol <em>definition</em>, an error is reported. 
If a symbol previously declared <code>dllimport</code> is later defined, the
attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a warning is emitted. 
The attribute is also overridden by a subsequent declaration as
<code>dllexport</code>.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined
member functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of vtables
using thunks.

     <p>On the SH Symbian OS target the <code>dllimport</code> attribute also has
another affect&mdash;it can cause the vtable and run-time type information
for a class to be exported.  This happens when the class has a
dllimported constructor or a non-inline, non-pure virtual function
and, for either of those two conditions, the class also has an inline
constructor or destructor and has a key function that is defined in
the current translation unit.

     <p>For Microsoft Windows targets the use of the <code>dllimport</code>
attribute on functions is not necessary, but provides a small
performance benefit by eliminating a thunk in the DLL.  The use of the
<code>dllimport</code> attribute on imported variables can be avoided by passing the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-auto-import</span></samp> switch to the GNU linker.  As with
functions, using the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in
the DLL.

     <p>One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a
<em>variable</em> marked as <code>dllimport</code> cannot be used as a constant
address. However, a pointer to a <em>function</em> with the
<code>dllimport</code> attribute can be used as a constant initializer; in
this case, the address of a stub function in the import lib is
referenced.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the attribute can be disabled
for functions by setting the <samp><span class="option">-mnop-fun-dllimport</span></samp> flag.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.18 MIPS Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the MIPS back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-MIPS-3640"></a>Use this attribute to indicate that the specified function is an interrupt
handler.  The compiler generates function entry and exit sequences suitable
for use in an interrupt handler when this attribute is present. 
An optional argument is supported for the interrupt attribute which allows
the interrupt mode to be described.  By default GCC assumes the external
interrupt controller (EIC) mode is in use, this can be explicitly set using
<code>eic</code>.  When interrupts are non-masked then the requested Interrupt
Priority Level (IPL) is copied to the current IPL which has the effect of only
enabling higher priority interrupts.  To use vectored interrupt mode use
the argument <code>vector=[sw0|sw1|hw0|hw1|hw2|hw3|hw4|hw5]</code>, this will change
the behavior of the non-masked interrupt support and GCC will arrange to mask
all interrupts from sw0 up to and including the specified interrupt vector.

     <p>You can use the following attributes to modify the behavior
of an interrupt handler:
          <dl>
<dt><code>use_shadow_register_set</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007buse_005fshadow_005fregister_005fset_007d-function-attribute_002c-MIPS-3641"></a>Assume that the handler uses a shadow register set, instead of
the main general-purpose registers.  An optional argument <code>intstack</code> is
supported to indicate that the shadow register set contains a valid stack
pointer.

          <br><dt><code>keep_interrupts_masked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bkeep_005finterrupts_005fmasked_007d-function-attribute_002c-MIPS-3642"></a>Keep interrupts masked for the whole function.  Without this attribute,
GCC tries to reenable interrupts for as much of the function as it can.

          <br><dt><code>use_debug_exception_return</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007buse_005fdebug_005fexception_005freturn_007d-function-attribute_002c-MIPS-3643"></a>Return using the <code>deret</code> instruction.  Interrupt handlers that don't
have this attribute return using <code>eret</code> instead. 
</dl>

     <p>You can use any combination of these attributes, as shown below:

The attributes override the <samp><span class="option">-mlong-calls</span></samp> (see <a href="#MIPS-Options">MIPS Options</a>)
command-line switch.  The <code>long_call</code> and <code>far</code> attributes are
synonyms, and cause the compiler to always call
the function by first loading its address into a register, and then using
the contents of that register.  The <code>short_call</code> and <code>near</code>
attributes are synonyms, and have the opposite
effect; they specify that non-PIC calls should be made using the more
efficient <code>jal</code> instruction.

On MIPS targets, you can use the <code>mips16</code> and <code>nomips16</code>
function attributes to locally select or turn off MIPS16 code generation. 
A function with the <code>mips16</code> attribute is emitted as MIPS16 code,
while MIPS16 code generation is disabled for functions with the

<samp><span class="option">-mips16</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mno-mips16</span></samp> options on the command line
(see <a href="#MIPS-Options">MIPS Options</a>).

     <p>When compiling files containing mixed MIPS16 and non-MIPS16 code, the
preprocessor symbol <code>__mips16</code> reflects the setting on the command line,
not that within individual functions.  Mixed MIPS16 and non-MIPS16 code
may interact badly with some GCC extensions such as <code>__builtin_apply</code>
(see <a href="#Constructing-Calls">Constructing Calls</a>).

On MIPS targets, you can use the <code>micromips</code> and <code>nomicromips</code>
function attributes to locally select or turn off microMIPS code generation. 
A function with the <code>micromips</code> attribute is emitted as microMIPS code,
while microMIPS code generation is disabled for functions with the

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.19 MSP430 Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the MSP430 back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>critical</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcritical_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3654"></a>Critical functions disable interrupts upon entry and restore the
previous interrupt state upon exit.  Critical functions cannot also
have the <code>naked</code> or <code>reentrant</code> attributes.  They can have
the <code>interrupt</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3655"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>You can provide an argument to the interrupt
attribute which specifies a name or number.  If the argument is a
number it indicates the slot in the interrupt vector table (0 - 31) to
which this handler should be assigned.  If the argument is a name it
is treated as a symbolic name for the vector slot.  These names should
match up with appropriate entries in the linker script.  By default
the names <code>watchdog</code> for vector 26, <code>nmi</code> for vector 30 and
<code>reset</code> for vector 31 are recognized.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3656"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
<code>asm</code> statements can safely be included in naked functions
(see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). While using extended <code>asm</code> or a mixture of
basic <code>asm</code> and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.

     <br><dt><code>reentrant</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breentrant_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3657"></a>Reentrant functions disable interrupts upon entry and enable them
upon exit.  Reentrant functions cannot also have the <code>naked</code>
or <code>critical</code> attributes.  They can have the <code>interrupt</code>
attribute.

     <br><dt><code>wakeup</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwakeup_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3658"></a>This attribute only applies to interrupt functions.  It is silently
ignored if applied to a non-interrupt function.  A wakeup interrupt
function will rouse the processor from any low-power state that it
might be in when the function exits.

     <br><dt><code>lower</code><dt><code>upper</code><dt><code>either</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blower_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3659"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bupper_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3660"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007beither_007d-function-attribute_002c-MSP430-3661"></a>On the MSP430 target these attributes can be used to specify whether
the function or variable should be placed into low memory, high
memory, or the placement should be left to the linker to decide.  The
attributes are only significant if compiling for the MSP430X
architecture.

     <p>The attributes work in conjunction with a linker script that has been
augmented to specify where to place sections with a <code>.lower</code> and
a <code>.upper</code> prefix.  So, for example, as well as placing the
<code>.data</code> section, the script also specifies the placement of a
<code>.lower.data</code> and a <code>.upper.data</code> section.  The intention
is that <code>lower</code> sections are placed into a small but easier to
access memory region and the upper sections are placed into a larger, but
slower to access, region.

     <p>The <code>either</code> attribute is special.  It tells the linker to place
the object into the corresponding <code>lower</code> section if there is
room for it.  If there is insufficient room then the object is placed
into the corresponding <code>upper</code> section instead.  Note that the
placement algorithm is not very sophisticated.  It does not attempt to
find an optimal packing of the <code>lower</code> sections.  It just makes
one pass over the objects and does the best that it can.  Using the
<samp><span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fdata-sections</span></samp> command-line
options can help the packing, however, since they produce smaller,
easier to pack regions.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.25 RL78 Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the RL78 back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>interrupt</code><dt><code>brk_interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-RL78-3709"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bbrk_005finterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-RL78-3710"></a>These attributes indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>Use <code>brk_interrupt</code> instead of <code>interrupt</code> for
handlers intended to be used with the <code>BRK</code> opcode (i.e. those
that must end with <code>RETB</code> instead of <code>RETI</code>).

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-RL78-3711"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
<code>asm</code> statements can safely be included in naked functions
(see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). While using extended <code>asm</code> or a mixture of
basic <code>asm</code> and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.26 RX Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the RX back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>fast_interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfast_005finterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-RX-3712"></a>Use this attribute on the RX port to indicate that the specified
function is a fast interrupt handler.  This is just like the
<code>interrupt</code> attribute, except that <code>freit</code> is used to return
instead of <code>reit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-RX-3713"></a>Use this attribute to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
when this attribute is present.

     <p>On RX and RL78 targets, you may specify one or more vector numbers as arguments
to the attribute, as well as naming an alternate table name. 
Parameters are handled sequentially, so one handler can be assigned to
multiple entries in multiple tables.  One may also pass the magic
string <code>"$default"</code> which causes the function to be used for any
unfilled slots in the current table.

     <p>This example shows a simple assignment of a function to one vector in
the default table (note that preprocessor macros may be used for
chip-specific symbolic vector names):
     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((interrupt (5))) txd1_handler ();
</pre>
     <p>This example assigns a function to two slots in the default table
(using preprocessor macros defined elsewhere) and makes it the default
for the <code>dct</code> table:
     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((interrupt (RXD1_VECT,RXD2_VECT,"dct","$default")))
          	txd1_handler ();
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-RX-3714"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.27 S/390 Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported on the S/390:

<dt><code>hotpatch (</code><var>halfwords-before-function-label</var><code>,</code><var>halfwords-after-function-label</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhotpatch_007d-function-attribute_002c-S_002f390-3716"></a>
On S/390 System z targets, you can use this function attribute to
make GCC generate a &ldquo;hot-patching&rdquo; function prologue.  If the
<samp><span class="option">-mhotpatch=</span></samp> command-line option is used at the same time,
the <code>hotpatch</code> attribute takes precedence.  The first of the
two arguments specifies the number of halfwords to be added before
the function label.  A second argument can be used to specify the
number of halfwords to be added after the function label.  For
both arguments the maximum allowed value is 1000000.

     <p>If both arguments are zero, hotpatching is disabled.

     <br><dt><code>target (</code><var>options</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btarget_007d-function-attribute-3717"></a>As discussed in <a href="#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>, this attribute
allows specification of target-specific compilation options.

     <p>On S/390, the following options are supported:

          <dl>

     <p>The options work exactly like the S/390 specific command line
options (without the prefix <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>) except that they do not
change any feature macros.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          <code>target("no-vx")</code>

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.28 SH Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported on the SH family of processors:

     <dl>
<dt><code>function_vector</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfunction_005fvector_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3718"></a><a name="index-calling-functions-through-the-function-vector-on-SH2A-3719"></a>On SH2A targets, this attribute declares a function to be called using the
TBR relative addressing mode.  The argument to this attribute is the entry
number of the same function in a vector table containing all the TBR
relative addressable functions.  For correct operation the TBR must be setup
accordingly to point to the start of the vector table before any functions with
this attribute are invoked.  Usually a good place to do the initialization is
the startup routine.  The TBR relative vector table can have at max 256 function
entries.  The jumps to these functions are generated using a SH2A specific,
non delayed branch instruction JSR/N @(disp8,TBR).  You must use GAS and GLD
from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for this attribute to work correctly.

     <p>In an application, for a function being called once, this attribute
saves at least 8 bytes of code; and if other successive calls are being
made to the same function, it saves 2 bytes of code per each of these
calls.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_005fhandler_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3720"></a>Use this attribute to
indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler
generates function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>nosave_low_regs</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnosave_005flow_005fregs_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3721"></a>Use this attribute on SH targets to indicate that an <code>interrupt_handler</code>
function should not save and restore registers R0..R7.  This can be used on SH3*
and SH4* targets that have a second R0..R7 register bank for non-reentrant
interrupt handlers.

     <br><dt><code>renesas</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007brenesas_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3722"></a>On SH targets this attribute specifies that the function or struct follows the
Renesas ABI.

     <br><dt><code>resbank</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bresbank_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3723"></a>On the SH2A target, this attribute enables the high-speed register
saving and restoration using a register bank for <code>interrupt_handler</code>
routines.  Saving to the bank is performed automatically after the CPU
accepts an interrupt that uses a register bank.

     <p>The nineteen 32-bit registers comprising general register R0 to R14,
control register GBR, and system registers MACH, MACL, and PR and the
vector table address offset are saved into a register bank.  Register
banks are stacked in first-in last-out (FILO) sequence.  Restoration
from the bank is executed by issuing a RESBANK instruction.

     <br><dt><code>sp_switch</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsp_005fswitch_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3724"></a>Use this attribute on the SH to indicate an <code>interrupt_handler</code>
function should switch to an alternate stack.  It expects a string
argument that names a global variable holding the address of the
alternate stack.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *alt_stack;
          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt_handler,
                                    sp_switch ("alt_stack")));
</pre>

<code>trapa</code> instead of <code>rte</code>.  This attribute expects an integer
argument specifying the trap number to be used.

     <br><dt><code>trapa_handler</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btrapa_005fhandler_007d-function-attribute_002c-SH-3726"></a>On SH targets this function attribute is similar to <code>interrupt_handler</code>
but it does not save and restore all registers.

<h4 class="subsection">6.31.33 x86 Function Attributes</h4>

<p>These function attributes are supported by the x86 back end:

     <dl>
<dt><code>cdecl</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcdecl_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86_002d32-3731"></a><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-x86_002d32-3732"></a><a name="index-mrtd-3733"></a>On the x86-32 targets, the <code>cdecl</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function pops off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <samp><span class="option">-mrtd</span></samp> switch.

     <br><dt><code>fastcall</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfastcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86_002d32-3734"></a><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-x86_002d32-3735"></a>On x86-32 targets, the <code>fastcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX and
the second argument (if of integral type) in the register EDX.  Subsequent
and other typed arguments are passed on the stack.  The called function
pops the arguments off the stack.  If the number of arguments is variable all
arguments are pushed on the stack.

     <br><dt><code>thiscall</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bthiscall_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86_002d32-3736"></a><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-x86_002d32-3737"></a>On x86-32 targets, the <code>thiscall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX. 
Subsequent and other typed arguments are passed on the stack. The called
function pops the arguments off the stack. 
If the number of arguments is variable all arguments are pushed on the
stack. 
The <code>thiscall</code> attribute is intended for C++ non-static member functions. 
As a GCC extension, this calling convention can be used for C functions
and for static member methods.

     <br><dt><code>ms_abi</code><dt><code>sysv_abi</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bms_005fabi_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3738"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsysv_005fabi_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3739"></a>
On 32-bit and 64-bit x86 targets, you can use an ABI attribute
to indicate which calling convention should be used for a function.  The
<code>ms_abi</code> attribute tells the compiler to use the Microsoft ABI,
while the <code>sysv_abi</code> attribute tells the compiler to use the ABI
used on GNU/Linux and other systems.  The default is to use the Microsoft ABI
when targeting Windows.  On all other systems, the default is the x86/AMD ABI.

     <p>Note, the <code>ms_abi</code> attribute for Microsoft Windows 64-bit targets currently
requires the <samp><span class="option">-maccumulate-outgoing-args</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>callee_pop_aggregate_return (</code><var>number</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcallee_005fpop_005faggregate_005freturn_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3740"></a>
On x86-32 targets, you can use this attribute to control how
aggregates are returned in memory.  If the caller is responsible for
popping the hidden pointer together with the rest of the arguments, specify
<var>number</var> equal to zero.  If callee is responsible for popping the
hidden pointer, specify <var>number</var> equal to one.

     <p>The default x86-32 ABI assumes that the callee pops the
stack for hidden pointer.  However, on x86-32 Microsoft Windows targets,
the compiler assumes that the
caller pops the stack for hidden pointer.

     <br><dt><code>ms_hook_prologue</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bms_005fhook_005fprologue_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3741"></a>
On 32-bit and 64-bit x86 targets, you can use
this function attribute to make GCC generate the &ldquo;hot-patching&rdquo; function
prologue used in Win32 API functions in Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2
and newer.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnaked_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3742"></a>This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
<code>asm</code> statements can safely be included in naked functions
(see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). While using extended <code>asm</code> or a mixture of
basic <code>asm</code> and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.

     <br><dt><code>regparm (</code><var>number</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bregparm_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3743"></a><a name="index-functions-that-are-passed-arguments-in-registers-on-x86_002d32-3744"></a>On x86-32 targets, the <code>regparm</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass arguments number one to <var>number</var> if they are of integral type
in registers EAX, EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions that
take a variable number of arguments continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.

     <p>Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
default).  Lazy binding sends the first call via resolving code in
the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered, as
per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is affected by this. 
Systems with the GNU C Library version 2.1 or higher
and FreeBSD are believed to be
safe since the loaders there save EAX, EDX and ECX.  (Lazy binding can be
disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the
problem.)

     <br><dt><code>sseregparm</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsseregparm_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3745"></a>On x86-32 targets with SSE support, the <code>sseregparm</code> attribute
causes the compiler to pass up to 3 floating-point arguments in
SSE registers instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments continue to pass all of their
floating-point arguments on the stack.

     <br><dt><code>force_align_arg_pointer</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bforce_005falign_005farg_005fpointer_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3746"></a>On x86 targets, the <code>force_align_arg_pointer</code> attribute may be
applied to individual function definitions, generating an alternate
prologue and epilogue that realigns the run-time stack if necessary. 
This supports mixing legacy codes that run with a 4-byte aligned stack
with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE compatibility.

     <br><dt><code>stdcall</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstdcall_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86_002d32-3747"></a><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-x86_002d32-3748"></a>On x86-32 targets, the <code>stdcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the called function pops off the stack space used to
pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.

     <br><dt><code>no_caller_saved_registers</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bno_005fcaller_005fsaved_005fregisters_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3749"></a>Use this attribute to indicate that the specified function has no
caller-saved registers. That is, all registers are callee-saved. For
example, this attribute can be used for a function called from an
interrupt handler. The compiler generates proper function entry and
exit sequences to save and restore any modified registers, except for
the EFLAGS register.  Since GCC doesn't preserve MPX, SSE, MMX nor x87
states, the GCC option <samp><span class="option">-mgeneral-regs-only</span></samp> should be used to
compile functions with <code>no_caller_saved_registers</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterrupt_007d-function-attribute_002c-x86-3750"></a>Use this attribute to indicate that the specified function is an
interrupt handler or an exception handler (depending on parameters passed
to the function, explained further).  The compiler generates function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when
this attribute is present.  The <code>IRET</code> instruction, instead of the
<code>RET</code> instruction, is used to return from interrupt handlers.  All
registers, except for the EFLAGS register which is restored by the
<code>IRET</code> instruction, are preserved by the compiler.  Since GCC
doesn't preserve MPX, SSE, MMX nor x87 states, the GCC option
<samp><span class="option">-mgeneral-regs-only</span></samp> should be used to compile interrupt and
exception handlers.

     <p>Any interruptible-without-stack-switch code must be compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-mno-red-zone</span></samp> since interrupt handlers can and will, because
of the hardware design, touch the red zone.

     <p>An interrupt handler must be declared with a mandatory pointer
argument:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct interrupt_frame;
          
          __attribute__ ((interrupt))
          void
          f (struct interrupt_frame *frame)
          {
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and you must define <code>struct interrupt_frame</code> as described in the
processor's manual.

     <p>Exception handlers differ from interrupt handlers because the system
pushes an error code on the stack.  An exception handler declaration is
similar to that for an interrupt handler, but with a different mandatory
function signature.  The compiler arranges to pop the error code off the
stack before the <code>IRET</code> instruction.

     <pre class="smallexample">          #ifdef __x86_64__
          typedef unsigned long long int uword_t;
          #else
          typedef unsigned int uword_t;
          #endif
          
          struct interrupt_frame;
          
          __attribute__ ((interrupt))
          void
          f (struct interrupt_frame *frame, uword_t error_code)
          {
            ...
          }
</pre>
     <p>Exception handlers should only be used for exceptions that push an error
code; you should use an interrupt handler in other cases.  The system
will crash if the wrong kind of handler is used.

compiler that the function's prologue should not be instrumented when
compiled with the <samp><span class="option">-fcf-protection=branch</span></samp> option.  The
compiler assumes that the function's address is a valid target for a
control-flow transfer.

          <p>The <code>nocf_check</code> attribute on a type of pointer to function is
used to inform the compiler that a call through the pointer should
not be instrumented when compiled with the
<samp><span class="option">-fcf-protection=branch</span></samp> option.  The compiler assumes
that the function's address from the pointer is a valid target for
a control-flow transfer.  A direct function call through a function
name is assumed to be a safe call thus direct calls are not
instrumented by the compiler.

          <p>The <code>nocf_check</code> attribute is applied to an object's type. 
In case of assignment of a function address or a function pointer to
another pointer, the attribute is not carried over from the right-hand
object's type; the type of left-hand object stays unchanged.  The
compiler checks for <code>nocf_check</code> attribute mismatch and reports
a warning in case of mismatch.

     <p>On the x86, the inliner does not inline a
function that has different target options than the caller, unless the
callee has a subset of the target options of the caller.  For example
a function declared with <code>target("sse3")</code> can inline a function
with <code>target("sse2")</code>, since <code>-msse3</code> implies <code>-msse2</code>.

The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Some
attributes are currently defined generically for variables. 
Other attributes are defined for variables on particular target
systems.  Other attributes are available for functions

<h4 class="subsection">6.32.1 Common Variable Attributes</h4>

<p>The following attributes are supported on most targets.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007baligned_007d-variable-attribute-3843"></a>
<dl><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <code>x</code> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <code>asm</code> expression to access the <code>move16</code> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.

     <p>You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <code>int</code> pair, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This is an alternative to creating a union with a <code>double</code> member,
which forces the union to be double-word aligned.

     <p>As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given variable or
structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a variable or field to the
default alignment for the target architecture you are compiling for. 
The default alignment is sufficient for all scalar types, but may not be
enough for all vector types on a target that supports vector operations. 
The default alignment is fixed for a particular target ABI.

     <p>GCC also provides a target specific macro <code>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</code>,
which is the largest alignment ever used for any data type on the
target machine you are compiling for.  For example, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned (__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__)));
</pre>
     <p>The compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
variable or field to <code>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</code>.  Doing this can
often make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can
use whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when
performing copies to or from the variables or fields that you have
aligned this way.  Note that the value of <code>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</code>
may change depending on command-line options.

     <p>When used on a struct, or struct member, the <code>aligned</code> attribute can
only increase the alignment; in order to decrease it, the <code>packed</code>
attribute must be specified as well.  When used as part of a typedef, the
<code>aligned</code> attribute can both increase and decrease alignment, and
specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute generates a warning.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8-byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> still only provides you with 8-byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

     <p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can also be used for functions
(see <a href="#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>.)

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwarn_005fif_005fnot_005faligned_007d-variable-attribute-3844"></a><br><dt><code>warn_if_not_aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a threshold for the structure field, measured
in bytes.  If the structure field is aligned below the threshold, a
warning will be issued.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            unsigned long long x __attribute__((warn_if_not_aligned(16)));
          };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to issue an warning on <code>struct foo</code>, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: alignment 8 of 'struct foo' is less than 16</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The compiler also issues a warning, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: 'x' offset
8 in 'struct foo' isn't aligned to 16</span></samp>&rsquo;, when the structure field has
the misaligned offset:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            unsigned long long x __attribute__((warn_if_not_aligned(16)));
          } __attribute__((aligned(16)));
</pre>
     <p>This warning can be disabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wno-if-not-aligned</span></samp>. 
The <code>warn_if_not_aligned</code> attribute can also be used for types
(see <a href="#Common-Type-Attributes">Common Type Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>cleanup (</code><var>cleanup_function</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcleanup_007d-variable-attribute-3845"></a>The <code>cleanup</code> attribute runs a function when the variable goes
out of scope.  This attribute can only be applied to auto function
scope variables; it may not be applied to parameters or variables
with static storage duration.  The function must take one parameter,
a pointer to a type compatible with the variable.  The return value
of the function (if any) is ignored.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">-fexceptions</span></samp> is enabled, then <var>cleanup_function</var>
is run during the stack unwinding that happens during the
processing of the exception.  Note that the <code>cleanup</code> attribute
does not allow the exception to be caught, only to perform an action. 
It is undefined what happens if <var>cleanup_function</var> does not
return normally.

     <br><dt><code>common</code><dt><code>nocommon</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcommon_007d-variable-attribute-3846"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnocommon_007d-variable-attribute-3847"></a><a name="index-fcommon-3848"></a><a name="index-fno_002dcommon-3849"></a>The <code>common</code> attribute requests GCC to place a variable in
&ldquo;common&rdquo; storage.  The <code>nocommon</code> attribute requests the
opposite&mdash;to allocate space for it directly.

     <p>These attributes override the default chosen by the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-common</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fcommon</span></samp> flags respectively.

     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dt><code>deprecated (</code><var>msg</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-variable-attribute-3850"></a>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the variable
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
variables that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated variable, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the variable is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warning only occurs for uses:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int old_var __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          extern int old_var;
          int new_fn () { return old_var; }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional <var>msg</var>
argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
present.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for functions and
types (see <a href="#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>,
see <a href="#Common-Type-Attributes">Common Type Attributes</a>).

     <br><dt><code>nonstring</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnonstring_007d-variable-attribute-3851"></a>The <code>nonstring</code> variable attribute specifies that an object or member
declaration with type array of <code>char</code>, <code>signed char</code>, or
<code>unsigned char</code>, or pointer to such a type is intended to store
character arrays that do not necessarily contain a terminating <code>NUL</code>. 
This is useful in detecting uses of such arrays or pointers with functions
that expect <code>NUL</code>-terminated strings, and to avoid warnings when such
an array or pointer is used as an argument to a bounded string manipulation
function such as <code>strncpy</code>.  For example, without the attribute, GCC
will issue a warning for the <code>strncpy</code> call below because it may
truncate the copy without appending the terminating <code>NUL</code> character. 
Using the attribute makes it possible to suppress the warning.  However,
when the array is declared with the attribute the call to <code>strlen</code> is
diagnosed because when the array doesn't contain a <code>NUL</code>-terminated
string the call is undefined.  To copy, compare, of search non-string
character arrays use the <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memcmp</code>, <code>memchr</code>,
and other functions that operate on arrays of bytes.  In addition,
calling <code>strnlen</code> and <code>strndup</code> with such arrays is safe
provided a suitable bound is specified, and not diagnosed.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct Data
          {
            char name [32] __attribute__ ((nonstring));
          };
          
          int f (struct Data *pd, const char *s)
          {
            strncpy (pd-&gt;name, s, sizeof pd-&gt;name);
            ...
            return strlen (pd-&gt;name);   // unsafe, gets a warning
          }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>mode (</code><var>mode</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmode_007d-variable-attribute-3852"></a>This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration&mdash;whichever
type corresponds to the mode <var>mode</var>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating-point type according to its width.

     <p>See <a href="gccint.html#Machine-Modes">Machine Modes</a>,
for a list of the possible keywords for <var>mode</var>. 
You may also specify a mode of <code>byte</code> or <code>__byte__</code> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <code>word</code> or
<code>__word__</code> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <code>pointer</code>
or <code>__pointer__</code> for the mode used to represent pointers.

     <br><dt><code>packed</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpacked_007d-variable-attribute-3853"></a>The <code>packed</code> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment&mdash;one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<code>aligned</code> attribute.

     <p>Here is a structure in which the field <code>x</code> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <code>a</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            char a;
            int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
          };
</pre>
     <p><em>Note:</em> The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the
<code>packed</code> attribute on bit-fields of type <code>char</code>.  This has
been fixed in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the
structure layout.  See the documentation of
<samp><span class="option">-Wpacked-bitfield-compat</span></samp> for more information.

     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsection_007d-variable-attribute-3854"></a>Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections like
<code>data</code> and <code>bss</code>.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
or you need certain particular variables to appear in special sections,
for example to map to special hardware.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives in a particular
section.  For example, this small program uses several specific section names:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
          struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
          char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
          int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA")));
          
          main()
          {
            /* <span class="roman">Initialize stack pointer</span> */
            init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));
          
            /* <span class="roman">Initialize initialized data</span> */
            memcpy (&amp;init_data, &amp;data, &amp;edata - &amp;data);
          
            /* <span class="roman">Turn on the serial ports</span> */
            init_duart (&amp;a);
            init_duart (&amp;b);
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Use the <code>section</code> attribute with
<em>global</em> variables and not <em>local</em> variables,
as shown in the example.

     <p>You may use the <code>section</code> attribute with initialized or
uninitialized global variables but the linker requires
each object be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized
variables tentatively go in the <code>common</code> (or <code>bss</code>) section
and can be multiply &ldquo;defined&rdquo;.  Using the <code>section</code> attribute
changes what section the variable goes into and may cause the
linker to issue an error if an uninitialized variable has multiple
definitions.  You can force a variable to be initialized with the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-common</span></samp> flag or the <code>nocommon</code> attribute.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>tls_model ("</code><var>tls_model</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btls_005fmodel_007d-variable-attribute-3855"></a>The <code>tls_model</code> attribute sets thread-local storage model
(see <a href="#Thread_002dLocal">Thread-Local</a>) of a particular <code>__thread</code> variable,
overriding <samp><span class="option">-ftls-model=</span></samp> command-line switch on a per-variable
basis. 
The <var>tls_model</var> argument should be one of <code>global-dynamic</code>,
<code>local-dynamic</code>, <code>initial-exec</code> or <code>local-exec</code>.

     <p>Not all targets support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bunused_007d-variable-attribute-3856"></a>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is meant
to be possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for this
variable.

     <br><dt><code>used</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bused_007d-variable-attribute-3857"></a>This attribute, attached to a variable with static storage, means that
the variable must be emitted even if it appears that the variable is not
referenced.

     <p>When applied to a static data member of a C++ class template, the
attribute also means that the member is instantiated if the
class itself is instantiated.

     <br><dt><code>vector_size (</code><var>bytes</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvector_005fsize_007d-variable-attribute-3858"></a>This attribute specifies the vector size for the variable, measured in
bytes.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to set the mode for <code>foo</code>, to be 16 bytes,
divided into <code>int</code> sized units.  Assuming a 32-bit int (a vector of
4 units of 4 bytes), the corresponding mode of <code>foo</code> is V4SI.

     <p>This attribute is only applicable to integral and float scalars,
although arrays, pointers, and function return values are allowed in
conjunction with this construct.

     <p>Aggregates with this attribute are invalid, even if they are of the same
size as a corresponding scalar.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { int a; };
          struct S  __attribute__ ((vector_size (16))) foo;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">is invalid even if the size of the structure is the same as the size of
the <code>int</code>.

     <br><dt><code>visibility ("</code><var>visibility_type</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvisibility_007d-variable-attribute-3859"></a>This attribute affects the linkage of the declaration to which it is attached. 
The <code>visibility</code> attribute is described in
<a href="#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>.

     <br><dt><code>weak</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bweak_007d-variable-attribute-3860"></a>The <code>weak</code> attribute is described in

data in the non-volatile program memory (flash). The <code>progmem</code>
attribute accomplishes this by putting respective variables into a
section whose name starts with <code>.progmem</code>.

     <p>This attribute works similar to the <code>section</code> attribute
but adds additional checking.

          <p>AVR is a Harvard architecture processor and data and read-only data
normally resides in the data memory (RAM).

          <p>See also the <a href="#AVR-Named-Address-Spaces">AVR Named Address Spaces</a> section for
an alternate way to locate and access data in flash memory.

          <br><dt>&bull;&nbsp; AVR cores with flash memory visible in the RAM address range:<dd>On such devices, there is no need for attribute <code>progmem</code> or
<a href="#AVR-Named-Address-Spaces"><code>__flash</code></a> qualifier at all. 
Just use standard C / C++.  The compiler will generate <code>LD*</code>
instructions.  As flash memory is visible in the RAM address range,
and the default linker script does <em>not</em> locate <code>.rodata</code> in
RAM, no special features are needed in order not to waste RAM for
read-only data or to read from flash.  You might even get slightly better
performance by
avoiding <code>progmem</code> and <code>__flash</code>.  This applies to devices from
families <code>avrtiny</code> and <code>avrxmega3</code>, see <a href="#AVR-Options">AVR Options</a> for
an overview.

          <br><dt>&bull;&nbsp;Reduced AVR Tiny cores like ATtiny40:<dd>The compiler adds <code>0x4000</code>

If an address is specified, the variable

<h4 class="subsection">6.32.8 MeP Variable Attributes</h4>

<p>The MeP target has a number of addressing modes and busses.  The

(24 bits).  The <code>far</code> space spans the entire 32-bit memory space. 
The <code>based</code> space is a 128-byte region in the memory space that
is addressed relative to the <code>$tp</code> register.  The <code>tiny</code>
space is a 65536-byte region relative to the <code>$gp</code> register.  In
addition to these memory regions, the MeP target has a separate 16-bit
control bus which is specified with <code>cb</code> attributes.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>near</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnear_007d-variable-attribute_002c-MeP-3880"></a>Variables with the <code>near</code> attribute are assumed to have addresses
that fit in a 24-bit addressing mode.  This is the default for large
variables (<code>-mtiny=4</code> is the default) but this attribute can
override <code>-mtiny=</code> for small variables, or override <code>-ml</code>.

     <br><dt><code>far</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfar_007d-variable-attribute_002c-MeP-3881"></a>Variables with the <code>far</code> attribute are addressed using a full

memory-mapped peripherals.  If an address is specified, the variable
is assigned that address, else it is not assigned an address (it is

     <br><dt><code>selectany</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bselectany_007d-variable-attribute-3886"></a>The <code>selectany</code> attribute causes an initialized global variable to
have link-once semantics.  When multiple definitions of the variable are
encountered by the linker, the first is selected and the remainder are
discarded.  Following usage by the Microsoft compiler, the linker is told
<em>not</em> to warn about size or content differences of the multiple
definitions.

     <p>Although the primary usage of this attribute is for POD types, the
attribute can also be applied to global C++ objects that are initialized
by a constructor.  In this case, the static initialization and destruction
code for the object is emitted in each translation defining the object,
but the calls to the constructor and destructor are protected by a
link-once guard variable.

     <p>The <code>selectany</code> attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows
targets.  You can use <code>__declspec (selectany)</code> as a synonym for
<code>__attribute__ ((selectany))</code> for compatibility with other
compilers.

     <br><dt><code>shared</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bshared_007d-variable-attribute-3887"></a>On Microsoft Windows, in addition to putting variable definitions in a named
section, the section can also be shared among all running copies of an
executable or DLL.  For example, this small program defines shared data
by putting it in a named section <code>shared</code> and marking the section
shareable:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo __attribute__((section ("shared"), shared)) = 0;
          
          int
          main()
          {
            /* <span class="roman">Read and write foo.  All running
               copies see the same value.</span>  */
            return 0;
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You may only use the <code>shared</code> attribute along with <code>section</code>
attribute with a fully-initialized global definition because of the way
linkers work.  See <code>section</code> attribute for more information.

     <p>The <code>shared</code> attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows.

allowed also), GCC places the variable in the first 0x100 bytes of
memory and use special opcodes to access it.  Such variables are
placed in either the <code>.bss_below100</code> section or the
<code>.data_below100</code> section.

<h3 class="section">6.33 Specifying Attributes of Types</h3>

<p><a name="index-attribute-of-types-3905"></a><a name="index-type-attributes-3906"></a>
The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of types.  Some type attributes apply only to <code>struct</code>
and <code>union</code> types, while others can apply to any type defined
via a <code>typedef</code> declaration.  Other attributes are defined for
functions (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), labels (see <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>), enumerators (see <a href="#Enumerator-Attributes">Enumerator Attributes</a>),
statements (see <a href="#Statement-Attributes">Statement Attributes</a>), and for
variables (see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).

 <p>The <code>__attribute__</code> keyword is followed by an attribute specification
inside double parentheses.

 <p>You may specify type attributes in an enum, struct or union type
declaration or definition by placing them immediately after the
<code>struct</code>, <code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> keyword.  A less preferred
syntax is to place them just past the closing curly brace of the
definition.

 <p>You can also include type attributes in a <code>typedef</code> declaration. 
See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

<h4 class="subsection">6.33.1 Common Type Attributes</h4>

<p>The following type attributes are supported on most targets.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007baligned_007d-type-attribute-3907"></a>
<dl><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
          typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">force the compiler to ensure (as far as it can) that each variable whose
type is <code>struct S</code> or <code>more_aligned_int</code> is allocated and
aligned <em>at least</em> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a SPARC, having all
variables of type <code>struct S</code> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <code>struct S</code> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

     <p>Note that the alignment of any given <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type
is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> in question.  This means that you <em>can</em>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>
type by attaching an <code>aligned</code> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.

     <p>As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <code>struct</code>
or <code>union</code> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
</pre>
     <p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment that is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables that have types that you have aligned
this way.

     <p>In the example above, if the size of each <code>short</code> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <code>struct S</code> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two that is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <code>struct S</code> type to 8
bytes.

     <p>Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program also does pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations is often more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8-byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> still only provides you with 8-byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

     <p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can only increase alignment.  Alignment
can be decreased by specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute.  See below.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwarn_005fif_005fnot_005faligned_007d-type-attribute-3908"></a><br><dt><code>warn_if_not_aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a threshold for the structure field, measured
in bytes.  If the structure field is aligned below the threshold, a
warning will be issued.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef unsigned long long __u64
             __attribute__((aligned(4),warn_if_not_aligned(8)));
          
          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            __u64 x;
          };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to issue an warning on <code>struct foo</code>, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: alignment 4 of 'struct foo' is less than 8</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
It is used to define <code>struct foo</code> in such a way that
<code>struct foo</code> has the same layout and the structure field <code>x</code>
has the same alignment when <code>__u64</code> is aligned at either 4 or
8 bytes.  Align <code>struct foo</code> to 8 bytes:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            __u64 x;
          } __attribute__((aligned(8)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">silences the warning.  The compiler also issues a warning, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: 'x' offset 12 in 'struct foo' isn't aligned to 8</span></samp>&rsquo;,
when the structure field has the misaligned offset:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            int i3;
            __u64 x;
          } __attribute__((aligned(8)));
</pre>
     <p>This warning can be disabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wno-if-not-aligned</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>bnd_variable_size</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bbnd_005fvariable_005fsize_007d-type-attribute-3909"></a><a name="index-Pointer-Bounds-Checker-attributes-3910"></a>When applied to a structure field, this attribute tells Pointer
Bounds Checker that the size of this field should not be computed
using static type information.  It may be used to mark variably-sized
static array fields placed at the end of a structure.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S

is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
types that are expected to be removed in a future version of a program. 
If possible, the warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated type, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the type is deprecated, or what they should do
instead.  Note that the warnings only occur for uses and then only
if the type is being applied to an identifier that itself is not being
declared as deprecated.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int T1 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T1 x;
          typedef T1 T2;
          T2 y;
          typedef T1 T3 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T3 z __attribute__ ((deprecated));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">results in a warning on line 2 and 3 but not lines 4, 5, or 6.  No
warning is issued for line 4 because T2 is not explicitly
deprecated.  Line 5 has no warning because T3 is explicitly
deprecated.  Similarly for line 6.  The optional <var>msg</var>
argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
present.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for functions and
variables (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>designated_init</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdesignated_005finit_007d-type-attribute-3912"></a>This attribute may only be applied to structure types.  It indicates
that any initialization of an object of this type must use designated
initializers rather than positional initializers.  The intent of this
attribute is to allow the programmer to indicate that a structure's
layout may change, and that therefore relying on positional
initialization will result in future breakage.

     <p>GCC emits warnings based on this attribute by default; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-designated-init</span></samp> to suppress them.

     <br><dt><code>may_alias</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmay_005falias_007d-type-attribute-3913"></a>Accesses through pointers to types with this attribute are not subject
to type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be able to alias
any other type of objects. 
In the context of section 6.5 paragraph 7 of the C99 standard,
an lvalue expression
dereferencing such a pointer is treated like having a character type. 
See <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp> for more information on aliasing issues. 
This extension exists to support some vector APIs, in which pointers to
one vector type are permitted to alias pointers to a different vector type.

     <p>Note that an object of a type with this attribute does not have any
special semantics.

     <p>Example of use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef short __attribute__((__may_alias__)) short_a;
          
          int
          main (void)
          {
            int a = 0x12345678;
            short_a *b = (short_a *) &amp;a;
          
            b[1] = 0;
          
            if (a == 0x12345678)
              abort();
          
            exit(0);
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you replaced <code>short_a</code> with <code>short</code> in the variable
declaration, the above program would abort when compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>, which is on by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or
above.

     <br><dt><code>packed</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpacked_007d-type-attribute-3914"></a>This attribute, attached to <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type
definition, specifies that each member (other than zero-width bit-fields)
of the structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required.  When
attached to an <code>enum</code> definition, it indicates that the smallest
integral type should be used.

     <p><a name="index-fshort_002denums-3915"></a>Specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute for <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code>
types is equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute on each
of the structure or union members.  Specifying the <samp><span class="option">-fshort-enums</span></samp>
flag on the command line is equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code>
attribute on all <code>enum</code> definitions.

     <p>In the following example <code>struct my_packed_struct</code>'s members are
packed closely together, but the internal layout of its <code>s</code> member
is not packed&mdash;to do that, <code>struct my_unpacked_struct</code> needs to
be packed too.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct my_unpacked_struct
           {
              char c;
              int i;
           };
          
          struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) my_packed_struct
            {
               char c;
               int  i;
               struct my_unpacked_struct s;
            };
</pre>
     <p>You may only specify the <code>packed</code> attribute attribute on the definition
of an <code>enum</code>, <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>, not on a <code>typedef</code>
that does not also define the enumerated type, structure or union.

     <br><dt><code>scalar_storage_order ("</code><var>endianness</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bscalar_005fstorage_005forder_007d-type-attribute-3916"></a>When attached to a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>, this attribute sets
the storage order, aka endianness, of the scalar fields of the type, as
well as the array fields whose component is scalar.  The supported
endiannesses are <code>big-endian</code> and <code>little-endian</code>.  The attribute
has no effects on fields which are themselves a <code>union</code>, a <code>struct</code>
or an array whose component is a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>, and it is
possible for these fields to have a different scalar storage order than the
enclosing type.

     <p>This attribute is supported only for targets that use a uniform default
scalar storage order (fortunately, most of them), i.e. targets that store
the scalars either all in big-endian or all in little-endian.

     <p>Additional restrictions are enforced for types with the reverse scalar
storage order with regard to the scalar storage order of the target:

          <ul>
<li>Taking the address of a scalar field of a <code>union</code> or a
<code>struct</code> with reverse scalar storage order is not permitted and yields
an error. 
<li>Taking the address of an array field, whose component is scalar, of
a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code> with reverse scalar storage order is
permitted but yields a warning, unless <samp><span class="option">-Wno-scalar-storage-order</span></samp>
is specified. 
<li>Taking the address of a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code> with reverse
scalar storage order is permitted. 
</ul>

     <p>These restrictions exist because the storage order attribute is lost when
the address of a scalar or the address of an array with scalar component is
taken, so storing indirectly through this address generally does not work. 
The second case is nevertheless allowed to be able to perform a block copy
from or to the array.

     <p>Moreover, the use of type punning or aliasing to toggle the storage order
is not supported; that is to say, a given scalar object cannot be accessed
through distinct types that assign a different storage order to it.

     <br><dt><code>transparent_union</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btransparent_005funion_007d-type-attribute-3917"></a>
This attribute, attached to a <code>union</code> type definition, indicates
that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to that
function to be treated in a special way.

     <p>First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can be of
any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the union contains
a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a null pointer
constant or a void pointer expression; and if the union contains a void
pointer type, the corresponding argument can be any pointer expression. 
If the union member type is a pointer, qualifiers like <code>const</code> on
the referenced type must be respected, just as with normal pointer
conversions.

     <p>Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
conventions of the first member of the transparent union, not the calling
conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union must have the
same machine representation; this is necessary for this argument passing
to work properly.

     <p>Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have multiple
interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example, suppose the
<code>wait</code> function must accept either a value of type <code>int *</code> to
comply with POSIX, or a value of type <code>union wait *</code> to comply with
the 4.1BSD interface.  If <code>wait</code>'s parameter were <code>void *</code>,
<code>wait</code> would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type checking
less useful.  Instead, <code>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</code> might define the interface
as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef union __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__))
            {
              int *__ip;
              union wait *__up;
            } wait_status_ptr_t;
          
          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This interface allows either <code>int *</code> or <code>union wait *</code>
arguments to be passed, using the <code>int *</code> calling convention. 
The program can call <code>wait</code> with arguments of either type:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int w1 () { int w; return wait (&amp;w); }
          int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&amp;w); }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">With this interface, <code>wait</code>'s implementation might look like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
          {
            return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
          }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bunused_007d-type-attribute-3918"></a>When attached to a type (including a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is often
the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually defined and then
not referenced, but contain constructors and destructors that have
nontrivial bookkeeping functions.

     <br><dt><code>visibility</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvisibility_007d-type-attribute-3919"></a>In C++, attribute visibility (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) can also be
applied to class, struct, union and enum types.  Unlike other type
attributes, the attribute must appear between the initial keyword and
the name of the type; it cannot appear after the body of the type.

     <p>Note that the type visibility is applied to vague linkage entities
associated with the class (vtable, typeinfo node, etc.).  In
particular, if a class is thrown as an exception in one shared object
and caught in another, the class must have default visibility. 
Otherwise the two shared objects are unable to use the same
typeinfo node and exception handling will break.

 <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007baltivec_007d-type-attribute_002c-PowerPC-3928"></a>The <code>altivec</code> attribute allows one to declare AltiVec vector data
types supported by the AltiVec Programming Interface Manual.  The
attribute requires an argument to specify one of three vector types:
<code>vector__</code>, <code>pixel__</code> (always followed by unsigned short),
and <code>bool__</code> (always followed by unsigned).

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((altivec(vector__)))
     __attribute__((altivec(pixel__))) unsigned short
     __attribute__((altivec(bool__))) unsigned
</pre>
 <p>These attributes mainly are intended to support the <code>__vector</code>,
<code>__pixel</code>, and <code>__bool</code> AltiVec keywords.

If <code>packed</code> is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used
it may be that the Microsoft ABI packs them differently
than GCC normally packs them.  Particularly when moving packed
data between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler
(either via function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access
either format.

<h3 class="section">6.34 Label Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-Label-Attributes-3932"></a>
GCC allows attributes to be set on C labels.  See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for
details of the exact syntax for using attributes.  Other attributes are
available for functions (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), variables
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>), enumerators (see <a href="#Enumerator-Attributes">Enumerator Attributes</a>),
statements (see <a href="#Statement-Attributes">Statement Attributes</a>), and for types
(see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

 <p>This example uses the <code>cold</code> label attribute to indicate the
<code>ErrorHandling</code> branch is unlikely to be taken and that the
<code>ErrorHandling</code> label is unused:

<pre class="smallexample">     
        asm goto ("some asm" : : : : NoError);
     
     /* This branch (the fall-through from the asm) is less commonly used */
     ErrorHandling:
        __attribute__((cold, unused)); /* Semi-colon is required here */
        printf("error\n");
        return 0;
     
     NoError:
        printf("no error\n");
        return 1;
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><code>unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bunused_007d-label-attribute-3933"></a>This feature is intended for program-generated code that may contain
unused labels, but which is compiled with <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  It is
not normally appropriate to use in it human-written code, though it
could be useful in cases where the code that jumps to the label is
contained within an <code>#ifdef</code> conditional.

     <br><dt><code>hot</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhot_007d-label-attribute-3934"></a>The <code>hot</code> attribute on a label is used to inform the compiler that
the path following the label is more likely than paths that are not so
annotated.  This attribute is used in cases where <code>__builtin_expect</code>
cannot be used, for instance with computed goto or <code>asm goto</code>.

     <br><dt><code>cold</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcold_007d-label-attribute-3935"></a>The <code>cold</code> attribute on labels is used to inform the compiler that

<h3 class="section">6.35 Enumerator Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-Enumerator-Attributes-3936"></a>
GCC allows attributes to be set on enumerators.  See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for
details of the exact syntax for using attributes.  Other attributes are
available for functions (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), variables
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>), labels (see <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>), statements
(see <a href="#Statement-Attributes">Statement Attributes</a>), and for types (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

 <p>This example uses the <code>deprecated</code> enumerator attribute to indicate the
<code>oldval</code> enumerator is deprecated:

<pre class="smallexample">     enum E {
       oldval __attribute__((deprecated)),
       newval
     };
     
     int
     fn (void)
     {

</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><code>deprecated</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-enumerator-attribute-3937"></a>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the enumerator
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
enumerators that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated enumerator, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the enumerator is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses.

<h3 class="section">6.36 Statement Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-Statement-Attributes-3938"></a>
GCC allows attributes to be set on null statements.  See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>,
for details of the exact syntax for using attributes.  Other attributes are
available for functions (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), variables
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>), labels (see <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>), enumerators
(see <a href="#Enumerator-Attributes">Enumerator Attributes</a>), and for types (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

 <p>This example uses the <code>fallthrough</code> statement attribute to indicate that
the <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-fallthrough</span></samp> warning should not be emitted:

<pre class="smallexample">     switch (cond)
       {
       case 1:
         bar (1);
         __attribute__((fallthrough));

</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><code>fallthrough</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfallthrough_007d-statement-attribute-3939"></a>The <code>fallthrough</code> attribute with a null statement serves as a
fallthrough statement.  It hints to the compiler that a statement
that falls through to another case label, or user-defined label
in a switch statement is intentional and thus the
<samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-fallthrough</span></samp> warning must not trigger.  The
fallthrough attribute may appear at most once in each attribute
list, and may not be mixed with other attributes.  It can only
be used in a switch statement (the compiler will issue an error
otherwise), after a preceding statement and before a logically
succeeding case label, or user-defined label.

<h3 class="section">6.37 Attribute Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-attribute-syntax-3940"></a>
This section describes the syntax with which <code>__attribute__</code> may be
used, and the constructs to which attribute specifiers bind, for the C
language.  Some details may vary for C++ and Objective-C.  Because of
infelicities in the grammar for attributes, some forms described here
may not be successfully parsed in all cases.

 <p>There are some problems with the semantics of attributes in C++.  For
example, there are no manglings for attributes, although they may affect
code generation, so problems may arise when attributed types are used in
conjunction with templates or overloading.  Similarly, <code>typeid</code>
does not distinguish between types with different attributes.  Support
for attributes in C++ may be restricted in future to attributes on
declarations only, but not on nested declarators.

 <p>See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to functions.  See <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>, for details of the
semantics of attributes applying to variables.  See <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>,
for details of the semantics of attributes applying to structure, union
and enumerated types. 
See <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to labels. 
See <a href="#Enumerator-Attributes">Enumerator Attributes</a>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to enumerators. 
See <a href="#Statement-Attributes">Statement Attributes</a>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to statements.

 <p>An <dfn>attribute specifier</dfn> is of the form
<code>__attribute__ ((</code><var>attribute-list</var><code>))</code>.  An <dfn>attribute list</dfn>
is a possibly empty comma-separated sequence of <dfn>attributes</dfn>, where
each attribute is one of the following:

     <ul>
<li>Empty.  Empty attributes are ignored.

     <li>An attribute name
(which may be an identifier such as <code>unused</code>, or a reserved
word such as <code>const</code>).

     <li>An attribute name followed by a parenthesized list of
parameters for the attribute. 
These parameters take one of the following forms:

          <ul>
<li>An identifier.  For example, <code>mode</code> attributes use this form.

          <li>An identifier followed by a comma and a non-empty comma-separated list
of expressions.  For example, <code>format</code> attributes use this form.

          <li>A possibly empty comma-separated list of expressions.  For example,
<code>format_arg</code> attributes use this form with the list being a single
integer constant expression, and <code>alias</code> attributes use this form
with the list being a single string constant. 
</ul>
     </ul>

 <p>An <dfn>attribute specifier list</dfn> is a sequence of one or more attribute
specifiers, not separated by any other tokens.

 <p>You may optionally specify attribute names with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;
preceding and following the name. 
This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use the attribute name <code>__noreturn__</code> instead of <code>noreturn</code>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Label Attributes</h5>

<p>In GNU C, an attribute specifier list may appear after the colon following a
label, other than a <code>case</code> or <code>default</code> label.  GNU C++ only permits
attributes on labels if the attribute specifier is immediately
followed by a semicolon (i.e., the label applies to an empty
statement).  If the semicolon is missing, C++ label attributes are
ambiguous, as it is permissible for a declaration, which could begin
with an attribute list, to be labelled in C++.  Declarations cannot be
labelled in C90 or C99, so the ambiguity does not arise there.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Enumerator Attributes</h5>

<p>In GNU C, an attribute specifier list may appear as part of an enumerator. 
The attribute goes after the enumeration constant, before <code>=</code>, if
present.  The optional attribute in the enumerator appertains to the
enumeration constant.  It is not possible to place the attribute after
the constant expression, if present.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Statement Attributes</h5>

<p>In GNU C, an attribute specifier list may appear as part of a null
statement.  The attribute goes before the semicolon.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Type Attributes</h5>

<p>An attribute specifier list may appear as part of a <code>struct</code>,
<code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> specifier.  It may go either immediately
after the <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> keyword, or after
the closing brace.  The former syntax is preferred. 
Where attribute specifiers follow the closing brace, they are considered
to relate to the structure, union or enumerated type defined, not to any
enclosing declaration the type specifier appears in, and the type
defined is not complete until after the attribute specifiers. 
<!-- Otherwise, there would be the following problems: a shift/reduce -->
<!-- conflict between attributes binding the struct/union/enum and -->
<!-- binding to the list of specifiers/qualifiers; and "aligned" -->
<!-- attributes could use sizeof for the structure, but the size could be -->
<!-- changed later by "packed" attributes. -->

<h5 class="subsubheading">All other attributes</h5>

<p>Otherwise, an attribute specifier appears as part of a declaration,
counting declarations of unnamed parameters and type names, and relates
to that declaration (which may be nested in another declaration, for
example in the case of a parameter declaration), or to a particular declarator
within a declaration.  Where an
attribute specifier is applied to a parameter declared as a function or
an array, it should apply to the function or array rather than the
pointer to which the parameter is implicitly converted, but this is not
yet correctly implemented.

 <p>Any list of specifiers and qualifiers at the start of a declaration may
contain attribute specifiers, whether or not such a list may in that
context contain storage class specifiers.  (Some attributes, however,
are essentially in the nature of storage class specifiers, and only make
sense where storage class specifiers may be used; for example,
<code>section</code>.)  There is one necessary limitation to this syntax: the
first old-style parameter declaration in a function definition cannot
begin with an attribute specifier, because such an attribute applies to
the function instead by syntax described below (which, however, is not
yet implemented in this case).  In some other cases, attribute
specifiers are permitted by this grammar but not yet supported by the
compiler.  All attribute specifiers in this place relate to the
declaration as a whole.  In the obsolescent usage where a type of
<code>int</code> is implied by the absence of type specifiers, such a list of
specifiers and qualifiers may be an attribute specifier list with no
other specifiers or qualifiers.

 <p>At present, the first parameter in a function prototype must have some
type specifier that is not an attribute specifier; this resolves an
ambiguity in the interpretation of <code>void f(int
(__attribute__((foo)) x))</code>, but is subject to change.  At present, if
the parentheses of a function declarator contain only attributes then
those attributes are ignored, rather than yielding an error or warning
or implying a single parameter of type int, but this is subject to
change.

 <p>An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before a declarator
(other than the first) in a comma-separated list of declarators in a
declaration of more than one identifier using a single list of
specifiers and qualifiers.  Such attribute specifiers apply
only to the identifier before whose declarator they appear.  For
example, in

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((noreturn)) void d0 (void),
         __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2))) d1 (const char *, ...),
          d2 (void);
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">the <code>noreturn</code> attribute applies to all the functions
declared; the <code>format</code> attribute only applies to <code>d1</code>.

 <p>An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before the comma,
<code>=</code> or semicolon terminating the declaration of an identifier other
than a function definition.  Such attribute specifiers apply
to the declared object or function.  Where an
assembler name for an object or function is specified (see <a href="#Asm-Labels">Asm Labels</a>), the attribute must follow the <code>asm</code>
specification.

 <p>An attribute specifier list may, in future, be permitted to appear after
the declarator in a function definition (before any old-style parameter
declarations or the function body).

 <p>Attribute specifiers may be mixed with type qualifiers appearing inside
the <code>[]</code> of a parameter array declarator, in the C99 construct by
which such qualifiers are applied to the pointer to which the array is
implicitly converted.  Such attribute specifiers apply to the pointer,
not to the array, but at present this is not implemented and they are
ignored.

 <p>An attribute specifier list may appear at the start of a nested
declarator.  At present, there are some limitations in this usage: the
attributes correctly apply to the declarator, but for most individual
attributes the semantics this implies are not implemented. 
When attribute specifiers follow the <code>*</code> of a pointer
declarator, they may be mixed with any type qualifiers present. 
The following describes the formal semantics of this syntax.  It makes the
most sense if you are familiar with the formal specification of
declarators in the ISO C standard.

 <p>Consider (as in C99 subclause 6.7.5 paragraph 4) a declaration <code>T
D1</code>, where <code>T</code> contains declaration specifiers that specify a type
<var>Type</var> (such as <code>int</code>) and <code>D1</code> is a declarator that
contains an identifier <var>ident</var>.  The type specified for <var>ident</var>
for derived declarators whose type does not include an attribute
specifier is as in the ISO C standard.

 <p>If <code>D1</code> has the form <code>( </code><var>attribute-specifier-list</var><code> D )</code>,
and the declaration <code>T D</code> specifies the type
&ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>, then
<code>T D1</code> specifies the type &ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var>
<var>attribute-specifier-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>.

 <p>If <code>D1</code> has the form <code>*
</code><var>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</var><code> D</code>, and the
declaration <code>T D</code> specifies the type
&ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>, then
<code>T D1</code> specifies the type &ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var>
<var>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</var> pointer to <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for
<var>ident</var>.

 <p>For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     void (__attribute__((noreturn)) ****f) (void);
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">specifies the type &ldquo;pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to
non-returning function returning <code>void</code>&rdquo;.  As another example,

<pre class="smallexample">     char *__attribute__((aligned(8))) *f;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">specifies the type &ldquo;pointer to 8-byte-aligned pointer to <code>char</code>&rdquo;. 
Note again that this does not work with most attributes; for example,
the usage of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aligned</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noreturn</span></samp>&rsquo; attributes given above
is not yet supported.

 <p>For compatibility with existing code written for compiler versions that
did not implement attributes on nested declarators, some laxity is
allowed in the placing of attributes.  If an attribute that only applies
to types is applied to a declaration, it is treated as applying to
the type of that declaration.  If an attribute that only applies to
declarations is applied to the type of a declaration, it is treated
as applying to that declaration; and, for compatibility with code
placing the attributes immediately before the identifier declared, such
an attribute applied to a function return type is treated as
applying to the function type, and such an attribute applied to an array
element type is treated as applying to the array type.  If an
attribute that only applies to function types is applied to a
pointer-to-function type, it is treated as applying to the pointer
target type; if such an attribute is applied to a function return type
that is not a pointer-to-function type, it is treated as applying
to the function type.

GNU C extends ISO C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:

<pre class="smallexample">     /* <span class="roman">Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.</span>  */
     #ifdef __STDC__
     #define P(x) x
     #else
     #define P(x) ()
     #endif
     
     /* <span class="roman">Prototype function declaration.</span>  */
     int isroot P((uid_t));
     
     /* <span class="roman">Old-style function definition.</span>  */
     int
     isroot (x)   /* <span class="roman">??? lossage here ???</span> */
          uid_t x;
     {
       return x == 0;
     }
</pre>
 <p>Suppose the type <code>uid_t</code> happens to be <code>short</code>.  ISO C does
not allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an <code>int</code>, which does not
match the prototype argument type of <code>short</code>.

 <p>This restriction of ISO C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know
whether the <code>uid_t</code> type is <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, or
<code>long</code>.  Therefore, in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype
to override a later old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a
function prototype argument type overrides the argument type specified
by a later old-style definition if the former type is the same as the
latter type before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is
equivalent to the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     int isroot (uid_t);
     
     int
     isroot (uid_t x)
     {
       return x == 0;
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.

In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo; and
continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
such comments, and they are included in the 1999 C standard.  However,
C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify an <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp>

In GNU C, you may normally use dollar signs in identifier names. 
This is because many traditional C implementations allow such identifiers. 
However, dollar signs in identifiers are not supported on a few target
machines, typically because the target assembler does not allow them.

<p><a name="index-alignment-3950"></a><a name="index-type-alignment-3951"></a><a name="index-variable-alignment-3952"></a>
The keyword <code>__alignof__</code> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <code>sizeof</code>.

 <p>For example, if the target machine requires a <code>double</code> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 8. 
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 4 or even 2.

 <p>Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd address.  For these machines, <code>__alignof__</code>
reports the smallest alignment that GCC gives the data type, usually as
mandated by the target ABI.

 <p>If the operand of <code>__alignof__</code> is an lvalue rather than a type,
its value is the required alignment for its type, taking into account
any minimum alignment specified with GCC's <code>__attribute__</code>
extension (see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).  For example, after this
declaration:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">the value of <code>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</code> is 1, even though its actual
alignment is probably 2 or 4, the same as <code>__alignof__ (int)</code>.

 <p>It is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type.

<h3 class="section">6.43 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</h3>

<p><a name="index-inline-functions-3953"></a><a name="index-integrating-function-code-3954"></a><a name="index-open-coding-3955"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-inline-alternative-3956"></a>
By declaring a function inline, you can direct GCC to make
calls to that function faster.  One way GCC can achieve this is to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their
known values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not
all of the inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on
code size is less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller
with function inlining, depending on the particular case.  You can
also direct GCC to try to integrate all &ldquo;simple enough&rdquo; functions
into their callers with the option <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>.

 <p>GCC implements three different semantics of declaring a function
inline.  One is available with <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu89</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span></samp> or when <code>gnu_inline</code> attribute is present
on all inline declarations, another when
<samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp> or an option for a later C version is used
(without <samp><span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span></samp>), and the third
is used when compiling C++.

 <p>To declare a function inline, use the <code>inline</code> keyword in its
declaration, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     static inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       return (*a)++;
     }
</pre>
 <p>If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C90 programs, write
<code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.  See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

 <p>The three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases:
when the <code>inline</code> keyword is used on a <code>static</code> function,
like the example above, and when a function is first declared without
using the <code>inline</code> keyword and then is defined with
<code>inline</code>, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern int inc (int *a);
     inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       return (*a)++;
     }
</pre>
 <p>In both of these common cases, the program behaves the same as if you
had not used the <code>inline</code> keyword, except for its speed.

 <p><a name="index-inline-functions_002c-omission-of-3957"></a><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-3958"></a>When a function is both inline and <code>static</code>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced. 
In this case, GCC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp>. 
If there is a nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to
assembler code as usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if
the program refers to its address, because that cannot be inlined.

 <p><a name="index-Winline-3959"></a>Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it unsuitable
for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: variadic functions,
use of <code>alloca</code>, use of computed goto (see <a href="#Labels-as-Values">Labels as Values</a>),
use of nonlocal goto, use of nested functions, use of <code>setjmp</code>, use
of <code>__builtin_longjmp</code> and use of <code>__builtin_return</code> or
<code>__builtin_apply_args</code>.  Using <samp><span class="option">-Winline</span></samp> warns when a
function marked <code>inline</code> could not be substituted, and gives the
reason for the failure.

 <p><a name="index-automatic-_0040code_007binline_007d-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-3960"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binline_007d-automatic-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-3961"></a><a name="index-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-3962"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-3963"></a><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-3964"></a>As required by ISO C++, GCC considers member functions defined within
the body of a class to be marked inline even if they are
not explicitly declared with the <code>inline</code> keyword.  You can
override this with <samp><span class="option">-fno-default-inline</span></samp>; see <a href="#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>.

 <p>GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">always_inline</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute for the function, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     /* <span class="roman">Prototype.</span>  */
     inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));
</pre>
 <p>The remainder of this section is specific to GNU C90 inlining.

 <p><a name="index-non_002dstatic-inline-function-3965"></a>When an inline function is not <code>static</code>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated. 
Therefore, a non-<code>static</code> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.

 <p>If you specify both <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

 <p>This combination of <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code>) in a library file. 
The definition in the header file causes most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they refer to
the single copy in the library.

<h3 class="section">6.44 When is a Volatile Object Accessed?</h3>

<p><a name="index-accessing-volatiles-3966"></a><a name="index-volatile-read-3967"></a><a name="index-volatile-write-3968"></a><a name="index-volatile-access-3969"></a>
C has the concept of volatile objects.  These are normally accessed by
pointers and used for accessing hardware or inter-thread
communication.  The standard encourages compilers to refrain from
optimizations concerning accesses to volatile objects, but leaves it
implementation defined as to what constitutes a volatile access.  The
minimum requirement is that at a sequence point all previous accesses
to volatile objects have stabilized and no subsequent accesses have
occurred.  Thus an implementation is free to reorder and combine
volatile accesses that occur between sequence points, but cannot do
so for accesses across a sequence point.  The use of volatile does
not allow you to violate the restriction on updating objects multiple
times between two sequence points.

 <p>Accesses to non-volatile objects are not ordered with respect to
volatile accesses.  You cannot use a volatile object as a memory
barrier to order a sequence of writes to non-volatile memory.  For
instance:

<pre class="smallexample">     int *ptr = <var>something</var>;
     volatile int vobj;
     *ptr = <var>something</var>;
     vobj = 1;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Unless <var>*ptr</var> and <var>vobj</var> can be aliased, it is not guaranteed
that the write to <var>*ptr</var> occurs by the time the update
of <var>vobj</var> happens.  If you need this guarantee, you must use
a stronger memory barrier such as:

<pre class="smallexample">     int *ptr = <var>something</var>;
     volatile int vobj;
     *ptr = <var>something</var>;
     asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
     vobj = 1;
</pre>
 <p>A scalar volatile object is read when it is accessed in a void context:

<pre class="smallexample">     volatile int *src = <var>somevalue</var>;
     *src;
</pre>
 <p>Such expressions are rvalues, and GCC implements this as a
read of the volatile object being pointed to.

 <p>Assignments are also expressions and have an rvalue.  However when
assigning to a scalar volatile, the volatile object is not reread,
regardless of whether the assignment expression's rvalue is used or
not.  If the assignment's rvalue is used, the value is that assigned
to the volatile object.  For instance, there is no read of <var>vobj</var>
in all the following cases:

<pre class="smallexample">     int obj;
     volatile int vobj;
     vobj = <var>something</var>;
     obj = vobj = <var>something</var>;
     obj ? vobj = <var>onething</var> : vobj = <var>anotherthing</var>;
     obj = (<var>something</var>, vobj = <var>anotherthing</var>);
</pre>
 <p>If you need to read the volatile object after an assignment has
occurred, you must use a separate expression with an intervening
sequence point.

 <p>As bit-fields are not individually addressable, volatile bit-fields may
be implicitly read when written to, or when adjacent bit-fields are
accessed.  Bit-field operations may be optimized such that adjacent
bit-fields are only partially accessed, if they straddle a storage unit
boundary.  For these reasons it is unwise to use volatile bit-fields to
access hardware.

The <code>asm</code> keyword allows you to embed assembler instructions
within C code.  GCC provides two forms of inline <code>asm</code>
statements.  A <dfn>basic </dfn><code>asm</code> statement is one with no
operands (see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>), while an <dfn>extended </dfn><code>asm</code>
statement (see <a href="#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>) includes one or more operands. 
The extended form is preferred for mixing C and assembly language
within a function, but to include assembly language at
top level you must use basic <code>asm</code>.

 <p>You can also use the <code>asm</code> keyword to override the assembler name
for a C symbol, or to place a C variable in a specific register.

<p><a name="index-basic-_0040code_007basm_007d-3974"></a><a name="index-assembly-language-in-C_002c-basic-3975"></a>
A basic <code>asm</code> statement has the following syntax:

<pre class="example">     asm <var>asm-qualifiers</var> ( <var>AssemblerInstructions</var> )
</pre>
 <p>The <code>asm</code> keyword is a GNU extension. 
When writing code that can be compiled with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> and the
various <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options, use <code>__asm__</code> instead of
<code>asm</code> (see <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Qualifiers</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>volatile</code><dd>The optional <code>volatile</code> qualifier has no effect. 
All basic <code>asm</code> blocks are implicitly volatile.

     <br><dt><code>inline</code><dd>If you use the <code>inline</code> qualifier, then for inlining purposes the size
of the asm is taken as the smallest size possible (see <a href="#Size-of-an-asm">Size of an asm</a>). 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Parameters</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><var>AssemblerInstructions</var><dd>This is a literal string that specifies the assembler code. The string can
contain any instructions recognized by the assembler, including directives. 
GCC does not parse the assembler instructions themselves and
does not know what they mean or even whether they are valid assembler input.

     <p>You may place multiple assembler instructions together in a single <code>asm</code>
string, separated by the characters normally used in assembly code for the
system. A combination that works in most places is a newline to break the
line, plus a tab character (written as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n\t</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Some assemblers allow semicolons as a line separator. However,
note that some assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Remarks</h5>

<p>Using extended <code>asm</code> (see <a href="#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>) typically produces
smaller, safer, and more efficient code, and in most cases it is a
better solution than basic <code>asm</code>.  However, there are two
situations where only basic <code>asm</code> can be used:

     <ul>
<li>Extended <code>asm</code> statements have to be inside a C
function, so to write inline assembly language at file scope (&ldquo;top-level&rdquo;),
outside of C functions, you must use basic <code>asm</code>. 
You can use this technique to emit assembler directives,
define assembly language macros that can be invoked elsewhere in the file,
or write entire functions in assembly language.

     <li>Functions declared
with the <code>naked</code> attribute also require basic <code>asm</code>
(see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>). 
</ul>

 <p>Safely accessing C data and calling functions from basic <code>asm</code> is more
complex than it may appear. To access C data, it is better to use extended
<code>asm</code>.

 <p>Do not expect a sequence of <code>asm</code> statements to remain perfectly
consecutive after compilation. If certain instructions need to remain
consecutive in the output, put them in a single multi-instruction <code>asm</code>
statement. Note that GCC's optimizers can move <code>asm</code> statements
relative to other code, including across jumps.

 <p><code>asm</code> statements may not perform jumps into other <code>asm</code> statements. 
GCC does not know about these jumps, and therefore cannot take
account of them when deciding how to optimize. Jumps from <code>asm</code> to C
labels are only supported in extended <code>asm</code>.

 <p>Under certain circumstances, GCC may duplicate (or remove duplicates of) your
assembly code when optimizing. This can lead to unexpected duplicate
symbol errors during compilation if your assembly code defines symbols or
labels.

 <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The C standards do not specify semantics for <code>asm</code>,
making it a potential source of incompatibilities between compilers.  These
incompatibilities may not produce compiler warnings/errors.

 <p>GCC does not parse basic <code>asm</code>'s <var>AssemblerInstructions</var>, which
means there is no way to communicate to the compiler what is happening
inside them.  GCC has no visibility of symbols in the <code>asm</code> and may
discard them as unreferenced.  It also does not know about side effects of
the assembler code, such as modifications to memory or registers.  Unlike
some compilers, GCC assumes that no changes to general purpose registers
occur.  This assumption may change in a future release.

 <p>To avoid complications from future changes to the semantics and the
compatibility issues between compilers, consider replacing basic <code>asm</code>
with extended <code>asm</code>.  See
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/ConvertBasicAsmToExtended">How to convert from basic asm to extended asm</a> for information about how to perform this
conversion.

 <p>The compiler copies the assembler instructions in a basic <code>asm</code>
verbatim to the assembly language output file, without
processing dialects or any of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; operators that are available with
extended <code>asm</code>. This results in minor differences between basic
<code>asm</code> strings and extended <code>asm</code> templates. For example, to refer to
registers you might use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%eax</span></samp>&rsquo; in basic <code>asm</code> and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%eax</span></samp>&rsquo; in extended <code>asm</code>.

 <p>On targets such as x86 that support multiple assembler dialects,
all basic <code>asm</code> blocks use the assembler dialect specified by the
<samp><span class="option">-masm</span></samp> command-line option (see <a href="#x86-Options">x86 Options</a>). 
Basic <code>asm</code> provides no
mechanism to provide different assembler strings for different dialects.

 <p>For basic <code>asm</code> with non-empty assembler string GCC assumes
the assembler block does not change any general purpose registers,
but it may read or write any globally accessible variable.

 <p>Here is an example of basic <code>asm</code> for i386:

<pre class="example">     /* Note that this code will not compile with -masm=intel */
     #define DebugBreak() asm("int $3")

With extended <code>asm</code> you can read and write C variables from
assembler and perform jumps from assembler code to C labels. 
Extended <code>asm</code> syntax uses colons (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) to delimit
the operand parameters after the assembler template:

<pre class="example">     asm <var>asm-qualifiers</var> ( <var>AssemblerTemplate</var>

</pre>
 <p>where in the last form, <var>asm-qualifiers</var> contains <code>goto</code> (and in the

 <p>The <code>asm</code> keyword is a GNU extension. 
When writing code that can be compiled with <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> and the

</dl>

 <p>The total number of input + output + goto operands is limited to 30.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Remarks</h5>

<p>The <code>asm</code> statement allows you to include assembly instructions directly
within C code. This may help you to maximize performance in time-sensitive
code or to access assembly instructions that are not readily available to C
programs.

 <p>Note that extended <code>asm</code> statements must be inside a function. Only
basic <code>asm</code> may be outside functions (see <a href="#Basic-Asm">Basic Asm</a>). 
Functions declared with the <code>naked</code> attribute also require basic
<code>asm</code> (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

 <p>While the uses of <code>asm</code> are many and varied, it may help to think of an
<code>asm</code> statement as a series of low-level instructions that convert input
parameters to output parameters. So a simple (if not particularly useful)
example for i386 using <code>asm</code> might look like this:

<pre class="example">     int src = 1;
     int dst;
     
     asm ("mov %1, %0\n\t"
         "add $1, %0"
         : "=r" (dst)
         : "r" (src));
     
     printf("%d\n", dst);
</pre>
 <p>This code copies <code>src</code> to <code>dst</code> and add 1 to <code>dst</code>.

 <p><a name="Volatile"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.1 Volatile</h5>

<p><a name="index-volatile-_0040code_007basm_007d-3978"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-volatile-3979"></a>
GCC's optimizers sometimes discard <code>asm</code> statements if they determine
there is no need for the output variables. Also, the optimizers may move
code out of loops if they believe that the code will always return the same
result (i.e. none of its input values change between calls). Using the
<code>volatile</code> qualifier disables these optimizations. <code>asm</code> statements
that have no output operands, including <code>asm goto</code> statements,
are implicitly volatile.

 <p>This i386 code demonstrates a case that does not use (or require) the
<code>volatile</code> qualifier. If it is performing assertion checking, this code
uses <code>asm</code> to perform the validation. Otherwise, <code>dwRes</code> is
unreferenced by any code. As a result, the optimizers can discard the
<code>asm</code> statement, which in turn removes the need for the entire
<code>DoCheck</code> routine. By omitting the <code>volatile</code> qualifier when it
isn't needed you allow the optimizers to produce the most efficient code
possible.

<pre class="example">     void DoCheck(uint32_t dwSomeValue)
     {
        uint32_t dwRes;
     
        // Assumes dwSomeValue is not zero.
        asm ("bsfl %1,%0"
          : "=r" (dwRes)
          : "r" (dwSomeValue)
          : "cc");
     
        assert(dwRes &gt; 3);
     }
</pre>
 <p>The next example shows a case where the optimizers can recognize that the input
(<code>dwSomeValue</code>) never changes during the execution of the function and can
therefore move the <code>asm</code> outside the loop to produce more efficient code. 
Again, using <code>volatile</code> disables this type of optimization.

<pre class="example">     void do_print(uint32_t dwSomeValue)
     {
        uint32_t dwRes;
     
        for (uint32_t x=0; x &lt; 5; x++)
        {
           // Assumes dwSomeValue is not zero.
           asm ("bsfl %1,%0"
             : "=r" (dwRes)
             : "r" (dwSomeValue)
             : "cc");
     
           printf("%u: %u %u\n", x, dwSomeValue, dwRes);
        }
     }
</pre>
 <p>The following example demonstrates a case where you need to use the
<code>volatile</code> qualifier. 
It uses the x86 <code>rdtsc</code> instruction, which reads
the computer's time-stamp counter. Without the <code>volatile</code> qualifier,
the optimizers might assume that the <code>asm</code> block will always return the
same value and therefore optimize away the second call.

<pre class="example">     uint64_t msr;
     
     asm volatile ( "rdtsc\n\t"    // Returns the time in EDX:EAX.
             "shl $32, %%rdx\n\t"  // Shift the upper bits left.
             "or %%rdx, %0"        // 'Or' in the lower bits.
             : "=a" (msr)
             :
             : "rdx");
     
     printf("msr: %llx\n", msr);
     
     // Do other work...
     
     // Reprint the timestamp
     asm volatile ( "rdtsc\n\t"    // Returns the time in EDX:EAX.
             "shl $32, %%rdx\n\t"  // Shift the upper bits left.
             "or %%rdx, %0"        // 'Or' in the lower bits.
             : "=a" (msr)
             :
             : "rdx");
     
     printf("msr: %llx\n", msr);
</pre>
 <p>GCC's optimizers do not treat this code like the non-volatile code in the
earlier examples. They do not move it out of loops or omit it on the
assumption that the result from a previous call is still valid.

 <p>Note that the compiler can move even volatile <code>asm</code> instructions relative
to other code, including across jump instructions. For example, on many
targets there is a system register that controls the rounding mode of
floating-point operations. Setting it with a volatile <code>asm</code>, as in the
following PowerPC example, does not work reliably.

<pre class="example">     asm volatile("mtfsf 255, %0" : : "f" (fpenv));
     sum = x + y;
</pre>
 <p>The compiler may move the addition back before the volatile <code>asm</code>. To
make it work as expected, add an artificial dependency to the <code>asm</code> by
referencing a variable in the subsequent code, for example:

<pre class="example">     asm volatile ("mtfsf 255,%1" : "=X" (sum) : "f" (fpenv));
     sum = x + y;
</pre>
 <p>Under certain circumstances, GCC may duplicate (or remove duplicates of) your
assembly code when optimizing. This can lead to unexpected duplicate symbol
errors during compilation if your asm code defines symbols or labels. 
Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%=</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#AssemblerTemplate">AssemblerTemplate</a>) may help resolve this problem.

 <p><a name="AssemblerTemplate"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.2 Assembler Template</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-assembler-template-3980"></a>
An assembler template is a literal string containing assembler instructions. 
The compiler replaces tokens in the template that refer
to inputs, outputs, and goto labels,
and then outputs the resulting string to the assembler. The
string can contain any instructions recognized by the assembler, including
directives. GCC does not parse the assembler instructions
themselves and does not know what they mean or even whether they are valid
assembler input. However, it does count the statements
(see <a href="#Size-of-an-asm">Size of an asm</a>).

 <p>You may place multiple assembler instructions together in a single <code>asm</code>
string, separated by the characters normally used in assembly code for the
system. A combination that works in most places is a newline to break the
line, plus a tab character to move to the instruction field (written as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n\t</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Some assemblers allow semicolons as a line separator. However, note
that some assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment.

 <p>Do not expect a sequence of <code>asm</code> statements to remain perfectly
consecutive after compilation, even when you are using the <code>volatile</code>
qualifier. If certain instructions need to remain consecutive in the output,
put them in a single multi-instruction asm statement.

 <p>Accessing data from C programs without using input/output operands (such as
by using global symbols directly from the assembler template) may not work as
expected. Similarly, calling functions directly from an assembler template
requires a detailed understanding of the target assembler and ABI.

 <p>Since GCC does not parse the assembler template,
it has no visibility of any
symbols it references. This may result in GCC discarding those symbols as
unreferenced unless they are also listed as input, output, or goto operands.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Special format strings</h5>

<p>In addition to the tokens described by the input, output, and goto operands,
these tokens have special meanings in the assembler template:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Outputs a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; into the assembler code.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%=</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Outputs a number that is unique to each instance of the <code>asm</code>
statement in the entire compilation. This option is useful when creating local
labels and referring to them multiple times in a single template that
generates multiple assembler instructions.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%{</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%|</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%}</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Outputs &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo; characters (respectively)
into the assembler code.  When unescaped, these characters have special
meaning to indicate multiple assembler dialects, as described below. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Multiple assembler dialects in <code>asm</code> templates</h5>

<p>On targets such as x86, GCC supports multiple assembler dialects. 
The <samp><span class="option">-masm</span></samp> option controls which dialect GCC uses as its
default for inline assembler. The target-specific documentation for the
<samp><span class="option">-masm</span></samp> option contains the list of supported dialects, as well as the
default dialect if the option is not specified. This information may be
important to understand, since assembler code that works correctly when
compiled using one dialect will likely fail if compiled using another. 
See <a href="#x86-Options">x86 Options</a>.

 <p>If your code needs to support multiple assembler dialects (for example, if
you are writing public headers that need to support a variety of compilation
options), use constructs of this form:

<pre class="example">     { dialect0 | dialect1 | dialect2... }
</pre>
 <p>This construct outputs <code>dialect0</code>
when using dialect #0 to compile the code,
<code>dialect1</code> for dialect #1, etc. If there are fewer alternatives within the
braces than the number of dialects the compiler supports, the construct
outputs nothing.

 <p>For example, if an x86 compiler supports two dialects
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">att</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">intel</span></samp>&rsquo;), an
assembler template such as this:

<pre class="example">     "bt{l %[Offset],%[Base] | %[Base],%[Offset]}; jc %l2"
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">is equivalent to one of

<pre class="example">     "btl %[Offset],%[Base] ; jc %l2"   <span class="roman">/* att dialect */</span>
     "bt %[Base],%[Offset]; jc %l2"     <span class="roman">/* intel dialect */</span>
</pre>
 <p>Using that same compiler, this code:

<pre class="example">     "xchg{l}\t{%%}ebx, %1"
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">corresponds to either

<pre class="example">     "xchgl\t%%ebx, %1"                 <span class="roman">/* att dialect */</span>
     "xchg\tebx, %1"                    <span class="roman">/* intel dialect */</span>
</pre>
 <p>There is no support for nesting dialect alternatives.

 <p><a name="OutputOperands"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.3 Output Operands</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-output-operands-3981"></a>
An <code>asm</code> statement has zero or more output operands indicating the names
of C variables modified by the assembler code.

 <p>In this i386 example, <code>old</code> (referred to in the template string as
<code>%0</code>) and <code>*Base</code> (as <code>%1</code>) are outputs and <code>Offset</code>
(<code>%2</code>) is an input:

<pre class="example">     bool old;
     
     __asm__ ("btsl %2,%1\n\t" // Turn on zero-based bit #Offset in Base.
              "sbb %0,%0"      // Use the CF to calculate old.
        : "=r" (old), "+rm" (*Base)
        : "Ir" (Offset)
        : "cc");
     
     return old;
</pre>
 <p>Operands are separated by commas.  Each operand has this format:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">[</span> [<var>asmSymbolicName</var>] <span class="roman">]</span> <var>constraint</var> (<var>cvariablename</var>)
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><var>asmSymbolicName</var><dd>Specifies a symbolic name for the operand. 
Reference the name in the assembler template
by enclosing it in square brackets
(i.e. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%[Value]</span></samp>&rsquo;). The scope of the name is the <code>asm</code> statement
that contains the definition. Any valid C variable name is acceptable,
including names already defined in the surrounding code. No two operands
within the same <code>asm</code> statement can use the same symbolic name.

     <p>When not using an <var>asmSymbolicName</var>, use the (zero-based) position
of the operand
in the list of operands in the assembler template. For example if there are
three output operands, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%0</span></samp>&rsquo; in the template to refer to the first,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%1</span></samp>&rsquo; for the second, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%2</span></samp>&rsquo; for the third.

     <br><dt><var>constraint</var><dd>A string constant specifying constraints on the placement of the operand;
See <a href="#Constraints">Constraints</a>, for details.

     <p>Output constraints must begin with either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; (a variable overwriting an
existing value) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (when reading and writing). When using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;, do not assume the location contains the existing value
on entry to the <code>asm</code>, except
when the operand is tied to an input; see <a href="#InputOperands">Input Operands</a>.

     <p>After the prefix, there must be one or more additional constraints
(see <a href="#Constraints">Constraints</a>) that describe where the value resides. Common
constraints include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; for register and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; for memory. 
When you list more than one possible location (for example, <code>"=rm"</code>),
the compiler chooses the most efficient one based on the current context. 
If you list as many alternates as the <code>asm</code> statement allows, you permit
the optimizers to produce the best possible code. 
If you must use a specific register, but your Machine Constraints do not
provide sufficient control to select the specific register you want,
local register variables may provide a solution (see <a href="#Local-Register-Variables">Local Register Variables</a>).

     <br><dt><var>cvariablename</var><dd>Specifies a C lvalue expression to hold the output, typically a variable name. 
The enclosing parentheses are a required part of the syntax.

 </dl>

 <p>When the compiler selects the registers to use to
represent the output operands, it does not use any of the clobbered registers
(see <a href="#Clobbers-and-Scratch-Registers">Clobbers and Scratch Registers</a>).

 <p>Output operand expressions must be lvalues. The compiler cannot check whether
the operands have data types that are reasonable for the instruction being
executed. For output expressions that are not directly addressable (for
example a bit-field), the constraint must allow a register. In that case, GCC
uses the register as the output of the <code>asm</code>, and then stores that
register into the output.

 <p>Operands using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint modifier count as two operands
(that is, both as input and output) towards the total maximum of 30 operands
per <code>asm</code> statement.

 <p>Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint modifier (see <a href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a>) on all output
operands that must not overlap an input.  Otherwise,
GCC may allocate the output operand in the same register as an unrelated
input operand, on the assumption that the assembler code consumes its
inputs before producing outputs. This assumption may be false if the assembler
code actually consists of more than one instruction.

 <p>The same problem can occur if one output parameter (<var>a</var>) allows a register
constraint and another output parameter (<var>b</var>) allows a memory constraint. 
The code generated by GCC to access the memory address in <var>b</var> can contain
registers which <em>might</em> be shared by <var>a</var>, and GCC considers those
registers to be inputs to the asm. As above, GCC assumes that such input
registers are consumed before any outputs are written. This assumption may
result in incorrect behavior if the asm writes to <var>a</var> before using
<var>b</var>. Combining the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; modifier with the register constraint on <var>a</var>
ensures that modifying <var>a</var> does not affect the address referenced by
<var>b</var>. Otherwise, the location of <var>b</var>
is undefined if <var>a</var> is modified before using <var>b</var>.

 <p><code>asm</code> supports operand modifiers on operands (for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%k2</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead of simply &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%2</span></samp>&rsquo;). Typically these qualifiers are hardware
dependent. The list of supported modifiers for x86 is found at
<a href="#x86Operandmodifiers">x86 Operand modifiers</a>.

 <p>If the C code that follows the <code>asm</code> makes no use of any of the output
operands, use <code>volatile</code> for the <code>asm</code> statement to prevent the
optimizers from discarding the <code>asm</code> statement as unneeded
(see <a href="#Volatile">Volatile</a>).

 <p>This code makes no use of the optional <var>asmSymbolicName</var>. Therefore it
references the first output operand as <code>%0</code> (were there a second, it
would be <code>%1</code>, etc). The number of the first input operand is one greater
than that of the last output operand. In this i386 example, that makes
<code>Mask</code> referenced as <code>%1</code>:

<pre class="example">     uint32_t Mask = 1234;
     uint32_t Index;
     
       asm ("bsfl %1, %0"
          : "=r" (Index)
          : "r" (Mask)
          : "cc");
</pre>
 <p>That code overwrites the variable <code>Index</code> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;),
placing the value in a register (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Using the generic &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint instead of a constraint for a specific
register allows the compiler to pick the register to use, which can result
in more efficient code. This may not be possible if an assembler instruction
requires a specific register.

 <p>The following i386 example uses the <var>asmSymbolicName</var> syntax. 
It produces the
same result as the code above, but some may consider it more readable or more
maintainable since reordering index numbers is not necessary when adding or
removing operands. The names <code>aIndex</code> and <code>aMask</code>
are only used in this example to emphasize which
names get used where. 
It is acceptable to reuse the names <code>Index</code> and <code>Mask</code>.

<pre class="example">     uint32_t Mask = 1234;
     uint32_t Index;
     
       asm ("bsfl %[aMask], %[aIndex]"
          : [aIndex] "=r" (Index)
          : [aMask] "r" (Mask)
          : "cc");
</pre>
 <p>Here are some more examples of output operands.

<pre class="example">     uint32_t c = 1;
     uint32_t d;
     uint32_t *e = &amp;c;
     
     asm ("mov %[e], %[d]"
        : [d] "=rm" (d)
        : [e] "rm" (*e));
</pre>
 <p>Here, <code>d</code> may either be in a register or in memory. Since the compiler
might already have the current value of the <code>uint32_t</code> location
pointed to by <code>e</code>
in a register, you can enable it to choose the best location
for <code>d</code> by specifying both constraints.

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-flag-output-operands-3982"></a>
Some targets have a special register that holds the &ldquo;flags&rdquo; for the
result of an operation or comparison.  Normally, the contents of that
register are either unmodifed by the asm, or the asm is considered to
clobber the contents.

 <p>On some targets, a special form of output operand exists by which
conditions in the flags register may be outputs of the asm.  The set of
conditions supported are target specific, but the general rule is that
the output variable must be a scalar integer, and the value is boolean. 
When supported, the target defines the preprocessor symbol
<code>__GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__</code>.

 <p>Because of the special nature of the flag output operands, the constraint
may not include alternatives.

 <p>Most often, the target has only one flags register, and thus is an implied
operand of many instructions.  In this case, the operand should not be
referenced within the assembler template via <code>%0</code> etc, as there's
no corresponding text in the assembly language.

     <p>Input constraint strings may not begin with either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
When you list more than one possible location (for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"irm"</span></samp>&rsquo;),
the compiler chooses the most efficient one based on the current context. 
If you must use a specific register, but your Machine Constraints do not
provide sufficient control to select the specific register you want,
local register variables may provide a solution (see <a href="#Local-Register-Variables">Local Register Variables</a>).

     <p>Input constraints can also be digits (for example, <code>"0"</code>). This indicates
that the specified input must be in the same place as the output constraint
at the (zero-based) index in the output constraint list. 
When using <var>asmSymbolicName</var> syntax for the output operands,
you may use these names (enclosed in brackets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;) instead of digits.

     <br><dt><var>cexpression</var><dd>This is the C variable or expression being passed to the <code>asm</code> statement
as input.  The enclosing parentheses are a required part of the syntax.

 </dl>

 <p>When the compiler selects the registers to use to represent the input
operands, it does not use any of the clobbered registers
(see <a href="#Clobbers-and-Scratch-Registers">Clobbers and Scratch Registers</a>).

 <p>If there are no output operands but there are input operands, place two
consecutive colons where the output operands would go:

<pre class="example">     __asm__ ("some instructions"
        : /* No outputs. */
        : "r" (Offset / 8));
</pre>
 <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do <em>not</em> modify the contents of input-only operands
(except for inputs tied to outputs). The compiler assumes that on exit from
the <code>asm</code> statement these operands contain the same values as they
had before executing the statement. 
It is <em>not</em> possible to use clobbers
to inform the compiler that the values in these inputs are changing. One
common work-around is to tie the changing input variable to an output variable
that never gets used. Note, however, that if the code that follows the
<code>asm</code> statement makes no use of any of the output operands, the GCC
optimizers may discard the <code>asm</code> statement as unneeded
(see <a href="#Volatile">Volatile</a>).

 <p><code>asm</code> supports operand modifiers on operands (for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%k2</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead of simply &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%2</span></samp>&rsquo;). Typically these qualifiers are hardware
dependent. The list of supported modifiers for x86 is found at
<a href="#x86Operandmodifiers">x86 Operand modifiers</a>.

 <p>In this example using the fictitious <code>combine</code> instruction, the
constraint <code>"0"</code> for input operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
location as output operand 0. Only input operands may use numbers in
constraints, and they must each refer to an output operand. Only a number (or
the symbolic assembler name) in the constraint can guarantee that one operand
is in the same place as another. The mere fact that <code>foo</code> is the value of
both operands is not enough to guarantee that they are in the same place in
the generated assembler code.

<pre class="example">     asm ("combine %2, %0"
        : "=r" (foo)
        : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre>
 <p>Here is an example using symbolic names.

<pre class="example">     asm ("cmoveq %1, %2, %[result]"
        : [result] "=r"(result)
        : "r" (test), "r" (new), "[result]" (old));

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.6 Clobbers and Scratch Registers</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-clobbers-3985"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-scratch-registers-3986"></a>
While the compiler is aware of changes to entries listed in the output
operands, the inline <code>asm</code> code may modify more than just the outputs. For
example, calculations may require additional registers, or the processor may
overwrite a register as a side effect of a particular assembler instruction. 
In order to inform the compiler of these changes, list them in the clobber
list. Clobber list items are either register names or the special clobbers
(listed below). Each clobber list item is a string constant
enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas.

 <p>Clobber descriptions may not in any way overlap with an input or output
operand. For example, you may not have an operand describing a register class
with one member when listing that register in the clobber list. Variables
declared to live in specific registers (see <a href="#Explicit-Register-Variables">Explicit Register Variables</a>) and used
as <code>asm</code> input or output operands must have no part mentioned in the
clobber description. In particular, there is no way to specify that input
operands get modified without also specifying them as output operands.

 <p>When the compiler selects which registers to use to represent input and output
operands, it does not use any of the clobbered registers. As a result,
clobbered registers are available for any use in the assembler code.

 <p>Here is a realistic example for the VAX showing the use of clobbered
registers:

<pre class="example">     asm volatile ("movc3 %0, %1, %2"
                        : /* No outputs. */
                        : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                        : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5", "memory");
</pre>
 <p>Also, there are two special clobber arguments:

     <dl>
<dt><code>"cc"</code><dd>The <code>"cc"</code> clobber indicates that the assembler code modifies the flags
register. On some machines, GCC represents the condition codes as a specific
hardware register; <code>"cc"</code> serves to name this register. 
On other machines, condition code handling is different,
and specifying <code>"cc"</code> has no effect. But
it is valid no matter what the target.

     <br><dt><code>"memory"</code><dd>The <code>"memory"</code> clobber tells the compiler that the assembly code
performs memory
reads or writes to items other than those listed in the input and output
operands (for example, accessing the memory pointed to by one of the input
parameters). To ensure memory contains correct values, GCC may need to flush
specific register values to memory before executing the <code>asm</code>. Further,
the compiler does not assume that any values read from memory before an
<code>asm</code> remain unchanged after that <code>asm</code>; it reloads them as
needed. 
Using the <code>"memory"</code> clobber effectively forms a read/write
memory barrier for the compiler.

     <p>Note that this clobber does not prevent the <em>processor</em> from doing
speculative reads past the <code>asm</code> statement. To prevent that, you need
processor-specific fence instructions.

 </dl>

 <p>Flushing registers to memory has performance implications and may be
an issue for time-sensitive code.  You can provide better information
to GCC to avoid this, as shown in the following examples.  At a
minimum, aliasing rules allow GCC to know what memory <em>doesn't</em>
need to be flushed.

 <p>Here is a fictitious sum of squares instruction, that takes two
pointers to floating point values in memory and produces a floating
point register output. 
Notice that <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code> both appear twice in the <code>asm</code>
parameters, once to specify memory accessed, and once to specify a
base register used by the <code>asm</code>.  You won't normally be wasting a
register by doing this as GCC can use the same register for both
purposes.  However, it would be foolish to use both <code>%1</code> and
<code>%3</code> for <code>x</code> in this <code>asm</code> and expect them to be the
same.  In fact, <code>%3</code> may well not be a register.  It might be a
symbolic memory reference to the object pointed to by <code>x</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm ("sumsq %0, %1, %2"
          : "+f" (result)
          : "r" (x), "r" (y), "m" (*x), "m" (*y));
</pre>
 <p>Here is a fictitious <code>*z++ = *x++ * *y++</code> instruction. 
Notice that the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> pointer registers
must be specified as input/output because the <code>asm</code> modifies
them.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm ("vecmul %0, %1, %2"
          : "+r" (z), "+r" (x), "+r" (y), "=m" (*z)
          : "m" (*x), "m" (*y));
</pre>
 <p>An x86 example where the string memory argument is of unknown length.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm("repne scasb"
         : "=c" (count), "+D" (p)
         : "m" (*(const char (*)[]) p), "0" (-1), "a" (0));
</pre>
 <p>If you know the above will only be reading a ten byte array then you
could instead use a memory input like:
<code>"m" (*(const char (*)[10]) p)</code>.

 <p>Here is an example of a PowerPC vector scale implemented in assembly,
complete with vector and condition code clobbers, and some initialized
offset registers that are unchanged by the <code>asm</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     void
     dscal (size_t n, double *x, double alpha)
     {
       asm ("/* lots of asm here */"
            : "+m" (*(double (*)[n]) x), "+&amp;r" (n), "+b" (x)
            : "d" (alpha), "b" (32), "b" (48), "b" (64),
              "b" (80), "b" (96), "b" (112)
            : "cr0",
              "vs32","vs33","vs34","vs35","vs36","vs37","vs38","vs39",
              "vs40","vs41","vs42","vs43","vs44","vs45","vs46","vs47");
     }
</pre>
 <p>Rather than allocating fixed registers via clobbers to provide scratch
registers for an <code>asm</code> statement, an alternative is to define a
variable and make it an early-clobber output as with <code>a2</code> and
<code>a3</code> in the example below.  This gives the compiler register
allocator more freedom.  You can also define a variable and make it an
output tied to an input as with <code>a0</code> and <code>a1</code>, tied
respectively to <code>ap</code> and <code>lda</code>.  Of course, with tied
outputs your <code>asm</code> can't use the input value after modifying the
output register since they are one and the same register.  What's
more, if you omit the early-clobber on the output, it is possible that
GCC might allocate the same register to another of the inputs if GCC
could prove they had the same value on entry to the <code>asm</code>.  This
is why <code>a1</code> has an early-clobber.  Its tied input, <code>lda</code>
might conceivably be known to have the value 16 and without an
early-clobber share the same register as <code>%11</code>.  On the other
hand, <code>ap</code> can't be the same as any of the other inputs, so an
early-clobber on <code>a0</code> is not needed.  It is also not desirable in
this case.  An early-clobber on <code>a0</code> would cause GCC to allocate
a separate register for the <code>"m" (*(const double (*)[]) ap)</code>
input.  Note that tying an input to an output is the way to set up an
initialized temporary register modified by an <code>asm</code> statement. 
An input not tied to an output is assumed by GCC to be unchanged, for
example <code>"b" (16)</code> below sets up <code>%11</code> to 16, and GCC might
use that register in following code if the value 16 happened to be
needed.  You can even use a normal <code>asm</code> output for a scratch if
all inputs that might share the same register are consumed before the
scratch is used.  The VSX registers clobbered by the <code>asm</code>
statement could have used this technique except for GCC's limit on the
number of <code>asm</code> parameters.

 <p><a name="GotoLabels"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.7 Goto Labels</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm_007d-goto-labels-3987"></a>
<code>asm goto</code> allows assembly code to jump to one or more C labels.  The
<var>GotoLabels</var> section in an <code>asm goto</code> statement contains
a comma-separated
list of all C labels to which the assembler code may jump. GCC assumes that
<code>asm</code> execution falls through to the next statement (if this is not the
case, consider using the <code>__builtin_unreachable</code> intrinsic after the
<code>asm</code> statement). Optimization of <code>asm goto</code> may be improved by
using the <code>hot</code> and <code>cold</code> label attributes (see <a href="#Label-Attributes">Label Attributes</a>).

 <p>An <code>asm goto</code> statement cannot have outputs. 
This is due to an internal restriction of
the compiler: control transfer instructions cannot have outputs. 
If the assembler code does modify anything, use the <code>"memory"</code> clobber
to force the
optimizers to flush all register values to memory and reload them if
necessary after the <code>asm</code> statement.

 <p>Also note that an <code>asm goto</code> statement is always implicitly
considered volatile.

 <p>To reference a label in the assembler template,
prefix it with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%l</span></samp>&rsquo; (lowercase &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;) followed
by its (zero-based) position in <var>GotoLabels</var> plus the number of input
operands.  For example, if the <code>asm</code> has three inputs and references two
labels, refer to the first label as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%l3</span></samp>&rsquo; and the second as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%l4</span></samp>&rsquo;).

 <p>Alternately, you can reference labels using the actual C label name enclosed
in brackets.  For example, to reference a label named <code>carry</code>, you can
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%l[carry]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The label must still be listed in the <var>GotoLabels</var>
section when using this approach.

 <p>Here is an example of <code>asm goto</code> for i386:

<pre class="example">     asm goto (
         "btl %1, %0\n\t"
         "jc %l2"
         : /* No outputs. */
         : "r" (p1), "r" (p2)
         : "cc"
         : carry);
     
     return 0;
     
     carry:
     return 1;
</pre>
 <p>The following example shows an <code>asm goto</code> that uses a memory clobber.

<pre class="example">     int frob(int x)
     {
       int y;
       asm goto ("frob %%r5, %1; jc %l[error]; mov (%2), %%r5"
                 : /* No outputs. */
                 : "r"(x), "r"(&amp;y)
                 : "r5", "memory"
                 : error);
       return y;
     error:
       return -1;
     }
</pre>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.8 x86 Operand Modifiers</h5>

<p>References to input, output, and goto operands in the assembler template
of extended <code>asm</code> statements can use
modifiers to affect the way the operands are formatted in
the code output to the assembler. For example, the
following code uses the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; modifiers for x86:

<pre class="example">     uint16_t  num;
     asm volatile ("xchg %h0, %b0" : "+a" (num) );
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">These modifiers generate this assembler code:

<pre class="example">     xchg %ah, %al
</pre>
 <p>The rest of this discussion uses the following code for illustrative purposes.

<pre class="example">     int main()
     {
        int iInt = 1;
     
     top:

        : /* No clobbers. */
        : top);
     }
</pre>
 <p>With no modifiers, this is what the output from the operands would be for the

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.2.9 x86 Floating-Point <code>asm</code> Operands</h5>

<p>On x86 targets, there are several rules on the usage of stack-like registers
in the operands of an <code>asm</code>.  These rules apply only to the operands
that are stack-like registers:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Given a set of input registers that die in an <code>asm</code>, it is
necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the <code>asm</code>, and
which must be explicitly popped by GCC.

     <p>An input register that is implicitly popped by the <code>asm</code> must be
explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an
output operand.

     <li>For any input register that is implicitly popped by an <code>asm</code>, it is
necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the pop. 
If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the reg-stack than
the implicitly popped register, it would not be possible to know what the
stack looked like&mdash;it's not clear how the rest of the stack &ldquo;slides
up&rdquo;.

     <p>All implicitly popped input registers must be closer to the top of
the reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.

     <p>It is possible that if an input dies in an <code>asm</code>, the compiler might
use the input register for an output reload.  Consider this example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This code says that input <code>b</code> is not popped by the <code>asm</code>, and that
the <code>asm</code> pushes a result onto the reg-stack, i.e., the stack is one
deeper after the <code>asm</code> than it was before.  But, it is possible that
reload may think that it can use the same register for both the input and
the output.

     <p>To prevent this from happening,
if any input operand uses the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint, all output register
constraints must use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; early-clobber modifier.

     <p>The example above is correctly written as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          asm ("foo" : "=&amp;t" (a) : "f" (b));
</pre>
     <li>Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
output operands fall in this category&mdash;GCC has no other way to
know which registers the outputs appear in unless you indicate
this in the constraints.

     <p>Output operands must specifically indicate which register an output
appears in after an <code>asm</code>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=f</span></samp>&rsquo; is not allowed: the operand
constraints must select a class with a single register.

     <li>Output operands may not be &ldquo;inserted&rdquo; between existing stack registers. 
Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all output operands
are dead before the <code>asm</code>, and are pushed by the <code>asm</code>. 
It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of the reg-stack.

     <p>Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
operands may not &ldquo;skip&rdquo; a register.

     <li>Some <code>asm</code> statements may need extra stack space for internal
calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
unrelated to the inputs and outputs.

      </ol>

 <p>This <code>asm</code>
takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This <code>asm</code> takes two inputs, which are popped by the <code>fyl2xp1</code> opcode,
and replaces them with one output.  The <code>st(1)</code> clobber is necessary
for the compiler to know that <code>fyl2xp1</code> pops both inputs.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");

Here are specific details on what constraint letters you can use with
<code>asm</code> operands. 
Constraints can say whether
an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the
operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it may
have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match. 
Side-effects aren't allowed in operands of inline <code>asm</code>, unless
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; constraints are used, because there is no guarantee
that the side effects will happen exactly once in an instruction that can update
the addressing register.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.3.1 Simple Constraints</h5>

<p><a name="index-simple-constraints-3991"></a>
The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:

     <dl>
<dt>whitespace<dd>Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any position
except the first.  This enables each alternative for different operands to
be visually aligned in the machine description even if they have different
number of constraints and modifiers.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bm_007d-in-constraint-3992"></a><a name="index-memory-references-in-constraints-3993"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
supports in general. 
Note that the letter used for the general memory constraint can be
re-defined by a back end using the <code>TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT</code> macro.

     <p><a name="index-offsettable-address-3994"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bo_007d-in-constraint-3995"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
<dfn>offsettable</dfn>.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
address.

     <p><a name="index-autoincrement_002fdecrement-addressing-3996"></a>For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
addressing modes that the machine supports.

     <p>Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
operand, the constraint letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; is valid only when accompanied
by both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bV_007d-in-constraint-3997"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">V</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything that
would fit the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint but not the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; constraint.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003c_007d-in-constraint-3998"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement or
postdecrement) is allowed.  In inline <code>asm</code> this constraint is only
allowed if the operand is used exactly once in an instruction that can
handle the side effects.  Not using an operand with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in constraint
string in the inline <code>asm</code> pattern at all or using it in multiple
instructions isn't valid, because the side effects wouldn't be performed
or would be performed more than once.  Furthermore, on some targets
the operand with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in constraint string must be accompanied by
special instruction suffixes like <code>%U0</code> instruction suffix on PowerPC
or <code>%P0</code> on IA-64.

This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at

Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;
rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;.

68000, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8. 
This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
instructions.

allowed.

     <p>This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
value.  So why use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;?  Sometimes it allows
better code to be generated.

     <p>For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between &minus;128
and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
done with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">moveq</span></samp>&rsquo; instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
by defining the letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo; to mean &ldquo;any integer outside the
range &minus;128 to 127&rdquo;, and then specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ks</span></samp>&rsquo; in the operand
constraints.

registers that are not general registers.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bX_007d-in-constraint-4012"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Any operand whatsoever is allowed.

If a
digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
digit should come last.

     <p>This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a single
decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since to-date
it has never been desirable that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>&rsquo; be interpreted as matching
either operand 1 <em>or</em> operand 0.  Should this be desired, one
can use multiple alternatives instead.

     <p><a name="index-matching-constraint-4015"></a><a name="index-constraint_002c-matching-4016"></a>This is called a <dfn>matching constraint</dfn> and what it really means is
that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
which <code>asm</code> distinguishes.  For example, an add instruction uses
two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC
machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
input-output operand:

     <pre class="smallexample">          addl #35,r12
</pre>
     <p>Matching constraints are used in these circumstances. 
More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
constraint.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.3.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints</h5>

<p><a name="index-multiple-alternative-constraints-4024"></a>
Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.

 <p>These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative. 
All operands for a single instruction must have the same number of
alternatives.

 <p>So the first alternative for the 68000's logical-or could be written as
<code>"+m" (output) : "ir" (input)</code>.  The second could be <code>"+r"
(output): "irm" (input)</code>.  However, the fact that two memory locations
cannot be used in a single instruction prevents simply using <code>"+rm"
(output) : "irm" (input)</code>.  Using multi-alternatives, this might be
written as <code>"+m,r" (output) : "ir,irm" (input)</code>.  This describes
all the available alternatives to the compiler, allowing it to choose
the most efficient one for the current conditions.

 <p>There is no way within the template to determine which alternative was
chosen.  However you may be able to wrap your <code>asm</code> statements with
builtins such as <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to achieve the desired results.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.3.3 Constraint Modifier Characters</h5>

<p><a name="index-modifiers-in-constraints-4025"></a><a name="index-constraint-modifier-characters-4026"></a>
<!-- prevent bad page break with this line -->
Here are constraint modifier characters.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003d_007d-in-constraint-4027"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Means that this operand is written to by this instruction:
the previous value is discarded and replaced by new data.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002b_007d-in-constraint-4028"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.

     <p>When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are read by the instruction and
which are written by it.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies an operand which is only
written; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies an operand that is both read and written; all
other operands are assumed to only be read.

     <p>If you specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; in a constraint, you put it in the
first character of the constraint string.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0026_007d-in-constraint-4029"></a><a name="index-earlyclobber-operand-4030"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
<dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operand, which is written before the instruction is
finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
in a register that is read by the instruction or as part of any memory
address.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; while others do not.  See, for example, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">movdf</span></samp>&rsquo; insn of the 68000.

     <p>A operand which is read by the instruction can be tied to an earlyclobber
operand if its only use as an input occurs before the early result is
written.  Adding alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce
better code when only some of the read operands can be affected by the
earlyclobber. See, for example, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mulsi3</span></samp>&rsquo; insn of the ARM.

     <p>Furthermore, if the <dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operand is also a read/write
operand, then that operand is written only after it's used.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; does not obviate the need to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;.  As
<dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operands are always written, a read-only
<dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operand is ill-formed and will be rejected by the
compiler.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0025_007d-in-constraint-4031"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
constraints.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; applies to all alternatives and must appear as
the first character in the constraint.  Only read-only operands can use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use more,
the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the modifier if
the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would only waste
time in the reload pass.

<p><a name="index-machine-specific-constraints-4032"></a><a name="index-constraints_002c-machine-specific-4033"></a>
Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in <code>asm</code> arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; see <a href="#Simple-Constraints">Simple Constraints</a>), and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>&rsquo;, usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.

 <p>Each architecture defines additional constraints.  These constraints
are used by the compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as
for <code>asm</code> statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not
particularly useful for <code>asm</code>.  Here is a summary of some of the
machine-dependent constraints available on some particular machines;
it includes both constraints that are useful for <code>asm</code> and
constraints that aren't.  The compiler source file mentioned in the
table heading for each architecture is the definitive reference for
the meanings of that architecture's constraints.

You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <code>asm</code> (or <code>__asm__</code>)
keyword after the declarator. 
It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols, or reference registers.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Assembler names for data:</h5>

<p>This sample shows how to specify the assembler name for data:

<pre class="smallexample">     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <code>foo</code> in
the assembler code should be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfoo</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than the usual
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.

 <p>On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.

 <p>GCC does not support using this feature with a non-static local variable
since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see
<a href="#Explicit-Register-Variables">Explicit Register Variables</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Assembler names for functions:</h5>

<p>To specify the assembler name for functions, write a declaration for the
function before its definition and put <code>asm</code> there, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     int func (int x, int y) asm ("MYFUNC");
     
     int func (int x, int y)
     {
        /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">This specifies that the name to be used for the function <code>func</code> in
the assembler code should be <code>MYFUNC</code>.

GNU C allows you to associate specific hardware registers with C
variables.  In almost all cases, allowing the compiler to assign
registers produces the best code.  However under certain unusual
circumstances, more precise control over the variable storage is
required.

 <p>Both global and local variables can be associated with a register.  The
consequences of performing this association are very different between
the two, as explained in the sections below.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Global-Register-Variables">Global Register Variables</a>:    Variables declared at global scope. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Local-Register-Variables">Local Register Variables</a>:     Variables declared within a function.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.5.1 Defining Global Register Variables</h5>

<p><a name="Global-Reg-Vars"></a><a name="index-global-register-variables-4040"></a><a name="index-registers_002c-global-variables-in-4041"></a><a name="index-registers_002c-global-allocation-4042"></a>
You can define a global register variable and associate it with a specified
register like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     register int *foo asm ("r12");
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here <code>r12</code> is the name of the register that should be used. Note that
this is the same syntax used for defining local register variables, but for
a global variable the declaration appears outside a function. The
<code>register</code> keyword is required, and cannot be combined with
<code>static</code>. The register name must be a valid register name for the
target platform.

 <p>Registers are a scarce resource on most systems and allowing the
compiler to manage their usage usually results in the best code. However,
under special circumstances it can make sense to reserve some globally. 
For example this may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters that have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.

 <p>After defining a global register variable, for the current compilation
unit:

     <ul>
<li>The register is reserved entirely for this use, and will not be
allocated for any other purpose. 
<li>The register is not saved and restored by any functions. 
<li>Stores into this register are never deleted even if they appear to be
dead, but references may be deleted, moved or simplified. 
</ul>

 <p>Note that these points <em>only</em> apply to code that is compiled with the
definition. The behavior of code that is merely linked in (for example
code from libraries) is not affected.

 <p>If you want to recompile source files that do not actually use your global
register variable so they do not use the specified register for any other
purpose, you need not actually add the global register declaration to
their source code. It suffices to specify the compiler option
<samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp> (see <a href="#Code-Gen-Options">Code Gen Options</a>) to reserve the
register.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Declaring the variable</h5>

<p>Global register variables can not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

 <p>When selecting a register, choose one that is normally saved and
restored by function calls on your machine. This ensures that code
which is unaware of this reservation (such as library routines) will
restore it before returning.

 <p>On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a global
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Using the variable</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bqsort_007d_002c-and-global-register-variables-4043"></a>When calling routines that are not aware of the reservation, be
cautious if those routines call back into code which uses them. As an
example, if you call the system library version of <code>qsort</code>, it may
clobber your registers during execution, but (if you have selected
appropriate registers) it will restore them before returning. However
it will <em>not</em> restore them before calling <code>qsort</code>'s comparison
function. As a result, global values will not reliably be available to
the comparison function unless the <code>qsort</code> function itself is rebuilt.

 <p>Similarly, it is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers or from more than one thread of control. Unless you recompile
them specially for the task at hand, the system library routines may
temporarily use the register for other things.

 <p><a name="index-register-variable-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4044"></a><a name="index-global-register-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4045"></a><a name="index-value-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4046"></a><a name="index-longjmp-4047"></a><a name="index-setjmp-4048"></a>On most machines, <code>longjmp</code> restores to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <code>setjmp</code>. On some
machines, however, <code>longjmp</code> does not change the value of global
register variables. To be portable, the function that called <code>setjmp</code>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <code>longjmp</code>. This way, the same
thing happens regardless of what <code>longjmp</code> does.

 <p>Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.

<p><a name="Local-Reg-Vars"></a><a name="index-local-variables_002c-specifying-registers-4049"></a><a name="index-specifying-registers-for-local-variables-4050"></a><a name="index-registers-for-local-variables-4051"></a>
You can define a local register variable and associate it with a specified
register like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     register int *foo asm ("r12");
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here <code>r12</code> is the name of the register that should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables,
but for a local variable the declaration appears within a function.  The
<code>register</code> keyword is required, and cannot be combined with
<code>static</code>.  The register name must be a valid register name for the
target platform.

 <p>As with global register variables, it is recommended that you choose
a register that is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that calls to library routines will not clobber it.

 <p>The only supported use for this feature is to specify registers
for input and output operands when calling Extended <code>asm</code>
(see <a href="#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>).  This may be necessary if the constraints for a
particular machine don't provide sufficient control to select the desired
register.  To force an operand into a register, create a local variable
and specify the register name after the variable's declaration.  Then use
the local variable for the <code>asm</code> operand and specify any constraint
letter that matches the register:

<pre class="smallexample">     register int *p1 asm ("r0") = ...;
     register int *p2 asm ("r1") = ...;
     register int *result asm ("r0");
     asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));
</pre>
 <p><em>Warning:</em> In the above example, be aware that a register (for example
<code>r0</code>) can be call-clobbered by subsequent code, including function
calls and library calls for arithmetic operators on other variables (for
example the initialization of <code>p2</code>).  In this case, use temporary
variables for expressions between the register assignments:

<pre class="smallexample">     int t1 = ...;
     register int *p1 asm ("r0") = ...;
     register int *p2 asm ("r1") = t1;
     register int *result asm ("r0");
     asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));
</pre>
 <p>Defining a register variable does not reserve the register.  Other than
when invoking the Extended <code>asm</code>, the contents of the specified
register are not guaranteed.  For this reason, the following uses
are explicitly <em>not</em> supported.  If they appear to work, it is only
happenstance, and may stop working as intended due to (seemingly)
unrelated changes in surrounding code, or even minor changes in the
optimization of a future version of gcc:

     <ul>
<li>Passing parameters to or from Basic <code>asm</code>
<li>Passing parameters to or from Extended <code>asm</code> without using input
or output operands. 
<li>Passing parameters to or from routines written in assembler (or
other languages) using non-standard calling conventions. 
</ul>

 <p>Some developers use Local Register Variables in an attempt to improve
gcc's allocation of registers, especially in large functions.  In this
case the register name is essentially a hint to the register allocator. 
While in some instances this can generate better code, improvements are
subject to the whims of the allocator/optimizers.  Since there are no
guarantees that your improvements won't be lost, this usage of Local
Register Variables is discouraged.

 <p>On the MIPS platform, there is related use for local register variables
with slightly different characteristics (see <a href="gccint.html#MIPS-Coprocessors">Defining coprocessor specifics for MIPS targets</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">6.45.6 Size of an <code>asm</code></h4>

<p>Some targets require that GCC track the size of each instruction used
in order to generate correct code.  Because the final length of the
code produced by an <code>asm</code> statement is only known by the
assembler, GCC must make an estimate as to how big it will be.  It
does this by counting the number of instructions in the pattern of the
<code>asm</code> and multiplying that by the length of the longest
instruction supported by that processor.  (When working out the number
of instructions, it assumes that any occurrence of a newline or of
whatever statement separator character is supported by the assembler &mdash;
typically &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; &mdash; indicates the end of an instruction.)

 <p>Normally, GCC's estimate is adequate to ensure that correct
code is generated, but it is possible to confuse the compiler if you use
pseudo instructions or assembler macros that expand into multiple real
instructions, or if you use assembler directives that expand to more
space in the object file than is needed for a single instruction. 
If this happens then the assembler may produce a diagnostic saying that
a label is unreachable.

 <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007basm-inline_007d-4052"></a>This size is also used for inlining decisions.  If you use <code>asm inline</code>
instead of just <code>asm</code>, then for inlining purposes the size of the asm
is taken as the minimum size, ignoring how many instructions GCC thinks it is.

<h3 class="section">6.46 Alternate Keywords</h3>

<p><a name="index-alternate-keywords-4053"></a><a name="index-keywords_002c-alternate-4054"></a>
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> and the various <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> options disable certain
keywords.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C extensions, or
a general-purpose header file that should be usable by all programs,
including ISO C programs.  The keywords <code>asm</code>, <code>typeof</code> and
<code>inline</code> are not available in programs compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> (although <code>inline</code> can be used in a
program compiled with <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-std=c11</span></samp>).  The
ISO C99 keyword
<code>restrict</code> is only available when <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp> (which will
eventually be the default) or <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> (or the equivalent
<samp><span class="option">-std=iso9899:1999</span></samp>), or an option for a later standard
version, is used.

 <p>The way to solve these problems is to put &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use <code>__asm__</code>
instead of <code>asm</code>, and <code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.

 <p>Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want to
compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords as
macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     #ifndef __GNUC__
     #define __asm__ asm
     #endif
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-g_t_005f_005fextension_005f_005f-4055"></a><a name="index-pedantic-4056"></a><samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> and other options cause warnings for many GNU C extensions. 
You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
<code>__extension__</code> before the expression.  <code>__extension__</code> has no
effect aside from this.

<h3 class="section">6.47 Incomplete <code>enum</code> Types</h3>

<p>You can define an <code>enum</code> tag without specifying its possible values. 
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
<code>struct foo</code> without describing the elements.  A later declaration
that does specify the possible values completes the type.

 <p>You cannot allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

 <p>This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
<code>enum</code> more consistent with the way <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code>
are handled.

 <p>This extension is not supported by GNU C++.

GCC provides three magic constants that hold the name of the current
function as a string.  In C++11 and later modes, all three are treated
as constant expressions and can be used in <code>constexpr</code> constexts. 
The first of these constants is <code>__func__</code>, which is part of
the C99 standard:

 <p>The identifier <code>__func__</code> is implicitly declared by the translator
as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
definition, the declaration

<pre class="smallexample">     static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.  As an
extension, at file (or, in C++, namespace scope), <code>__func__</code>
evaluates to the empty string.

 <p><code>__FUNCTION__</code> is another name for <code>__func__</code>, provided for
backward compatibility with old versions of GCC.

 <p>In C, <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> is yet another name for
<code>__func__</code>, except that at file (or, in C++, namespace scope),
it evaluates to the string <code>"top level"</code>.  In addition, in C++,
<code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> contains the signature of the function as
well as its bare name.  For example, this program:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern "C" int printf (const char *, ...);
     
     class a {
      public:
       void sub (int i)
         {
           printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
           printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
         }
     };
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       a ax;
       ax.sub (0);
       return 0;
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">gives this output:

<pre class="smallexample">     __FUNCTION__ = sub
     __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = void a::sub(int)
</pre>
 <p>These identifiers are variables, not preprocessor macros, and may not
be used to initialize <code>char</code> arrays or be concatenated with string
literals.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the return address of the current function, or of

the expected behavior is that the function returns the address of

<h3 class="section">6.50 Using Vector Instructions through Built-in Functions</h3>

<p>On some targets, the instruction set contains SIMD vector instructions which
operate on multiple values contained in one large register at the same time. 
For example, on the x86 the MMX, 3DNow! and SSE extensions can be used
this way.

 <p>The first step in using these extensions is to provide the necessary data
types.  This should be done using an appropriate <code>typedef</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">The <code>int</code> type specifies the base type, while the attribute specifies
the vector size for the variable, measured in bytes.  For example, the
declaration above causes the compiler to set the mode for the <code>v4si</code>
type to be 16 bytes wide and divided into <code>int</code> sized units.  For
a 32-bit <code>int</code> this means a vector of 4 units of 4 bytes, and the
corresponding mode of <code>foo</code> is <acronym>V4SI</acronym>.

 <p>The <code>vector_size</code> attribute is only applicable to integral and
float scalars, although arrays, pointers, and function return values
are allowed in conjunction with this construct. Only sizes that are
a power of two are currently allowed.

 <p>All the basic integer types can be used as base types, both as signed
and as unsigned: <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>,
<code>long long</code>.  In addition, <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> can be
used to build floating-point vector types.

 <p>Specifying a combination that is not valid for the current architecture
causes GCC to synthesize the instructions using a narrower mode. 
For example, if you specify a variable of type <code>V4SI</code> and your
architecture does not allow for this specific SIMD type, GCC
produces code that uses 4 <code>SIs</code>.

 <p>The types defined in this manner can be used with a subset of normal C
operations.  Currently, GCC allows using the following operators
on these types: <code>+, -, *, /, unary minus, ^, |, &amp;, ~, %</code>.

 <p>The operations behave like C++ <code>valarrays</code>.  Addition is defined as
the addition of the corresponding elements of the operands.  For
example, in the code below, each of the 4 elements in <var>a</var> is
added to the corresponding 4 elements in <var>b</var> and the resulting
vector is stored in <var>c</var>.

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
     
     v4si a, b, c;
     
     c = a + b;
</pre>
 <p>Subtraction, multiplication, division, and the logical operations
operate in a similar manner.  Likewise, the result of using the unary
minus or complement operators on a vector type is a vector whose
elements are the negative or complemented values of the corresponding
elements in the operand.

 <p>It is possible to use shifting operators <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> on
integer-type vectors. The operation is defined as following: <code>{a0,
a1, ..., an} &gt;&gt; {b0, b1, ..., bn} == {a0 &gt;&gt; b0, a1 &gt;&gt; b1,
..., an &gt;&gt; bn}</code>. Vector operands must have the same number of
elements.

 <p>For convenience, it is allowed to use a binary vector operation
where one operand is a scalar. In that case the compiler transforms
the scalar operand into a vector where each element is the scalar from
the operation. The transformation happens only if the scalar could be
safely converted to the vector-element type. 
Consider the following code.

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
     
     v4si a, b, c;
     long l;
     
     a = b + 1;    /* a = b + {1,1,1,1}; */
     a = 2 * b;    /* a = {2,2,2,2} * b; */
     
     a = l + a;    /* Error, cannot convert long to int. */
</pre>
 <p>Vectors can be subscripted as if the vector were an array with
the same number of elements and base type.  Out of bound accesses
invoke undefined behavior at run time.  Warnings for out of bound
accesses for vector subscription can be enabled with
<samp><span class="option">-Warray-bounds</span></samp>.

 <p>Vector comparison is supported with standard comparison
operators: <code>==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</code>. Comparison operands can be
vector expressions of integer-type or real-type. Comparison between
integer-type vectors and real-type vectors are not supported.  The
result of the comparison is a vector of the same width and number of
elements as the comparison operands with a signed integral element
type.

 <p>Vectors are compared element-wise producing 0 when comparison is false
and -1 (constant of the appropriate type where all bits are set)
otherwise. Consider the following example.

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
     
     v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
     v4si b = {3,2,1,4};
     v4si c;
     
     c = a &gt;  b;     /* The result would be {0, 0,-1, 0}  */
     c = a == b;     /* The result would be {0,-1, 0,-1}  */
</pre>
 <p>In C++, the ternary operator <code>?:</code> is available. <code>a?b:c</code>, where
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are vectors of the same type and <code>a</code> is an
integer vector with the same number of elements of the same size as <code>b</code>
and <code>c</code>, computes all three arguments and creates a vector
<code>{a[0]?b[0]:c[0], a[1]?b[1]:c[1], ...}</code>.  Note that unlike in
OpenCL, <code>a</code> is thus interpreted as <code>a != 0</code> and not <code>a &lt; 0</code>. 
As in the case of binary operations, this syntax is also accepted when
one of <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> is a scalar that is then transformed into a
vector. If both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are scalars and the type of
<code>true?b:c</code> has the same size as the element type of <code>a</code>, then
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are converted to a vector type whose elements have
this type and with the same number of elements as <code>a</code>.

 <p>In C++, the logic operators <code>!, &amp;&amp;, ||</code> are available for vectors. 
<code>!v</code> is equivalent to <code>v == 0</code>, <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> is equivalent to
<code>a!=0 &amp; b!=0</code> and <code>a || b</code> is equivalent to <code>a!=0 | b!=0</code>. 
For mixed operations between a scalar <code>s</code> and a vector <code>v</code>,
<code>s &amp;&amp; v</code> is equivalent to <code>s?v!=0:0</code> (the evaluation is
short-circuit) and <code>v &amp;&amp; s</code> is equivalent to <code>v!=0 &amp; (s?-1:0)</code>.

 <p><a name="index-g_t_005f_005fbuiltin_005fshuffle-4064"></a>Vector shuffling is available using functions
<code>__builtin_shuffle (vec, mask)</code> and
<code>__builtin_shuffle (vec0, vec1, mask)</code>. 
Both functions construct a permutation of elements from one or two
vectors and return a vector of the same type as the input vector(s). 
The <var>mask</var> is an integral vector with the same width (<var>W</var>)
and element count (<var>N</var>) as the output vector.

 <p>The elements of the input vectors are numbered in memory ordering of
<var>vec0</var> beginning at 0 and <var>vec1</var> beginning at <var>N</var>.  The
elements of <var>mask</var> are considered modulo <var>N</var> in the single-operand
case and modulo 2*<var>N</var> in the two-operand case.

 <p>Consider the following example,

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));
     
     v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
     v4si b = {5,6,7,8};
     v4si mask1 = {0,1,1,3};
     v4si mask2 = {0,4,2,5};
     v4si res;
     
     res = __builtin_shuffle (a, mask1);       /* res is {1,2,2,4}  */
     res = __builtin_shuffle (a, b, mask2);    /* res is {1,5,3,6}  */
</pre>
 <p>Note that <code>__builtin_shuffle</code> is intentionally semantically
compatible with the OpenCL <code>shuffle</code> and <code>shuffle2</code> functions.

 <p>You can declare variables and use them in function calls and returns, as
well as in assignments and some casts.  You can specify a vector type as
a return type for a function.  Vector types can also be used as function
arguments.  It is possible to cast from one vector type to another,
provided they are of the same size (in fact, you can also cast vectors
to and from other datatypes of the same size).

 <p>You cannot operate between vectors of different lengths or different
signedness without a cast.

<h3 class="section">6.52 Legacy <code>__sync</code> Built-in Functions for Atomic Memory Access</h3>

<p>The following built-in functions
are intended to be compatible with those described
in the <cite>Intel Itanium Processor-specific Application Binary Interface</cite>,
section 7.4.  As such, they depart from normal GCC practice by not using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__builtin_</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix and also by being overloaded so that they
work on multiple types.

 <p>The definition given in the Intel documentation allows only for the use of
the types <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>long long</code> or their unsigned
counterparts.  GCC allows any scalar type that is 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes in
size other than the C type <code>_Bool</code> or the C++ type <code>bool</code>. 
Operations on pointer arguments are performed as if the operands were
of the <code>uintptr_t</code> type.  That is, they are not scaled by the size
of the type to which the pointer points.

 <p>These functions are implemented in terms of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo;
builtins (see <a href="#g_t_005f_005fatomic-Builtins">__atomic Builtins</a>).  They should not be used for new
code which should use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; builtins instead.

 <p>Not all operations are supported by all target processors.  If a particular
operation cannot be implemented on the target processor, a warning is
generated and a call to an external function is generated.  The external
function carries the same name as the built-in version,
with an additional suffix
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo; where <var>n</var> is the size of the data type.

<!-- ??? Should we have a mechanism to suppress this warning?  This is almost -->
<!-- useful for implementing the operation under the control of an external -->
<!-- mutex. -->
 <p>In most cases, these built-in functions are considered a <dfn>full barrier</dfn>. 
That is,
no memory operand is moved across the operation, either forward or
backward.  Further, instructions are issued as necessary to prevent the
processor from speculating loads across the operation and from queuing stores
after the operation.

 <p>All of the routines are described in the Intel documentation to take
&ldquo;an optional list of variables protected by the memory barrier&rdquo;.  It's
not clear what is meant by that; it could mean that <em>only</em> the
listed variables are protected, or it could mean a list of additional
variables to be protected.  The list is ignored by GCC which treats it as
empty.  GCC interprets an empty list as meaning that all globally
accessible variables should be protected.

<h3 class="section">6.53 Built-in Functions for Memory Model Aware Atomic Operations</h3>

<p>The following built-in functions approximately match the requirements
for the C++11 memory model.  They are all
identified by being prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; and most are
overloaded so that they work with multiple types.

 <p>These functions are intended to replace the legacy &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__sync</span></samp>&rsquo;
builtins.  The main difference is that the memory order that is requested
is a parameter to the functions.  New code should always use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; builtins rather than the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__sync</span></samp>&rsquo; builtins.

 <p>Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; builtins assume that programs will
conform to the C++11 memory model.  In particular, they assume
that programs are free of data races.  See the C++11 standard for
detailed requirements.

 <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; builtins can be used with any integral scalar or
pointer type that is 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes in length.  16-byte integral
types are also allowed if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__int128</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="#g_t_005f_005fint128">__int128</a>) is
supported by the architecture.

 <p>The four non-arithmetic functions (load, store, exchange, and
compare_exchange) all have a generic version as well.  This generic
version works on any data type.  It uses the lock-free built-in function
if the specific data type size makes that possible; otherwise, an
external call is left to be resolved at run time.  This external call is
the same format with the addition of a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">size_t</span></samp>&rsquo; parameter inserted
as the first parameter indicating the size of the object being pointed to. 
All objects must be the same size.

 <p>There are 6 different memory orders that can be specified.  These map
to the C++11 memory orders with the same names, see the C++11 standard
or the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/AtomicSync">GCC wiki on atomic synchronization</a> for detailed definitions.  Individual
targets may also support additional memory orders for use on specific
architectures.  Refer to the target documentation for details of
these.

 <p>An atomic operation can both constrain code motion and
be mapped to hardware instructions for synchronization between threads
(e.g., a fence).  To which extent this happens is controlled by the
memory orders, which are listed here in approximately ascending order of
strength.  The description of each memory order is only meant to roughly
illustrate the effects and is not a specification; see the C++11
memory model for precise semantics.

     <dl>
<dt><code>__ATOMIC_RELAXED</code><dd>Implies no inter-thread ordering constraints. 
<br><dt><code>__ATOMIC_CONSUME</code><dd>This is currently implemented using the stronger <code>__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE</code>
memory order because of a deficiency in C++11's semantics for
<code>memory_order_consume</code>. 
<br><dt><code>__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE</code><dd>Creates an inter-thread happens-before constraint from the release (or
stronger) semantic store to this acquire load.  Can prevent hoisting
of code to before the operation. 
<br><dt><code>__ATOMIC_RELEASE</code><dd>Creates an inter-thread happens-before constraint to acquire (or stronger)
semantic loads that read from this release store.  Can prevent sinking
of code to after the operation. 
<br><dt><code>__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL</code><dd>Combines the effects of both <code>__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE</code> and
<code>__ATOMIC_RELEASE</code>. 
<br><dt><code>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</code><dd>Enforces total ordering with all other <code>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</code> operations. 
</dl>

 <p>Note that in the C++11 memory model, <em>fences</em> (e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__atomic_thread_fence</span></samp>&rsquo;) take effect in combination with other
atomic operations on specific memory locations (e.g., atomic loads);
operations on specific memory locations do not necessarily affect other
operations in the same way.

 <p>Target architectures are encouraged to provide their own patterns for
each of the atomic built-in functions.  If no target is provided, the original
non-memory model set of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__sync</span></samp>&rsquo; atomic built-in functions are
used, along with any required synchronization fences surrounding it in
order to achieve the proper behavior.  Execution in this case is subject
to the same restrictions as those built-in functions.

 <p>If there is no pattern or mechanism to provide a lock-free instruction
sequence, a call is made to an external routine with the same parameters
to be resolved at run time.

 <p>When implementing patterns for these built-in functions, the memory order
parameter can be ignored as long as the pattern implements the most
restrictive <code>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</code> memory order.  Any of the other memory
orders execute correctly with this memory order but they may not execute as
efficiently as they could with a more appropriate implementation of the
relaxed requirements.

 <p>Note that the C++11 standard allows for the memory order parameter to be
determined at run time rather than at compile time.  These built-in
functions map any run-time value to <code>__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST</code> rather
than invoke a runtime library call or inline a switch statement.  This is
standard compliant, safe, and the simplest approach for now.

 <p>The memory order parameter is a signed int, but only the lower 16 bits are
reserved for the memory order.  The remainder of the signed int is reserved
for target use and should be 0.  Use of the predefined atomic values
ensures proper usage.

GCC implements a limited buffer overflow protection mechanism that can
prevent some buffer overflow attacks by determining the sizes of objects
into which data is about to be written and preventing the writes when
the size isn't sufficient.  The built-in functions described below yield
the best results when used together and when optimization is enabled. 
For example, to detect object sizes across function boundaries or to
follow pointer assignments through non-trivial control flow they rely
on various optimization passes enabled with <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>.  However, to
a limited extent, they can be used without optimization as well.

 <p>There are built-in functions added for many common string operation
functions, e.g., for <code>memcpy</code> <code>__builtin___memcpy_chk</code>
built-in is provided.  This built-in has an additional last argument,
which is the number of bytes remaining in the object the <var>dest</var>
argument points to or <code>(size_t) -1</code> if the size is not known.

 <p>The built-in functions are optimized into the normal string functions
like <code>memcpy</code> if the last argument is <code>(size_t) -1</code> or if
it is known at compile time that the destination object will not
be overflowed.  If the compiler can determine at compile time that the
object will always be overflowed, it issues a warning.

 <p>Such built-in functions are provided for <code>memcpy</code>, <code>mempcpy</code>,
<code>memmove</code>, <code>memset</code>, <code>strcpy</code>, <code>stpcpy</code>, <code>strncpy</code>,
<code>strcat</code> and <code>strncat</code>.

 <p>There are also checking built-in functions for formatted output functions.
<pre class="smallexample">     int __builtin___sprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt, ...);
     int __builtin___snprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                                   const char *fmt, ...);
     int __builtin___vsprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt,
                                   va_list ap);
     int __builtin___vsnprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                                    const char *fmt, va_list ap);
</pre>
 <p>The added <var>flag</var> argument is passed unchanged to <code>__sprintf_chk</code>
etc. functions and can contain implementation specific flags on what
additional security measures the checking function might take, such as
handling <code>%n</code> differently.

 <p>The <var>os</var> argument is the object size <var>s</var> points to, like in the
other built-in functions.  There is a small difference in the behavior
though, if <var>os</var> is <code>(size_t) -1</code>, the built-in functions are
optimized into the non-checking functions only if <var>flag</var> is 0, otherwise
the checking function is called with <var>os</var> argument set to
<code>(size_t) -1</code>.

 <p>In addition to this, there are checking built-in functions
<code>__builtin___printf_chk</code>, <code>__builtin___vprintf_chk</code>,
<code>__builtin___fprintf_chk</code> and <code>__builtin___vfprintf_chk</code>. 
These have just one additional argument, <var>flag</var>, right before
format string <var>fmt</var>.  If the compiler is able to optimize them to
<code>fputc</code> etc. functions, it does, otherwise the checking function
is called and the <var>flag</var> argument passed to it.

GCC provides a set of built-in functions to control Pointer Bounds Checker
instrumentation.  Note that all Pointer Bounds Checker builtins can be used
even if you compile with Pointer Bounds Checker off
(<samp><span class="option">-fno-check-pointer-bounds</span></samp>). 
The behavior may differ in such case as documented below.

GCC provides a large number of built-in functions other than the ones
mentioned above.  Some of these are for internal use in the processing
of exceptions or variable-length argument lists and are not
documented here because they may change from time to time; we do not
recommend general use of these functions.

 <p>The remaining functions are provided for optimization purposes.

 <p>With the exception of built-ins that have library equivalents such as
the standard C library functions discussed below, or that expand to
library calls, GCC built-in functions are always expanded inline and
thus do not have corresponding entry points and their address cannot
be obtained.  Attempting to use them in an expression other than
a function call results in a compile-time error.

 <p><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-4576"></a>GCC includes built-in versions of many of the functions in the standard
C library.  These functions come in two forms: one whose names start with
the <code>__builtin_</code> prefix, and the other without.  Both forms have the
same type (including prototype), the same address (when their address is
taken), and the same meaning as the C library functions even if you specify
the <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp> option see <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">C Dialect Options</a>).  Many of these
functions are only optimized in certain cases; if they are not optimized in
a particular case, a call to the library function is emitted.

 <p>GCC provides built-in versions of the ISO C99 floating-point comparison
macros that avoid raising exceptions for unordered operands.  They have
the same names as the standard macros ( <code>isgreater</code>,
<code>isgreaterequal</code>, <code>isless</code>, <code>islessequal</code>,
<code>islessgreater</code>, and <code>isunordered</code>) , with <code>__builtin_</code>
prefixed.  We intend for a library implementor to be able to simply
<code>#define</code> each standard macro to its built-in equivalent. 
In the same fashion, GCC provides <code>fpclassify</code>, <code>isfinite</code>,
<code>isinf_sign</code>, <code>isnormal</code> and <code>signbit</code> built-ins used with
<code>__builtin_</code> prefixed.  The <code>isinf</code> and <code>isnan</code>
built-in functions appear both with and without the <code>__builtin_</code> prefix.

The function allocates an object <var>size</var> bytes large on the stack
of the calling function.  The object is aligned on the default stack
alignment boundary for the target determined by the
<code>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</code> macro.  The <code>__builtin_alloca</code>
function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated object. 
The lifetime of the allocated object ends just before the calling
function returns to its caller.   This is so even when
<code>__builtin_alloca</code> is called within a nested block.

      <p>For example, the following function allocates eight objects of <code>n</code>
bytes each on the stack, storing a pointer to each in consecutive elements
of the array <code>a</code>.  It then passes the array to function <code>g</code>
which can safely use the storage pointed to by each of the array elements.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f (unsigned n)
          {
            void *a [8];

      <p>Since the <code>__builtin_alloca</code> function doesn't validate its argument
it is the responsibility of its caller to make sure the argument doesn't
cause it to exceed the stack size limit. 
The <code>__builtin_alloca</code> function is provided to make it possible to
allocate on the stack arrays of bytes with an upper bound that may be
computed at run time.  Since C99 Variable Length Arrays offer
similar functionality under a portable, more convenient, and safer
interface they are recommended instead, in both C99 and C++ programs
where GCC provides them as an extension.

<blockquote><p>The <code>__builtin_alloca_with_align</code> function must be called at block

the boundary specified by the argument <var>alignment</var> whose unit is given
in bits (not bytes).  The <var>size</var> argument must be positive and not
exceed the stack size limit.  The <var>alignment</var> argument must be a constant
integer expression that evaluates to a power of 2 greater than or equal to
<code>CHAR_BIT</code> and less than some unspecified maximum.  Invocations
with other values are rejected with an error indicating the valid bounds. 
The function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated object. 
The lifetime of the allocated object ends at the end of the block in which

just before the calling function returns to its caller, but may be released
at the end of the block in which the function was called.

      <p>For example, in the following function the call to <code>g</code> is unsafe
because when <code>overalign</code> is non-zero, the space allocated by

<blockquote>
      <p>You can use the built-in function <code>__builtin_types_compatible_p</code> to
determine whether two types are the same.

      <p>This built-in function returns 1 if the unqualified versions of the
types <var>type1</var> and <var>type2</var> (which are types, not expressions) are
compatible, 0 otherwise.  The result of this built-in function can be
used in integer constant expressions.

      <p>This built-in function ignores top level qualifiers (e.g., <code>const</code>,
<code>volatile</code>).  For example, <code>int</code> is equivalent to <code>const
int</code>.

      <p>The type <code>int[]</code> and <code>int[5]</code> are compatible.  On the other
hand, <code>int</code> and <code>char *</code> are not compatible, even if the size
of their types, on the particular architecture are the same.  Also, the
amount of pointer indirection is taken into account when determining
similarity.  Consequently, <code>short *</code> is not similar to
<code>short **</code>.  Furthermore, two types that are typedefed are
considered compatible if their underlying types are compatible.

      <p>An <code>enum</code> type is not considered to be compatible with another
<code>enum</code> type even if both are compatible with the same integer
type; this is what the C standard specifies. 
For example, <code>enum {foo, bar}</code> is not similar to
<code>enum {hot, dog}</code>.

<blockquote>
      <p>The built-in function <code>__builtin_tgmath</code>, available only for C
and Objective-C, calls a function determined according to the rules of
<code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code> macros.  It is intended to be used in
implementations of that header, so that expansions of macros from that
header only expand each of their arguments once, to avoid problems
when calls to such macros are nested inside the arguments of other
calls to such macros; in addition, it results in better diagnostics
for invalid calls to <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code> macros than implementations
using other GNU C language features.  For example, the <code>pow</code>
type-generic macro might be defined as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define pow(a, b) __builtin_tgmath (powf, pow, powl, \
                                              cpowf, cpow, cpowl, a, b)
</pre>
      <p>The arguments to <code>__builtin_tgmath</code> are at least two pointers to
functions, followed by the arguments to the type-generic macro (which
will be passed as arguments to the selected function).  All the
pointers to functions must be pointers to prototyped functions, none
of which may have variable arguments, and all of which must have the
same number of parameters; the number of parameters of the first
function determines how many arguments to <code>__builtin_tgmath</code> are
interpreted as function pointers, and how many as the arguments to the
called function.

      <p>The types of the specified functions must all be different, but
related to each other in the same way as a set of functions that may
be selected between by a macro in <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code>.  This means that
the functions are parameterized by a floating-point type <var>t</var>,
different for each such function.  The function return types may all
be the same type, or they may be <var>t</var> for each function, or they
may be the real type corresponding to <var>t</var> for each function (if
some of the types <var>t</var> are complex).  Likewise, for each parameter
position, the type of the parameter in that position may always be the
same type, or may be <var>t</var> for each function (this case must apply
for at least one parameter position), or may be the real type
corresponding to <var>t</var> for each function.

      <p>The standard rules for <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code> macros are used to find a
common type <var>u</var> from the types of the arguments for parameters
whose types vary between the functions; complex integer types (a GNU
extension) are treated like <code>_Complex double</code> for this purpose
(or <code>_Complex _Float64</code> if all the function return types are the
same <code>_Float</code><var>n</var> or <code>_Float</code><var>n</var><code>x</code> type). 
If the function return types vary, or are all the same integer type,
the function called is the one for which <var>t</var> is <var>u</var>, and it is
an error if there is no such function.  If the function return types
are all the same floating-point type, the type-generic macro is taken
to be one of those from TS 18661 that rounds the result to a narrower
type; if there is a function for which <var>t</var> is <var>u</var>, it is
called, and otherwise the first function, if any, for which <var>t</var>
has at least the range and precision of <var>u</var> is called, and it is
an error if there is no such function.

<blockquote><p>You can use the built-in function <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to
determine if a value is known to be constant at compile time and hence
that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that
value.  The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
return of 0 does not indicate that the value is <em>not</em> a constant,
but merely that GCC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
value of the <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option.

      <p>You typically use this function in an embedded application where
memory is a critical resource.  If you have some complex calculation,
you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but need to call
a function if it does not.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define Scale_Value(X)      \
            (__builtin_constant_p (X) \
            ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))
</pre>
      <p>You may use this built-in function in either a macro or an inline
function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
argument of the function as the argument to the built-in, GCC
never returns 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
or compound literal (see <a href="#Compound-Literals">Compound Literals</a>) and does not return 1
when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
specify the <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option.

      <p>You may also use <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> in initializers for static
data.  For instance, you can write

     <pre class="smallexample">          static const int table[] = {
             __builtin_constant_p (EXPRESSION) ? (EXPRESSION) : -1,
             /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
          };
</pre>
      <p class="noindent">This is an acceptable initializer even if <var>EXPRESSION</var> is not a
constant expression, including the case where
<code>__builtin_constant_p</code> returns 1 because <var>EXPRESSION</var> can be
folded to a constant but <var>EXPRESSION</var> contains operands that are
not otherwise permitted in a static initializer (for example,
<code>0 &amp;&amp; foo ()</code>).  GCC must be more conservative about evaluating the
built-in in this case, because it has no opportunity to perform
optimization.

the program is undefined.  It is useful in situations where the
compiler cannot deduce the unreachability of the code.

      <p>One such case is immediately following an <code>asm</code> statement that
either never terminates, or one that transfers control elsewhere
and never returns.  In this example, without the
<code>__builtin_unreachable</code>, GCC issues a warning that control
reaches the end of a non-void function.  It also generates code
to return after the <code>asm</code>.

if it has three, the third argument should have integer type, and
if it is nonzero means misalignment offset.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *x = __builtin_assume_aligned (arg, 16);
</pre>
      <p class="noindent">means that the compiler can assume <code>x</code>, set to <code>arg</code>, is at least
16-byte aligned, while:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *x = __builtin_assume_aligned (arg, 32, 8);
</pre>
      <p class="noindent">means that the compiler can assume for <code>x</code>, set to <code>arg</code>, that
<code>(char *) x - 8</code> is 32-byte aligned.

<blockquote><p>This function is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data into
a cache before it is accessed. 
You can insert calls to <code>__builtin_prefetch</code> into code for which
you know addresses of data in memory that is likely to be accessed soon. 
If the target supports them, data prefetch instructions are generated. 
If the prefetch is done early enough before the access then the data will
be in the cache by the time it is accessed.

      <p>The value of <var>addr</var> is the address of the memory to prefetch. 
There are two optional arguments, <var>rw</var> and <var>locality</var>. 
The value of <var>rw</var> is a compile-time constant one or zero; one
means that the prefetch is preparing for a write to the memory address
and zero, the default, means that the prefetch is preparing for a read. 
The value <var>locality</var> must be a compile-time constant integer between
zero and three.  A value of zero means that the data has no temporal
locality, so it need not be left in the cache after the access.  A value
of three means that the data has a high degree of temporal locality and
should be left in all levels of cache possible.  Values of one and two
mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree of temporal locality.  The
default is three.

     <pre class="smallexample">          for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)

      <p>Data prefetch does not generate faults if <var>addr</var> is invalid, but
the address expression itself must be valid.  For example, a prefetch
of <code>p-&gt;next</code> does not fault if <code>p-&gt;next</code> is not a valid
address, but evaluation faults if <code>p</code> is not a valid address.

      <p>If the target does not support data prefetch, the address expression
is evaluated if it includes side effects but no other code is generated
and GCC does not issue a warning.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.4 ARC Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>The following built-in functions are provided for ARC targets.  The
built-ins generate the corresponding assembly instructions.  In the
examples given below, the generated code often requires an operand or
result to be in a register.  Where necessary further code will be
generated to ensure this is true, but for brevity this is not
described in each case.

 <p><em>Note:</em> Using a built-in to generate an instruction not supported
by a target may cause problems. At present the compiler is not
guaranteed to detect such misuse, and as a result an internal compiler
error may be generated.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.5 ARC SIMD Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>SIMD builtins provided by the compiler can be used to generate the
vector instructions.  This section describes the available builtins
and their usage in programs.  With the <samp><span class="option">-msimd</span></samp> option, the
compiler provides 128-bit vector types, which can be specified using
the <code>vector_size</code> attribute.  The header file <samp><span class="file">arc-simd.h</span></samp>
can be included to use the following predefined types:
<pre class="example">     typedef int __v4si   __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
     typedef short __v8hi __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
</pre>
 <p>These types can be used to define 128-bit variables.  The built-in
functions listed in the following section can be used on these
variables to generate the vector operations.

 <p>For all builtins, <code>__builtin_arc_</code><var>someinsn</var>, the header file
<samp><span class="file">arc-simd.h</span></samp> also provides equivalent macros called
<code>_</code><var>someinsn</var> that can be used for programming ease and
improved readability.  The following macros for DMA control are also
provided:
<pre class="example">     #define _setup_dma_in_channel_reg _vdiwr
     #define _setup_dma_out_channel_reg _vdowr
</pre>
 <p>The following is a complete list of all the SIMD built-ins provided

<p>GCC implements extensions for C as described in the ARM C Language
Extensions (ACLE) specification, which can be found at
<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0053c/IHI0053C_acle_2_0.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0053c/IHI0053C_acle_2_0.pdf</a>.

 <p>As a part of ACLE, GCC implements extensions for Advanced SIMD as described in
the ARM C Language Extensions Specification.  The complete list of Advanced SIMD
intrinsics can be found at
<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0073a/IHI0073A_arm_neon_intrinsics_ref.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0073a/IHI0073A_arm_neon_intrinsics_ref.pdf</a>. 
The built-in intrinsics for the Advanced SIMD extension are available when
NEON is enabled.

 <p>Currently, ARM and AArch64 back ends do not support ACLE 2.0 fully.  Both
back ends support CRC32 intrinsics and the ARM back end supports the
Coprocessor intrinsics, all from <samp><span class="file">arm_acle.h</span></samp>.  The ARM back end's 16-bit
floating-point Advanced SIMD intrinsics currently comply to ACLE v1.1. 
AArch64's back end does not have support for 16-bit floating point Advanced SIMD
intrinsics yet.

 <p>See <a href="#ARM-Options">ARM Options</a> and <a href="#AArch64-Options">AArch64 Options</a> for more information on the
availability of extensions.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.10 AVR Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>For each built-in function for AVR, there is an equally named,
uppercase built-in macro defined. That way users can easily query if
or if not a specific built-in is implemented or not. For example, if
<code>__builtin_avr_nop</code> is available the macro
<code>__BUILTIN_AVR_NOP</code> is defined to <code>1</code> and undefined otherwise.

     <dl>
<dt><code>void __builtin_avr_nop (void)</code><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_sei (void)</code><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_cli (void)</code><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_sleep (void)</code><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_wdr (void)</code><dt><code>unsigned char __builtin_avr_swap (unsigned char)</code><dt><code>unsigned int __builtin_avr_fmul (unsigned char, unsigned char)</code><dt><code>int __builtin_avr_fmuls (char, char)</code><dt><code>int __builtin_avr_fmulsu (char, unsigned char)</code><dd>These built-in functions map to the respective machine
instruction, i.e. <code>nop</code>, <code>sei</code>, <code>cli</code>, <code>sleep</code>,
<code>wdr</code>, <code>swap</code>, <code>fmul</code>, <code>fmuls</code>
resp. <code>fmulsu</code>. The three <code>fmul*</code> built-ins are implemented
as library call if no hardware multiplier is available.

     <br><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_delay_cycles (unsigned long ticks)</code><dd>Delay execution for <var>ticks</var> cycles. Note that this
built-in does not take into account the effect of interrupts that
might increase delay time. <var>ticks</var> must be a compile-time
integer constant; delays with a variable number of cycles are not supported.

     <br><dt><code>char __builtin_avr_flash_segment (const __memx void*)</code><dd>This built-in takes a byte address to the 24-bit
<a href="#AVR-Named-Address-Spaces">address space</a> <code>__memx</code> and returns
the number of the flash segment (the 64 KiB chunk) where the address
points to.  Counting starts at <code>0</code>. 
If the address does not point to flash memory, return <code>-1</code>.

     <br><dt><code>uint8_t __builtin_avr_insert_bits (uint32_t map, uint8_t bits, uint8_t val)</code><dd>Insert bits from <var>bits</var> into <var>val</var> and return the resulting
value. The nibbles of <var>map</var> determine how the insertion is
performed: Let <var>X</var> be the <var>n</var>-th nibble of <var>map</var>
          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If <var>X</var> is <code>0xf</code>,
then the <var>n</var>-th bit of <var>val</var> is returned unaltered.

          <li>If X is in the range 0<small class="dots">...</small>7,
then the <var>n</var>-th result bit is set to the <var>X</var>-th bit of <var>bits</var>

          <li>If X is in the range 8<small class="dots">...</small><code>0xe</code>,
then the <var>n</var>-th result bit is undefined.
          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">One typical use case for this built-in is adjusting input and
output values to non-contiguous port layouts. Some examples:

     <pre class="smallexample">          // same as val, bits is unused
          __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0xffffffff, bits, val)
</pre>
     <pre class="smallexample">          // same as bits, val is unused
          __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x76543210, bits, val)
</pre>
     <pre class="smallexample">          // same as rotating bits by 4
          __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x32107654, bits, 0)
</pre>
     <pre class="smallexample">          // high nibble of result is the high nibble of val
          // low nibble of result is the low nibble of bits
          __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0xffff3210, bits, val)
</pre>
     <pre class="smallexample">          // reverse the bit order of bits
          __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x01234567, bits, 0)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>void __builtin_avr_nops (unsigned count)</code><dd>Insert <var>count</var> <code>NOP</code> instructions. 
The number of instructions must be a compile-time integer constant.

 </dl>

<p class="noindent">There are many more AVR-specific built-in functions that are used to
implement the ISO/IEC TR 18037 &ldquo;Embedded C&rdquo; fixed-point functions of
section 7.18a.6.  You don't need to use these built-ins directly. 
Instead, use the declarations as supplied by the <code>stdfix.h</code> header
with GNU-C99:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;stdfix.h&gt;
     
     // Re-interpret the bit representation of unsigned 16-bit
     // integer <var>uval</var> as Q-format 0.16 value.
     unsigned fract get_bits (uint_ur_t uval)
     {
         return urbits (uval);

<p>Currently, there are two Blackfin-specific built-in functions.  These are
used for generating <code>CSYNC</code> and <code>SSYNC</code> machine insns without
using inline assembly; by using these built-in functions the compiler can
automatically add workarounds for hardware errata involving these
instructions.  These functions are named as follows:

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.12 FR-V Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides many FR-V-specific built-in functions.  In general,
these functions are intended to be compatible with those described
by <cite>FR-V Family, Softune C/C++ Compiler Manual (V6), Fujitsu
Semiconductor</cite>.  The two exceptions are <code>__MDUNPACKH</code> and
<code>__MBTOHE</code>, the GCC forms of which pass 128-bit values by
pointer rather than by value.

 <p>Most of the functions are named after specific FR-V instructions. 
Such functions are said to be &ldquo;directly mapped&rdquo; and are summarized
here in tabular form.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.59.12.1 Argument Types</h5>

<p>The arguments to the built-in functions can be divided into three groups:
register numbers, compile-time constants and run-time values.  In order
to make this classification clear at a glance, the arguments and return
values are given the following pseudo types:

 <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">Pseudo type </td><td valign="top" width="30%">Real C type </td><td valign="top" width="15%">Constant? </td><td valign="top" width="35%">Description

<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%"><code>uw2</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>unsigned long long</code> </td><td valign="top" width="15%">No
</td><td valign="top" width="35%">an unsigned doubleword
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%"><code>sw2</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>long long</code> </td><td valign="top" width="15%">No </td><td valign="top" width="35%">a signed doubleword
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%"><code>const</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>int</code> </td><td valign="top" width="15%">Yes </td><td valign="top" width="35%">an integer constant
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%"><code>acc</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>int</code> </td><td valign="top" width="15%">Yes </td><td valign="top" width="35%">an ACC register number
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%"><code>iacc</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>int</code> </td><td valign="top" width="15%">Yes </td><td valign="top" width="35%">an IACC register number
 <br></td></tr></table>

 <p>These pseudo types are not defined by GCC, they are simply a notational
convenience used in this manual.

 <p>Arguments of type <code>uh</code>, <code>uw1</code>, <code>sw1</code>, <code>uw2</code>
and <code>sw2</code> are evaluated at run time.  They correspond to
register operands in the underlying FR-V instructions.

 <p><code>const</code> arguments represent immediate operands in the underlying
FR-V instructions.  They must be compile-time constants.

 <p><code>acc</code> arguments are evaluated at compile time and specify the number
of an accumulator register.  For example, an <code>acc</code> argument of 2
selects the ACC2 register.

 <p><code>iacc</code> arguments are similar to <code>acc</code> arguments but specify the
number of an IACC register.  See see <a href="#Other-Built_002din-Functions">Other Built-in Functions</a>
for more details.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.13 MIPS DSP Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>The MIPS DSP Application-Specific Extension (ASE) includes new
instructions that are designed to improve the performance of DSP and
media applications.  It provides instructions that operate on packed
8-bit/16-bit integer data, Q7, Q15 and Q31 fractional data.

 <p>GCC supports MIPS DSP operations using both the generic
vector extensions (see <a href="#Vector-Extensions">Vector Extensions</a>) and a collection of
MIPS-specific built-in functions.  Both kinds of support are
enabled by the <samp><span class="option">-mdsp</span></samp> command-line option.

 <p>Revision 2 of the ASE was introduced in the second half of 2006. 
This revision adds extra instructions to the original ASE, but is
otherwise backwards-compatible with it.  You can select revision 2
using the command-line option <samp><span class="option">-mdspr2</span></samp>; this option implies
<samp><span class="option">-mdsp</span></samp>.

 <p>The SCOUNT and POS bits of the DSP control register are global.  The
WRDSP, EXTPDP, EXTPDPV and MTHLIP instructions modify the SCOUNT and
POS bits.  During optimization, the compiler does not delete these
instructions and it does not delete calls to functions containing
these instructions.

 <p>At present, GCC only provides support for operations on 32-bit
vectors.  The vector type associated with 8-bit integer data is
usually called <code>v4i8</code>, the vector type associated with Q7
is usually called <code>v4q7</code>, the vector type associated with 16-bit
integer data is usually called <code>v2i16</code>, and the vector type
associated with Q15 is usually called <code>v2q15</code>.  They can be
defined in C as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef signed char v4i8 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef signed char v4q7 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef short v2i16 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef short v2q15 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
</pre>
 <p><code>v4i8</code>, <code>v4q7</code>, <code>v2i16</code> and <code>v2q15</code> values are
initialized in the same way as aggregates.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     v4i8 a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
     v4i8 b;
     b = (v4i8) {5, 6, 7, 8};
     
     v2q15 c = {0x0fcb, 0x3a75};
     v2q15 d;
     d = (v2q15) {0.1234 * 0x1.0p15, 0.4567 * 0x1.0p15};
</pre>
 <p><em>Note:</em> The CPU's endianness determines the order in which values
are packed.  On little-endian targets, the first value is the least
significant and the last value is the most significant.  The opposite
order applies to big-endian targets.  For example, the code above
sets the lowest byte of <code>a</code> to <code>1</code> on little-endian targets
and <code>4</code> on big-endian targets.

 <p><em>Note:</em> Q7, Q15 and Q31 values must be initialized with their integer
representation.  As shown in this example, the integer representation
of a Q7 value can be obtained by multiplying the fractional value by
<code>0x1.0p7</code>.  The equivalent for Q15 values is to multiply by
<code>0x1.0p15</code>.  The equivalent for Q31 values is to multiply by
<code>0x1.0p31</code>.

 <p>The table below lists the <code>v4i8</code> and <code>v2q15</code> operations for which
hardware support exists.  <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <code>v4i8</code> values,
and <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> are <code>v2q15</code> values.

 <p>It is easier to describe the DSP built-in functions if we first define
the following types:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef int q31;
     typedef int i32;
     typedef unsigned int ui32;
     typedef long long a64;
</pre>
 <p><code>q31</code> and <code>i32</code> are actually the same as <code>int</code>, but we
use <code>q31</code> to indicate a Q31 fractional value and <code>i32</code> to
indicate a 32-bit integer value.  Similarly, <code>a64</code> is the same as
<code>long long</code>, but we use <code>a64</code> to indicate values that are
placed in one of the four DSP accumulators (<code>$ac0</code>,
<code>$ac1</code>, <code>$ac2</code> or <code>$ac3</code>).

 <p>Also, some built-in functions prefer or require immediate numbers as
parameters, because the corresponding DSP instructions accept both immediate
numbers and register operands, or accept immediate numbers only.  The
immediate parameters are listed as follows.

<pre class="smallexample">     imm0_3: 0 to 3.
     imm0_7: 0 to 7.
     imm0_15: 0 to 15.
     imm0_31: 0 to 31.
     imm0_63: 0 to 63.
     imm0_255: 0 to 255.
     imm_n32_31: -32 to 31.
     imm_n512_511: -512 to 511.
</pre>
 <p>The following built-in functions map directly to a particular MIPS DSP
instruction.  Please refer to the architecture specification
for details on what each instruction does.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.14 MIPS Paired-Single Support</h4>

<p>The MIPS64 architecture includes a number of instructions that
operate on pairs of single-precision floating-point values. 
Each pair is packed into a 64-bit floating-point register,
with one element being designated the &ldquo;upper half&rdquo; and
the other being designated the &ldquo;lower half&rdquo;.

 <p>GCC supports paired-single operations using both the generic
vector extensions (see <a href="#Vector-Extensions">Vector Extensions</a>) and a collection of
MIPS-specific built-in functions.  Both kinds of support are
enabled by the <samp><span class="option">-mpaired-single</span></samp> command-line option.

 <p>The vector type associated with paired-single values is usually
called <code>v2sf</code>.  It can be defined in C as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef float v2sf __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));
</pre>
 <p><code>v2sf</code> values are initialized in the same way as aggregates. 
For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     v2sf a = {1.5, 9.1};
     v2sf b;
     float e, f;
     b = (v2sf) {e, f};
</pre>
 <p><em>Note:</em> The CPU's endianness determines which value is stored in
the upper half of a register and which value is stored in the lower half. 
On little-endian targets, the first value is the lower one and the second
value is the upper one.  The opposite order applies to big-endian targets. 
For example, the code above sets the lower half of <code>a</code> to
<code>1.5</code> on little-endian targets and <code>9.1</code> on big-endian targets.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.15 MIPS Loongson Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides intrinsics to access the SIMD instructions provided by the
ST Microelectronics Loongson-2E and -2F processors.  These intrinsics,
available after inclusion of the <code>loongson.h</code> header file,
operate on the following 64-bit vector types:

     <ul>
<li><code>uint8x8_t</code>, a vector of eight unsigned 8-bit integers;
<li><code>uint16x4_t</code>, a vector of four unsigned 16-bit integers;
<li><code>uint32x2_t</code>, a vector of two unsigned 32-bit integers;
<li><code>int8x8_t</code>, a vector of eight signed 8-bit integers;
<li><code>int16x4_t</code>, a vector of four signed 16-bit integers;
<li><code>int32x2_t</code>, a vector of two signed 32-bit integers. 
</ul>

 <p>The intrinsics provided are listed below; each is named after the
machine instruction to which it corresponds, with suffixes added as
appropriate to distinguish intrinsics that expand to the same machine
instruction yet have different argument types.  Refer to the architecture
documentation for a description of the functionality of each
instruction.

</ul>

<p>GCC provides intrinsics to access the SIMD instructions provided by the
MSA MIPS SIMD Architecture.  The interface is made available by including
<code>&lt;msa.h&gt;</code> and using <samp><span class="option">-mmsa -mhard-float -mfp64 -mnan=2008</span></samp>. 
For each <code>__builtin_msa_*</code>, there is a shortened name of the intrinsic,
<code>__msa_*</code>.

 <p>MSA implements 128-bit wide vector registers, operating on 8-, 16-, 32- and
64-bit integer, 16- and 32-bit fixed-point, or 32- and 64-bit floating point
data elements.  The following vectors typedefs are included in <code>msa.h</code>:
     <ul>
<li><code>v16i8</code>, a vector of sixteen signed 8-bit integers;
<li><code>v16u8</code>, a vector of sixteen unsigned 8-bit integers;
<li><code>v8i16</code>, a vector of eight signed 16-bit integers;
<li><code>v8u16</code>, a vector of eight unsigned 16-bit integers;
<li><code>v4i32</code>, a vector of four signed 32-bit integers;
<li><code>v4u32</code>, a vector of four unsigned 32-bit integers;
<li><code>v2i64</code>, a vector of two signed 64-bit integers;
<li><code>v2u64</code>, a vector of two unsigned 64-bit integers;
<li><code>v4f32</code>, a vector of four 32-bit floats;
<li><code>v2f64</code>, a vector of two 64-bit doubles. 
</ul>

 <p>Instructions and corresponding built-ins may have additional restrictions and/or
input/output values manipulated:
     <ul>

<dt><code>__bic_SR_register_on_exit (int </code><var>mask</var><code>)</code><dd>This clears the indicated bits in the saved copy of the status register

cycles (between 0 and about 17E9) to complete.  The inserted sequence
may use jumps, loops, or no-ops, and does not interfere with any other
instructions.  Note that <var>cycles</var> must be a compile-time constant
integer - that is, you must pass a number, not a variable that may be
optimized to a constant later.  The number of cycles delayed by this
builtin is exact.

<blockquote><p>This function returns a value of <code>1</code> if the run-time CPU supports the HWCAP
feature <var>feature</var> and returns <code>0</code> otherwise.

      <p>The <code>__builtin_cpu_supports</code> function requires GLIBC 2.23 or
newer which exports the hardware capability bits.  GCC defines the
macro <code>__BUILTIN_CPU_SUPPORTS__</code> if the
<code>__builtin_cpu_supports</code> built-in function is fully supported.

      <p>If GCC was configured to use a GLIBC before 2.23, the built-in
function <code>__builtin_cpu_suports</code> always returns a 0 and the
compiler issues a warning.

      <p>The following features can be
detected:

      <p>Here is an example:

</pre>
 <p>The <code>vec_rsqrt</code>, <code>__builtin_rsqrt</code>, and
<code>__builtin_rsqrtf</code> functions generate multiple instructions to
implement the reciprocal sqrt functionality using reciprocal sqrt
estimate instructions.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_recipdiv</code>, and <code>__builtin_recipdivf</code>
functions generate multiple instructions to implement division using
the reciprocal estimate instructions.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_ppc_get_timebase</code> and <code>__builtin_ppc_mftb</code>
functions generate instructions to read the Time Base Register.  The
<code>__builtin_ppc_get_timebase</code> function may generate multiple
instructions and always returns the 64 bits of the Time Base Register. 
The <code>__builtin_ppc_mftb</code> function always generates one instruction and
returns the Time Base Register value as an unsigned long, throwing away
the most significant word on 32-bit environments.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_unpack_longdouble</code> function takes a
<code>long double</code> argument and a compile time constant of 0 or 1.  If
the constant is 0, the first <code>double</code> within the
<code>long double</code> is returned, otherwise the second <code>double</code>
is returned.  The <code>__builtin_unpack_longdouble</code> function is only
availble if <code>long double</code> uses the IBM extended double
representation.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_pack_longdouble</code> function takes two <code>double</code>
arguments and returns a <code>long double</code> value that combines the two
arguments.  The <code>__builtin_pack_longdouble</code> function is only
availble if <code>long double</code> uses the IBM extended double
representation.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_unpack_ibm128</code> function takes a <code>__ibm128</code>
argument and a compile time constant of 0 or 1.  If the constant is 0,
the first <code>double</code> within the <code>__ibm128</code> is returned,
otherwise the second <code>double</code> is returned.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_pack_ibm128</code> function takes two <code>double</code>
arguments and returns a <code>__ibm128</code> value that combines the two
arguments.

 <p>Additional built-in functions are available for the 64-bit PowerPC
family of processors, for efficient use of 128-bit floating point
(<code>__float128</code>) values.

 <p>Previous versions of GCC supported some 'q' builtins for IEEE 128-bit
floating point.  These functions are now mapped into the equivalent
'f128' builtin functions.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_darn</code> and <code>__builtin_darn_raw</code>
functions require a
64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. 
The <code>__builtin_darn</code> function provides a 64-bit conditioned
random number.  The <code>__builtin_darn_raw</code> function provides a
64-bit raw random number.  The <code>__builtin_darn_32</code> function
provides a 32-bit random number.

 <p>The <code>scalar_extract_exp</code> and <code>scalar_extract_sig</code>
functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. 
The <code>scalar_extract_exp</code> and <code>scalar_extract_sig</code> built-in
functions return the significand and the biased exponent value
respectively of their <code>source</code> arguments. 
When supplied with a 64-bit <code>source</code> argument, the
result returned by <code>scalar_extract_sig</code> has
the <code>0x0010000000000000</code> bit set if the
function's <code>source</code> argument is in normalized form. 
Otherwise, this bit is set to 0. 
When supplied with a 128-bit <code>source</code> argument, the
<code>0x00010000000000000000000000000000</code> bit of the result is
treated similarly. 
Note that the sign of the significand is not represented in the result
returned from the <code>scalar_extract_sig</code> function.  Use the
<code>scalar_test_neg</code> function to test the sign of its <code>double</code>
argument.

 <p>The <code>scalar_insert_exp</code>
functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later. 
When supplied with a 64-bit first argument, the
<code>scalar_insert_exp</code> built-in function returns a double-precision
floating point value that is constructed by assembling the values of its
<code>significand</code> and <code>exponent</code> arguments.  The sign of the
result is copied from the most significant bit of the
<code>significand</code> argument.  The significand and exponent components
of the result are composed of the least significant 11 bits of the
<code>exponent</code> argument and the least significant 52 bits of the
<code>significand</code> argument respectively.

 <p>When supplied with a 128-bit first argument, the
<code>scalar_insert_exp</code> built-in function returns a quad-precision
ieee floating point value.  The sign bit of the result is copied from
the most significant bit of the <code>significand</code> argument. 
The significand and exponent components of the result are composed of
the least significant 15 bits of the <code>exponent</code> argument and the
least significant 112 bits of the <code>significand</code> argument respectively.

 <p>The <code>scalar_cmp_exp_gt</code>, <code>scalar_cmp_exp_lt</code>,
<code>scalar_cmp_exp_eq</code>, and <code>scalar_cmp_exp_unordered</code> built-in
functions return a non-zero value if <code>arg1</code> is greater than, less
than, equal to, or not comparable to <code>arg2</code> respectively.  The
arguments are not comparable if one or the other equals NaN (not a
number).

 <p>The <code>scalar_test_data_class</code> built-in function returns 1
if any of the condition tests enabled by the value of the
<code>condition</code> variable are true, and 0 otherwise.  The
<code>condition</code> argument must be a compile-time constant integer with
value not exceeding 127.  The
<code>condition</code> argument is encoded as a bitmask with each bit
enabling the testing of a different condition, as characterized by the
following:
<pre class="smallexample">     0x40    Test for NaN
     0x20    Test for +Infinity
     0x10    Test for -Infinity
     0x08    Test for +Zero
     0x04    Test for -Zero
     0x02    Test for +Denormal
     0x01    Test for -Denormal
</pre>
 <p>The <code>scalar_test_neg</code> built-in function returns 1 if its
<code>source</code> argument holds a negative value, 0 otherwise.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_byte_in_set</code> function requires a
64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later.  This function returns
a non-zero value if and only if its <code>u</code> argument exactly equals one of
the eight bytes contained within its 64-bit <code>set</code> argument.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_byte_in_range</code> and
<code>__builtin_byte_in_either_range</code> require an environment
supporting ISA 3.0 or later.  For these two functions, the
<code>range</code> argument is encoded as 4 bytes, organized as
<code>hi_1:lo_1:hi_2:lo_2</code>. 
The <code>__builtin_byte_in_range</code> function returns a
non-zero value if and only if its <code>u</code> argument is within the
range bounded between <code>lo_2</code> and <code>hi_2</code> inclusive. 
The <code>__builtin_byte_in_either_range</code> function returns non-zero if
and only if its <code>u</code> argument is within either the range bounded
between <code>lo_1</code> and <code>hi_1</code> inclusive or the range bounded
between <code>lo_2</code> and <code>hi_2</code> inclusive.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_lt</code> function returns a non-zero value
if and only if the number of signficant digits of its <code>value</code> argument
is less than its <code>comparison</code> argument.  The
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_lt_dd</code> and
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_lt_td</code> functions behave similarly, but
require that the type of the <code>value</code> argument be
<code>__Decimal64</code> and <code>__Decimal128</code> respectively.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_gt</code> function returns a non-zero value
if and only if the number of signficant digits of its <code>value</code> argument
is greater than its <code>comparison</code> argument.  The
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_gt_dd</code> and
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_gt_td</code> functions behave similarly, but
require that the type of the <code>value</code> argument be
<code>__Decimal64</code> and <code>__Decimal128</code> respectively.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_eq</code> function returns a non-zero value
if and only if the number of signficant digits of its <code>value</code> argument
equals its <code>comparison</code> argument.  The
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_eq_dd</code> and
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_eq_td</code> functions behave similarly, but
require that the type of the <code>value</code> argument be
<code>__Decimal64</code> and <code>__Decimal128</code> respectively.

 <p>The <code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_ov</code> function returns a non-zero value
if and only if its <code>value</code> argument has an undefined number of
significant digits, such as when <code>value</code> is an encoding of <code>NaN</code>. 
The <code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_ov_dd</code> and
<code>__builtin_dfp_dtstsfi_ov_td</code> functions behave similarly, but
require that the type of the <code>value</code> argument be
<code>__Decimal64</code> and <code>__Decimal128</code> respectively.

 <p>The <code>vec_all_nez</code>, <code>vec_any_eqz</code>, and <code>vec_cmpnez</code>
perform pairwise comparisons between the elements at the same
positions within their two vector arguments. 
The <code>vec_all_nez</code> function returns a
non-zero value if and only if all pairwise comparisons are not
equal and no element of either vector argument contains a zero. 
The <code>vec_any_eqz</code> function returns a
non-zero value if and only if at least one pairwise comparison is equal
or if at least one element of either vector argument contains a zero. 
The <code>vec_cmpnez</code> function returns a vector of the same type as
its two arguments, within which each element consists of all ones to
denote that either the corresponding elements of the incoming arguments are
not equal or that at least one of the corresponding elements contains
zero.  Otherwise, the element of the returned vector contains all zeros.

 <p>The <code>vec_cntlz_lsbb</code> function returns the count of the number of
consecutive leading byte elements (starting from position 0 within the
supplied vector argument) for which the least-significant bit
equals zero.  The <code>vec_cnttz_lsbb</code> function returns the count of
the number of consecutive trailing byte elements (starting from
position 15 and counting backwards within the supplied vector
argument) for which the least-significant bit equals zero.

 <p>The <code>vec_xl_len</code> and <code>vec_xst_len</code> functions require a
64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later.  The <code>vec_xl_len</code>
function loads a variable length vector from memory.  The
<code>vec_xst_len</code> function stores a variable length vector to memory. 
With both the <code>vec_xl_len</code> and <code>vec_xst_len</code> functions, the
<code>addr</code> argument represents the memory address to or from which
data will be transferred, and the
<code>len</code> argument represents the number of bytes to be
transferred, as computed by the C expression <code>min((len &amp; 0xff), 16)</code>. 
If this expression's value is not a multiple of the vector element's
size, the behavior of this function is undefined. 
In the case that the underlying computer is configured to run in
big-endian mode, the data transfer moves bytes 0 to <code>(len - 1)</code> of
the corresponding vector.  In little-endian mode, the data transfer
moves bytes <code>(16 - len)</code> to <code>15</code> of the corresponding
vector.  For the load function, any bytes of the result vector that
are not loaded from memory are set to zero. 
The value of the <code>addr</code> argument need not be aligned on a
multiple of the vector's element size.

 <p>The <code>vec_xlx</code> and <code>vec_xrx</code> functions extract the single
element selected by the <code>index</code> argument from the vector
represented by the <code>data</code> argument.  The <code>index</code> argument
always specifies a byte offset, regardless of the size of the vector
element.  With <code>vec_xlx</code>, <code>index</code> is the offset of the first
byte of the element to be extracted.  With <code>vec_xrx</code>, <code>index</code>
represents the last byte of the element to be extracted, measured
from the right end of the vector.  In other words, the last byte of
the element to be extracted is found at position <code>(15 - index)</code>. 
There is no requirement that <code>index</code> be a multiple of the vector
element size.  However, if the size of the vector element added to
<code>index</code> is greater than 15, the content of the returned value is
undefined.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.22 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
<code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> and using <samp><span class="option">-maltivec</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mabi=altivec</span></samp>.  The interface supports the following vector
types.

<pre class="smallexample">     vector unsigned char
     vector signed char
     vector bool char
     
     vector unsigned short
     vector signed short
     vector bool short
     vector pixel
     
     vector unsigned int
     vector signed int
     vector bool int
     vector float
</pre>
 <p>If <samp><span class="option">-mvsx</span></samp> is used the following additional vector types are
implemented.

<pre class="smallexample">     vector unsigned long
     vector signed long
     vector double
</pre>
 <p>The long types are only implemented for 64-bit code generation, and
the long type is only used in the floating point/integer conversion
instructions.

 <p>GCC's implementation of the high-level language interface available from
C and C++ code differs from Motorola's documentation in several ways.

     <ul>
<li>A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly braces.

     <li>A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of the
same type as the variable it is initializing.

     <li>If <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> is omitted, the signedness of the
vector type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program should
always specify the signedness.

     <li>Compiling with <samp><span class="option">-maltivec</span></samp> adds keywords <code>__vector</code>,
<code>vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>, <code>pixel</code>, <code>__bool</code> and
<code>bool</code>.  When compiling ISO C, the context-sensitive substitution
of the keywords <code>vector</code>, <code>pixel</code> and <code>bool</code> is
disabled.  To use them, you must include <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> instead.

     <li>GCC allows using a <code>typedef</code> name as the type specifier for a
vector type, but only under the following circumstances:

          <ul>
<li>When using <code>__vector</code> instead of <code>vector</code>; for example,

          <pre class="smallexample">               typedef signed short int16;
               __vector int16 data;
</pre>
          <li>When using <code>vector</code> in keyword-and-predefine mode; for example,

          <pre class="smallexample">               typedef signed short int16;
               vector int16 data;
</pre>
          <p>Note that keyword-and-predefine mode is enabled by disabling GNU
extensions (e.g., by using <code>-std=c11</code>) and including
<code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code>. 
</ul>

     <li>For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the following
does not work:

     <pre class="smallexample">            vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Since <code>vec_add</code> is a macro, the vector constant in the example
is treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
parentheses for this to work. 
</ul>

 <p><em>Note:</em> Only the <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> interface is supported. 
Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in
the aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are
subject to change without notice.

 <p>GCC complies with the OpenPOWER 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification,
which may be found at
<a href="http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi-prd/content/index.html">http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi-prd/content/index.html</a>. 
Appendix A of this document lists the vector API interfaces that must be
provided by compliant compilers.  Programmers should preferentially use
the interfaces described therein.  However, historically GCC has provided
additional interfaces for access to vector instructions.  These are
briefly described below.

 <p>The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there
is a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.

 <p>Arguments that are documented as <code>const int</code> require literal
integral values within the range required for that operation.

</pre>
 <p>The <code>vec_extract_sig</code> and <code>vec_extract_exp</code> built-in
functions return vectors representing the significands and biased
exponent values of their <code>source</code> arguments respectively. 
Within the result vector returned by <code>vec_extract_sig</code>, the
<code>0x800000</code> bit of each vector element returned when the
function's <code>source</code> argument is of type <code>float</code> is set to 1
if the corresponding floating point value is in normalized form. 
Otherwise, this bit is set to 0.  When the <code>source</code> argument is
of type <code>double</code>, the <code>0x10000000000000</code> bit within each of
the result vector's elements is set according to the same rules. 
Note that the sign of the significand is not represented in the result
returned from the <code>vec_extract_sig</code> function.  To extract the
sign bits, use the
<code>vec_cpsgn</code> function, which returns a new vector within which all
of the sign bits of its second argument vector are overwritten with the
sign bits copied from the coresponding elements of its first argument
vector, and all other (non-sign) bits of the second argument vector
are copied unchanged into the result vector.

 <p>The <code>vec_insert_exp</code> built-in functions return a vector of
single- or double-precision floating
point values constructed by assembling the values of their
<code>significands</code> and <code>exponents</code> arguments into the
corresponding elements of the returned vector. 
The sign of each
element of the result is copied from the most significant bit of the
corresponding entry within the <code>significands</code> argument. 
Note that the relevant
bits of the <code>significands</code> argument are the same, for both integer
and floating point types. 
The
significand and exponent components of each element of the result are
composed of the least significant bits of the corresponding
<code>significands</code> element and the least significant bits of the
corresponding <code>exponents</code> element.

 <p>The <code>vec_test_data_class</code> built-in function returns a vector
representing the results of testing the <code>source</code> vector for the
condition selected by the <code>condition</code> argument.  The
<code>condition</code> argument must be a compile-time constant integer with
value not exceeding 127.  The
<code>condition</code> argument is encoded as a bitmask with each bit
enabling the testing of a different condition, as characterized by the
following:
<pre class="smallexample">     0x40    Test for NaN
     0x20    Test for +Infinity
     0x10    Test for -Infinity
     0x08    Test for +Zero
     0x04    Test for -Zero
     0x02    Test for +Denormal
     0x01    Test for -Denormal
</pre>
 <p>If any of the enabled test conditions is true, the corresponding entry
in the result vector is -1.  Otherwise (all of the enabled test
conditions are false), the corresponding entry of the result vector is 0.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.23 PowerPC Hardware Transactional Memory Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides two interfaces for accessing the Hardware Transactional
Memory (HTM) instructions available on some of the PowerPC family
of processors (eg, POWER8).  The two interfaces come in a low level
interface, consisting of built-in functions specific to PowerPC and a
higher level interface consisting of inline functions that are common
between PowerPC and S/390.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.59.23.1 PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions</h5>

<p>The following low level built-in functions are available with
<samp><span class="option">-mhtm</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=CPU</span></samp> where CPU is `power8' or later. 
They all generate the machine instruction that is part of the name.

 <p>The HTM builtins (with the exception of <code>__builtin_tbegin</code>) return
the full 4-bit condition register value set by their associated hardware
instruction.  The header file <code>htmintrin.h</code> defines some macros that can
be used to decipher the return value.  The <code>__builtin_tbegin</code> builtin
returns a simple true or false value depending on whether a transaction was
successfully started or not.  The arguments of the builtins match exactly the
type and order of the associated hardware instruction's operands, except for
the <code>__builtin_tcheck</code> builtin, which does not take any input arguments. 
Refer to the ISA manual for a description of each instruction's operands.

<pre class="smallexample">     unsigned int __builtin_tbegin (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tend (unsigned int)
     
     unsigned int __builtin_tabort (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)
     
     unsigned int __builtin_tcheck (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_treclaim (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_trechkpt (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsr (unsigned int)
</pre>
 <p>In addition to the above HTM built-ins, we have added built-ins for
some common extended mnemonics of the HTM instructions:

<pre class="smallexample">     unsigned int __builtin_tendall (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tresume (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsuspend (void)
</pre>
 <p>Note that the semantics of the above HTM builtins are required to mimic
the locking semantics used for critical sections.  Builtins that are used
to create a new transaction or restart a suspended transaction must have
lock acquisition like semantics while those builtins that end or suspend a
transaction must have lock release like semantics.  Specifically, this must
mimic lock semantics as specified by C++11, for example: Lock acquisition is
as-if an execution of __atomic_exchange_n(&amp;globallock,1,__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)
that returns 0, and lock release is as-if an execution of
__atomic_store(&amp;globallock,0,__ATOMIC_RELEASE), with globallock being an
implicit implementation-defined lock used for all transactions.  The HTM
instructions associated with with the builtins inherently provide the
correct acquisition and release hardware barriers required.  However,
the compiler must also be prohibited from moving loads and stores across
the builtins in a way that would violate their semantics.  This has been
accomplished by adding memory barriers to the associated HTM instructions
(which is a conservative approach to provide acquire and release semantics). 
Earlier versions of the compiler did not treat the HTM instructions as
memory barriers.  A <code>__TM_FENCE__</code> macro has been added, which can
be used to determine whether the current compiler treats HTM instructions
as memory barriers or not.  This allows the user to explicitly add memory
barriers to their code when using an older version of the compiler.

 <p>The following set of built-in functions are available to gain access
to the HTM specific special purpose registers.

<pre class="smallexample">     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasr (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasru (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfhar (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfiar (void)
     
     void __builtin_set_texasr (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_texasru (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfhar (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfiar (unsigned long);
</pre>
 <p>Example usage of these low level built-in functions may look like:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;htmintrin.h&gt;
     
     int num_retries = 10;
     
     while (1)
       {
         if (__builtin_tbegin (0))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __builtin_tabort (0);
             ... transaction code...
             __builtin_tend (0);
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- &lt;= 0
                 || _TEXASRU_FAILURE_PERSISTENT (__builtin_get_texasru ()))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }
</pre>
 <p>One final built-in function has been added that returns the value of
the 2-bit Transaction State field of the Machine Status Register (MSR)
as stored in <code>CR0</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     unsigned long __builtin_ttest (void)
</pre>
 <p>This built-in can be used to determine the current transaction state
using the following code example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;htmintrin.h&gt;
     
     unsigned char tx_state = _HTM_STATE (__builtin_ttest ());
     
     if (tx_state == _HTM_TRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_NONTRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in non-transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_SUSPENDED)
       {
         /* Code to use in transaction suspended state.  */
       }
</pre>
 <h5 class="subsubsection">6.59.23.2 PowerPC HTM High Level Inline Functions</h5>

<p>The following high level HTM interface is made available by including
<code>&lt;htmxlintrin.h&gt;</code> and using <samp><span class="option">-mhtm</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mcpu=CPU</span></samp>
where CPU is `power8' or later.  This interface is common between PowerPC
and S/390, allowing users to write one HTM source implementation that
can be compiled and executed on either system.

<pre class="smallexample">     long __TM_simple_begin (void)
     long __TM_begin (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_end (void)
     void __TM_abort (void)
     void __TM_named_abort (unsigned char const code)
     void __TM_resume (void)
     void __TM_suspend (void)
     
     long __TM_is_user_abort (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_named_user_abort (void* const TM_buff, unsigned char *code)
     long __TM_is_illegal (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_footprint_exceeded (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_nesting_depth (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_nested_too_deep(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_conflict(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_failure_persistent(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_failure_address(void* const TM_buff)
     long long __TM_failure_code(void* const TM_buff)
</pre>
 <p>Using these common set of HTM inline functions, we can create
a more portable version of the HTM example in the previous
section that will work on either PowerPC or S/390:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;htmxlintrin.h&gt;
     
     int num_retries = 10;
     TM_buff_type TM_buff;
     
     while (1)
       {
         if (__TM_begin (TM_buff) == _HTM_TBEGIN_STARTED)
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __TM_abort ();
             ... transaction code...
             __TM_end ();
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- &lt;= 0
                 || __TM_is_failure_persistent (TM_buff))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

<blockquote><p>Generates the <code>tbegin</code> machine instruction starting a
non-constrained hardware transaction.  If the parameter is non-NULL the
memory area is used to store the transaction diagnostic buffer and
will be passed as first operand to <code>tbegin</code>.  This buffer can be
defined using the <code>struct __htm_tdb</code> C struct defined in
<code>htmintrin.h</code> and must reside on a double-word boundary.  The
second tbegin operand is set to <code>0xff0c</code>. This enables
save/restore of all GPRs and disables aborts for FPR and AR
manipulations inside the transaction body.  The condition code set by
the tbegin instruction is returned as integer value.  The tbegin
instruction by definition overwrites the content of all FPRs.  The
compiler will generate code which saves and restores the FPRs.  For
soft-float code it is recommended to used the <code>*_nofloat</code>
variant.  In order to prevent a TDB from being written it is required
to pass a constant zero value as parameter.  Passing a zero value
through a variable is not sufficient.  Although modifications of
access registers inside the transaction will not trigger an
transaction abort it is not supported to actually modify them.  Access
registers do not get saved when entering a transaction. They will have
undefined state when reaching the abort code.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.29 SPU Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides extensions for the SPU processor as described in the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification.  GCC's
implementation differs in several ways.

     <ul>
<li>The optional extension of specifying vector constants in parentheses is
not supported.

     <li>A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of the
same type as the variable it is initializing.

     <li>If <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> is omitted, the signedness of the
vector type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program should
always specify the signedness.

     <li>By default, the keyword <code>__vector</code> is added. The macro
<code>vector</code> is defined in <code>&lt;spu_intrinsics.h&gt;</code> and can be
undefined.

     <li>GCC allows using a <code>typedef</code> name as the type specifier for a
vector type.

     <li>For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the following
does not work:

     <pre class="smallexample">            spu_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Since <code>spu_add</code> is a macro, the vector constant in the example
is treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
parentheses for this to work.

     <li>The extended version of <code>__builtin_expect</code> is not supported.

 </ul>

 <p><em>Note:</em> Only the interface described in the aforementioned
specification is supported. Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to
implement the required functionality, but these are not supported and
are subject to change without notice.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.33 x86 Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>These built-in functions are available for the x86-32 and x86-64 family
of computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

 <p>If you specify command-line switches such as <samp><span class="option">-msse</span></samp>,
the compiler could use the extended instruction sets even if the built-ins
are not used explicitly in the program.  For this reason, applications
that perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular,
the file containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without
these options.

 <p>The following machine modes are available for use with MMX built-in functions
(see <a href="#Vector-Extensions">Vector Extensions</a>): <code>V2SI</code> for a vector of two 32-bit integers,
<code>V4HI</code> for a vector of four 16-bit integers, and <code>V8QI</code> for a
vector of eight 8-bit integers.  Some of the built-in functions operate on
MMX registers as a whole 64-bit entity, these use <code>V1DI</code> as their mode.

 <p>If 3DNow! extensions are enabled, <code>V2SF</code> is used as a mode for a vector
of two 32-bit floating-point values.

 <p>If SSE extensions are enabled, <code>V4SF</code> is used for a vector of four 32-bit
floating-point values.  Some instructions use a vector of four 32-bit
integers, these use <code>V4SI</code>.  Finally, some instructions operate on an
entire vector register, interpreting it as a 128-bit integer, these use mode
<code>TI</code>.

 <p>The x86-32 and x86-64 family of processors use additional built-in
functions for efficient use of <code>TF</code> (<code>__float128</code>) 128-bit
floating point and <code>TC</code> 128-bit complex floating-point values.

 <p>The following floating-point built-in functions are always available.  All
of them implement the function that is part of the name.

<h4 class="subsection">6.59.34 x86 Transactional Memory Intrinsics</h4>

<p>These hardware transactional memory intrinsics for x86 allow you to use
memory transactions with RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory). 
This support is enabled with the <samp><span class="option">-mrtm</span></samp> option. 
For using HLE (Hardware Lock Elision) see
<a href="#x86-specific-memory-model-extensions-for-transactional-memory">x86 specific memory model extensions for transactional memory</a> instead.

 <p>A memory transaction commits all changes to memory in an atomic way,
as visible to other threads. If the transaction fails it is rolled back
and all side effects discarded.

 <p>Generally there is no guarantee that a memory transaction ever succeeds
and suitable fallback code always needs to be supplied.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; RTM Function: unsigned <b>_xbegin</b> ()<var><a name="index-g_t_005fxbegin-4735"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Start a RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) transaction. 
Returns <code>_XBEGIN_STARTED</code> when the transaction
started successfully (note this is not 0, so the constant has to be
explicitly tested).

      <p>If the transaction aborts, all side effects
are undone and an abort code encoded as a bit mask is returned. 
The following macros are defined:

          <dl>
<dt><code>_XABORT_EXPLICIT</code><dd>Transaction was explicitly aborted with <code>_xabort</code>.  The parameter passed
to <code>_xabort</code> is available with <code>_XABORT_CODE(status)</code>. 
<br><dt><code>_XABORT_RETRY</code><dd>Transaction retry is possible. 
<br><dt><code>_XABORT_CONFLICT</code><dd>Transaction abort due to a memory conflict with another thread. 
<br><dt><code>_XABORT_CAPACITY</code><dd>Transaction abort due to the transaction using too much memory. 
<br><dt><code>_XABORT_DEBUG</code><dd>Transaction abort due to a debug trap. 
<br><dt><code>_XABORT_NESTED</code><dd>Transaction abort in an inner nested transaction. 
</dl>

      <p>There is no guarantee
any transaction ever succeeds, so there always needs to be a valid
fallback path. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; RTM Function: void <b>_xend</b> ()<var><a name="index-g_t_005fxend-4736"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Commit the current transaction. When no transaction is active this faults. 
All memory side effects of the transaction become visible
to other threads in an atomic manner. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; RTM Function: int <b>_xtest</b> ()<var><a name="index-g_t_005fxtest-4737"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return a nonzero value if a transaction is currently active, otherwise 0. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; RTM Function: void <b>_xabort</b> (<var>status</var>)<var><a name="index-g_t_005fxabort-4738"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Abort the current transaction. When no transaction is active this is a no-op. 
The <var>status</var> is an 8-bit constant; its value is encoded in the return
value from <code>_xbegin</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p>Here is an example showing handling for <code>_XABORT_RETRY</code>
and a fallback path for other failures:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;immintrin.h&gt;
     
     int n_tries, max_tries;
     unsigned status = _XABORT_EXPLICIT;
     ...
     
     for (n_tries = 0; n_tries &lt; max_tries; n_tries++)
       {
         status = _xbegin ();
         if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED || !(status &amp; _XABORT_RETRY))
           break;
       }
     if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED)
       {
         ... transaction code...
         _xend ();
       }
     else
       {
         ... non-transactional fallback path...
       }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Note that, in most cases, the transactional and non-transactional code
must synchronize together to ensure consistency.

and is not carried out by this version of the compiler.

 <p>Additionally, <code>CFStringRefs</code> (defined by the <code>CoreFoundation</code> headers) may
also be used as format arguments.  Note that the relevant headers are only likely to be
available on Darwin (OSX) installations.  On such installations, the XCode and system
documentation provide descriptions of <code>CFString</code>, <code>CFStringRefs</code> and
associated functions.

Increase the minimum alignment of each <var>variable</var> to <var>alignment</var>. 
This is the same as GCC's <code>aligned</code> attribute see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments to this pragma

<h4 class="subsection">6.61.9 Symbol-Renaming Pragmas</h4>

<p>GCC supports a <code>#pragma</code> directive that changes the name used in
assembly for a given declaration. While this pragma is supported on all
platforms, it is intended primarily to provide compatibility with the
Solaris system headers. This effect can also be achieved using the asm
labels extension (see <a href="#Asm-Labels">Asm Labels</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><code>redefine_extname </code><var>oldname</var> <var>newname</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-redefine_005fextname-4762"></a>
This pragma gives the C function <var>oldname</var> the assembly symbol
<var>newname</var>.  The preprocessor macro <code>__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME</code>
is defined if this pragma is available (currently on all platforms). 
</dl>

 <p>This pragma and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>This pragma silently applies only to declarations with external
linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.

     <li>In C++, this pragma silently applies only to declarations with
&ldquo;C&rdquo; linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.

     <li>If either of the ways of changing the assembly name of a
declaration are applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in order to
generate code), and the new name is different, a warning issues and
the name does not change.

     <li>The <var>oldname</var> used by <code>#pragma redefine_extname</code> is
always the C-language name.

<h4 class="subsection">6.61.10 Structure-Layout Pragmas</h4>

<p>For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports a
set of <code>#pragma</code> directives that change the maximum alignment of
members of structures (other than zero-width bit-fields), unions, and
classes subsequently defined. The <var>n</var> value below always is required
to be a small power of two and specifies the new alignment in bytes.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><code>#pragma pack(</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> simply sets the new alignment. 
<li><code>#pragma pack()</code> sets the alignment to the one that was in
effect when compilation started (see also command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-fpack-struct[=</span><var>n</var><span class="option">]</span></samp> see <a href="#Code-Gen-Options">Code Gen Options</a>). 
<li><code>#pragma pack(push[,</code><var>n</var><code>])</code> pushes the current alignment
setting on an internal stack and then optionally sets the new alignment. 
<li><code>#pragma pack(pop)</code> restores the alignment setting to the one
saved at the top of the internal stack (and removes that stack entry). 
Note that <code>#pragma pack([</code><var>n</var><code>])</code> does not influence this internal
stack; thus it is possible to have <code>#pragma pack(push)</code> followed by
multiple <code>#pragma pack(</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> instances and finalized by a single
<code>#pragma pack(pop)</code>.
      </ol>

 <p>Some targets, e.g. x86 and PowerPC, support the <code>#pragma ms_struct</code>
directive which lays out structures and unions subsequently defined as the
documented <code>__attribute__ ((ms_struct))</code>.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><code>#pragma ms_struct on</code> turns on the Microsoft layout. 
<li><code>#pragma ms_struct off</code> turns off the Microsoft layout. 
<li><code>#pragma ms_struct reset</code> goes back to the default layout.
      </ol>

 <p>Most targets also support the <code>#pragma scalar_storage_order</code> directive
which lays out structures and unions subsequently defined as the documented
<code>__attribute__ ((scalar_storage_order))</code>.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><code>#pragma scalar_storage_order big-endian</code> sets the storage order
of the scalar fields to big-endian. 
<li><code>#pragma scalar_storage_order little-endian</code> sets the storage order
of the scalar fields to little-endian. 
<li><code>#pragma scalar_storage_order default</code> goes back to the endianness
that was in effect when compilation started (see also command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-fsso-struct=</span><var>endianness</var></samp> see <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">C Dialect Options</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">6.61.12 Diagnostic Pragmas</h4>

<p>GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of
diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic.  For example, a
project's policy might require that all sources compile with
<samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> but certain files might have exceptions allowing
specific types of warnings.  Or, a project might selectively enable
diagnostics and treat them as errors depending on which preprocessor
macros are defined.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma GCC diagnostic </code><var>kind</var> <var>option</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-diagnostic-4764"></a>
Modifies the disposition of a diagnostic.  Note that not all
diagnostics are modifiable; at the moment only warnings (normally
controlled by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W...</span></samp>&rsquo;) can be controlled, and not all of them. 
Use <samp><span class="option">-fdiagnostics-show-option</span></samp> to determine which diagnostics
are controllable and which option controls them.

     <p><var>kind</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">error</span></samp>&rsquo; to treat this diagnostic as an error,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning</span></samp>&rsquo; to treat it like a warning (even if <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> is
in effect), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignored</span></samp>&rsquo; if the diagnostic is to be ignored. 
<var>option</var> is a double quoted string that matches the command-line
option.

     <pre class="smallexample">          #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wformat"
</pre>
     <p>Note that these pragmas override any command-line options.  GCC keeps
track of the location of each pragma, and issues diagnostics according
to the state as of that point in the source file.  Thus, pragmas occurring
after a line do not affect diagnostics caused by that line.

     <br><dt><code>#pragma GCC diagnostic push</code><dt><code>#pragma GCC diagnostic pop</code><dd>
Causes GCC to remember the state of the diagnostics as of each
<code>push</code>, and restore to that point at each <code>pop</code>.  If a
<code>pop</code> has no matching <code>push</code>, the command-line options are
restored.

     <pre class="smallexample">          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(a);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic push
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(b);                       /* no diagnostic for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(c);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(d);                       /* depends on command-line options */
</pre>
     </dl>

 <p>GCC also offers a simple mechanism for printing messages during
compilation.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma message </code><var>string</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-diagnostic-4765"></a>
Prints <var>string</var> as a compiler message on compilation.  The message
is informational only, and is neither a compilation warning nor an error.

     <pre class="smallexample">          #pragma message "Compiling " __FILE__ "..."
</pre>
     <p><var>string</var> may be parenthesized, and is printed with location
information.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
          #define TODO(x) DO_PRAGMA(message ("TODO - " #x))
          
          TODO(Remember to fix this)

<dt><code>#pragma GCC target (</code><var>"string"</var><code>...)</code><dd><a name="index-pragma-GCC-target-4769"></a>
This pragma allows you to set target specific options for functions
defined later in the source file.  One or more strings can be
specified.  Each function that is defined after this point is as
if <code>attribute((target("STRING")))</code> was specified for that
function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma GCC ivdep</code><dd><a name="index-pragma-GCC-ivdep-4774"></a>
With this pragma, the programmer asserts that there are no loop-carried
dependencies which would prevent consecutive iterations of
the following loop from executing concurrently with SIMD
(single instruction multiple data) instructions.

     <p>For example, the compiler can only unconditionally vectorize the following
loop with the pragma:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void foo (int n, int *a, int *b, int *c)
          {
            int i, j;
          #pragma GCC ivdep
            for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
              a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In this example, using the <code>restrict</code> qualifier had the same
effect. In the following example, that would not be possible. Assume
k &lt; -m or k &gt;= m. Only with the pragma, the compiler knows
that it can unconditionally vectorize the following loop:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void ignore_vec_dep (int *a, int k, int c, int m)
          {
          #pragma GCC ivdep
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)

It must be placed immediately before a <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>do</code>
loop or a <code>#pragma GCC ivdep</code>, and applies only to the loop that follows. 
<var>n</var> is an integer constant expression specifying the unrolling factor.

<h3 class="section">6.62 Unnamed Structure and Union Fields</h3>

As permitted by ISO C11 and for compatibility with other compilers,
GCC allows you to define
a structure or union that contains, as fields, structures and unions
without names.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this example, you are able to access members of the unnamed
union with code like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that only unnamed structs and
unions are allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed
<code>int</code>.

 <p>You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field definitions. 
For example, in this structure:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct {
       int a;
       struct {
         int a;
       };
     } foo;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">it is ambiguous which <code>a</code> is being referred to with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.a</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The compiler gives errors for such constructs.

 <p><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-4778"></a>Unless <samp><span class="option">-fms-extensions</span></samp> is used, the unnamed field must be a
structure or union definition without a tag (for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct
{ int a; };</span></samp>&rsquo;).  If <samp><span class="option">-fms-extensions</span></samp> is used, the field may
also be a definition with a tag such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct foo { int a;
};</span></samp>&rsquo;, a reference to a previously defined structure or union such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">struct foo;</span></samp>&rsquo;, or a reference to a <code>typedef</code> name for a
previously defined structure or union type.

 <p><a name="index-fplan9_002dextensions-4779"></a>The option <samp><span class="option">-fplan9-extensions</span></samp> enables
<samp><span class="option">-fms-extensions</span></samp> as well as two other extensions.  First, a
pointer to a structure is automatically converted to a pointer to an
anonymous field for assignments and function calls.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct s1 { int a; };
     struct s2 { struct s1; };
     extern void f1 (struct s1 *);
     void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In the call to <code>f1</code> inside <code>f2</code>, the pointer <code>p</code> is
converted into a pointer to the anonymous field.

 <p>Second, when the type of an anonymous field is a <code>typedef</code> for a
<code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>, code may refer to the field using the
name of the <code>typedef</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef struct { int a; } s1;
     struct s2 { s1; };
     s1 f1 (struct s2 *p) { return p-&gt;s1; }
</pre>
 <p>These usages are only permitted when they are not ambiguous.

Thread-local storage (<acronym>TLS</acronym>) is a mechanism by which variables
are allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The runtime model GCC uses to implement this originates
in the IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated
to other processors as well.  It requires significant support from
the linker (<samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>), dynamic linker (<samp><span class="command">ld.so</span></samp>), and
system libraries (<samp><span class="file">libc.so</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libpthread.so</span></samp>), so it
is not available everywhere.

 <p>At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage
class keyword: <code>__thread</code>.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     __thread int i;
     extern __thread struct state s;
     static __thread char *p;
</pre>
 <p>The <code>__thread</code> specifier may be used alone, with the <code>extern</code>
or <code>static</code> specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier. 
When used with <code>extern</code> or <code>static</code>, <code>__thread</code> must appear
immediately after the other storage class specifier.

 <p>The <code>__thread</code> specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It may
not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.

 <p>When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it is
evaluated at run time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local variables
in that thread become invalid.

 <p>No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local variable.

 <p>In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it must
be a <var>constant-expression</var>, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.

 <p>See <a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf">ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage</a> for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the runtime
is expected to function.

Integer constants can be written as binary constants, consisting of a

lot on the bit level (like microcontrollers).

 <p>The following statements are identical:

<pre class="smallexample">     i =       42;

 <p>The type of these constants follows the same rules as for octal or

The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and you
can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++ programs).  If you
want to write code that checks whether these features are available, you can
test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C programs: check for a
predefined macro <code>__GNUC__</code>.  You can also use <code>__GNUG__</code> to

<h3 class="section">7.1 When is a Volatile C++ Object Accessed?</h3>

<p><a name="index-accessing-volatiles-4786"></a><a name="index-volatile-read-4787"></a><a name="index-volatile-write-4788"></a><a name="index-volatile-access-4789"></a>
The C++ standard differs from the C standard in its treatment of
volatile objects.  It fails to specify what constitutes a volatile
access, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner to C
with respect to volatiles, where possible.  However, the different
lvalueness of expressions between C and C++ complicate the behavior. 
G++ behaves the same as GCC for volatile access, See <a href="#C-Extensions">Volatiles</a>, for a description of GCC's behavior.

 <p>The C and C++ language specifications differ when an object is
accessed in a void context:

<pre class="smallexample">     volatile int *src = <var>somevalue</var>;
     *src;
</pre>
 <p>The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo lvalue
to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced object may
be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly that it
is lvalue to rvalue conversion that is responsible for causing an
access.  There is reason to believe that it is, because otherwise
certain simple expressions become undefined.  However, because it
would surprise most programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a pointer to
volatile object of complete type as GCC would do for an equivalent
type in C.  When the object has incomplete type, G++ issues a
warning; if you wish to force an error, you must force a conversion to
rvalue with, for instance, a static cast.

 <p>When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.

 <p>G++ implements the same behavior as GCC does when assigning to a
volatile object&mdash;there is no reread of the assigned-to object, the
assigned rvalue is reused.  Note that in C++ assignment expressions
are lvalues, and if used as an lvalue, the volatile object is
referred to.  For instance, <var>vref</var> refers to <var>vobj</var>, as
expected, in the following example:

<pre class="smallexample">     volatile int vobj;
     volatile int &amp;vref = vobj = <var>something</var>;

<h3 class="section">7.2 Restricting Pointer Aliasing</h3>

<p><a name="index-restricted-pointers-4790"></a><a name="index-restricted-references-4791"></a><a name="index-restricted-this-pointer-4792"></a>
As with the C front end, G++ understands the C99 feature of restricted pointers,
specified with the <code>__restrict__</code>, or <code>__restrict</code> type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp>
language flag, <code>restrict</code> is not a keyword in C++.

 <p>In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the local
context.

<pre class="smallexample">     void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &amp;__restrict__ rref)
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In the body of <code>fn</code>, <var>rptr</var> points to an unaliased integer and
<var>rref</var> refers to a (different) unaliased integer.

 <p>You may also specify whether a member function's <var>this</var> pointer is
unaliased by using <code>__restrict__</code> as a member function qualifier.

<pre class="smallexample">     void T::fn () __restrict__
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Within the body of <code>T::fn</code>, <var>this</var> has the effective
definition <code>T *__restrict__ const this</code>.  Notice that the
interpretation of a <code>__restrict__</code> member function qualifier is
different to that of <code>const</code> or <code>volatile</code> qualifier, in that it
is applied to the pointer rather than the object.  This is consistent with
other compilers that implement restricted pointers.

 <p>As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, <code>__restrict__</code> is
ignored in function definition matching.  This means you only need to
specify <code>__restrict__</code> in a function definition, rather than
in a function prototype as well.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Vague Linkage</h3>

<p><a name="index-vague-linkage-4793"></a>
There are several constructs in C++ that require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have &ldquo;vague linkage&rdquo;.  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.

     <dl>
<dt>Inline Functions<dd>Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can be
included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can usually be
inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary, if the address
of the function is taken or if inlining fails.  In general, we emit an
out-of-line copy in all translation units where one is needed.  As an
exception, we only emit inline virtual functions with the vtable, since
it always requires a copy.

     <p>Local static variables and string constants used in an inline function
are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must be shared
between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the function.

     <br><dt>VTables<dd><a name="index-vtable-4794"></a>C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a lookup
table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to the virtual
functions provided by a class, and each object of the class contains a
pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some multiple-inheritance
situations).  If the class declares any non-inline, non-pure virtual
functions, the first one is chosen as the &ldquo;key method&rdquo; for the class,
and the vtable is only emitted in the translation unit where the key
method is defined.

     <p><em>Note:</em> If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
vtable is still emitted in every translation unit that defines it. 
Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
body, even if they are not defined there.

     <br><dt><code>type_info</code> objects<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btype_005finfo_007d-4795"></a><a name="index-RTTI-4796"></a>C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
implement &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeid</span></samp>&rsquo; and exception handling. 
For polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type_info</span></samp>&rsquo;
object is written out along with the vtable so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span></samp>&rsquo;
can determine the dynamic type of a class object at run time.  For all
other types, we write out the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type_info</span></samp>&rsquo; object when it is used: when
applying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeid</span></samp>&rsquo; to an expression, throwing an object, or
referring to a type in a catch clause or exception specification.

     <br><dt>Template Instantiations<dd>Most everything in this section also applies to template instantiations,
but there are other options as well. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Where's the Template?</a>.

 </dl>

 <p>When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.

 <p>On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
uses them.  This way one copy overrides all the others, but
the unused copies still take up space in the executable.

 <p>For targets that do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols,
most entities with vague linkage are emitted as local symbols to
avoid duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This does not happen
for local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies
almost certainly breaks things.

 <p>See <a href="#C_002b_002b-Interface">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</a>, for
another way to control placement of these constructs.

<code>#pragma interface</code> and <code>#pragma implementation</code> provide the
user with a way of explicitly directing the compiler to emit entities
with vague linkage (and debugging information) in a particular
translation unit.

 <p><em>Note:</em> These <code>#pragma</code>s have been superceded as of GCC 2.7.2
by COMDAT support and the &ldquo;key method&rdquo; heuristic
mentioned in <a href="#Vague-Linkage">Vague Linkage</a>.  Using them can actually cause your
program to grow due to unnecessary out-of-line copies of inline
functions.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma interface</code><dt><code>#pragma interface "</code><var>subdir</var><code>/</code><var>objects</var><code>.h"</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023pragma-interface-4800"></a>Use this directive in <em>header files</em> that define object classes, to save
space in most of the object files that use those classes.  Normally,
local copies of certain information (backup copies of inline member
functions, debugging information, and the internal tables that implement
virtual functions) must be kept in each object file that includes class
definitions.  You can use this pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a
header file containing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma interface</span></samp>&rsquo; is included in a
compilation, this auxiliary information is not generated (unless
the main input source file itself uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Instead, the object files contain references to be resolved at link
time.

     <p>The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you have
multiple headers with the same name in different directories.  If you
use this form, you must specify the same string to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma
implementation</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>#pragma implementation</code><dt><code>#pragma implementation "</code><var>objects</var><code>.h"</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023pragma-implementation-4801"></a>Use this pragma in a <em>main input file</em>, when you want full output from
included header files to be generated (and made globally visible).  The
included header file, in turn, should use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma interface</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging information, and the
internal tables used to implement virtual functions are all generated in
implementation files.

     <p><a name="index-implied-_0040code_007b_0023pragma-implementation_007d-4802"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023pragma-implementation_007d_002c-implied-4803"></a><a name="index-naming-convention_002c-implementation-headers-4804"></a>If you use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span></samp>&rsquo; with no argument, it applies to
an include file with the same basename<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a> as your source
file.  For example, in <samp><span class="file">allclass.cc</span></samp>, giving just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span></samp>&rsquo;
by itself is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma implementation "allclass.h"</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; to include the header file; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma

include it.)

effect on function inlining.

 <p>If you define a class in a header file marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma
interface</span></samp>&rsquo;, the effect on an inline function defined in that class is
similar to an explicit <code>extern</code> declaration&mdash;the compiler emits
no code at all to define an independent version of the function.  Its
definition is used only for inlining with its callers.

 <p><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-4808"></a>Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span></samp>&rsquo;, the compiler emits
code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
emitting the function by compiling with <samp><span class="option">-fno-implement-inlines</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">7.5 Where's the Template?</h3>

<p><a name="index-template-instantiation-4809"></a>
C++ templates were the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than was traditionally found on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which are referred to as the Borland model and the Cfront model.

     <dl>
<dt>Borland model<dd>Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the code
equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler emits template
instances in each translation unit that uses them, and the linker
collapses them together.  The advantage of this model is that the linker
only has to consider the object files themselves; there is no external
complexity to worry about.  The disadvantage is that compilation time
is increased because the template code is being compiled repeatedly. 
Code written for this model tends to include definitions of all
templates in the header file, since they must be seen to be
instantiated.

     <br><dt>Cfront model<dd>The AT&amp;T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.  A
more modern version of the repository works as follows: As individual
object files are built, the compiler places any template definitions and
instantiations encountered in the repository.  At link time, the link
wrapper adds in the objects in the repository and compiles any needed
instances that were not previously emitted.  The advantages of this
model are more optimal compilation speed and the ability to use the
system linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to build
multiple programs in one directory and one program in multiple
directories.  Code written for this model tends to separate definitions
of non-inline member templates into a separate file, which should be
compiled separately. 
</dl>

 <p>G++ implements the Borland model on targets where the linker supports it,
including ELF targets (such as GNU/Linux), Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. 
Otherwise G++ implements neither automatic model.

 <p>You have the following options for dealing with template instantiations:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Do nothing.  Code written for the Borland model works fine, but
each translation unit contains instances of each of the templates it
uses.  The duplicate instances will be discarded by the linker, but in
a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable amount of code
duplication in object files or shared libraries.

     <p>Duplicate instances of a template can be avoided by defining an explicit
instantiation in one object file, and preventing the compiler from doing
implicit instantiations in any other object files by using an explicit
instantiation declaration, using the <code>extern template</code> syntax:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern template int max (int, int);
</pre>
     <p>This syntax is defined in the C++ 2011 standard, but has been supported by
G++ and other compilers since well before 2011.

     <p>Explicit instantiations can be used for the largest or most frequently
duplicated instances, without having to know exactly which other instances
are used in the rest of the program.  You can scatter the explicit
instantiations throughout your program, perhaps putting them in the
translation units where the instances are used or the translation units
that define the templates themselves; you can put all of the explicit
instantiations you need into one big file; or you can create small files
like

     <pre class="smallexample">          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"
          
          template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
          template ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt;
                          (ostream&amp;, const Foo&lt;int&gt;&amp;);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">for each of the instances you need, and create a template instantiation
library from those.

     <p>This is the simplest option, but also offers flexibility and
fine-grained control when necessary. It is also the most portable
alternative and programs using this approach will work with most modern
compilers.

     <li><a name="index-frepo-4810"></a>Compile your template-using code with <samp><span class="option">-frepo</span></samp>.  The compiler
generates files with the extension &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.rpo</span></samp>&rsquo; listing all of the
template instantiations used in the corresponding object files that
could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">collect2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then updates the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.rpo</span></samp>&rsquo; files to tell the compiler where to place
those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the compiler
continues to place the instantiations in the same files.

     <p>This can be a suitable option for application code written for the Borland
model, as it usually just works.  Code written for the Cfront model
needs to be modified so that the template definitions are available at
one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple as adding
<code>#include &lt;tmethods.cc&gt;</code> to the end of each template header.

     <p>For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the template
instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its object files
together; the link will fail, but cause the instantiations to be
generated as a side effect.  Be warned, however, that this may cause
conflicts if multiple libraries try to provide the same instantiations. 
For greater control, use explicit instantiation as described in the next
option.

     <li><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-4811"></a>Compile your code with <samp><span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span></samp> to disable the
implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly instantiate
all the ones you use.  This approach requires more knowledge of exactly
which instances you need than do the others, but it's less
mysterious and allows greater control if you want to ensure that only
the intended instances are used.

     <p>If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with not
using <samp><span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span></samp> when compiling files that don't
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; the member template definitions.

     <p>If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
compile it without <samp><span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span></samp> so you get all of the
instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
other files) without having to specify them as well.

     <p>In addition to forward declaration of explicit instantiations
(with <code>extern</code>), G++ has extended the template instantiation
syntax to support instantiation of the compiler support data for a
template class (i.e. the vtable) without instantiating any of its
members (with <code>inline</code>), and instantiation of only the static data
members of a template class, without the support data or member
functions (with <code>static</code>):

     <pre class="smallexample">          inline template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
          static template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
</pre>
     </ol>

<h3 class="section">7.6 Extracting the Function Pointer from a Bound Pointer to Member Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-pmf-4812"></a><a name="index-pointer-to-member-function-4813"></a><a name="index-bound-pointer-to-member-function-4814"></a>
In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>&rsquo; pointer,
and if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

 <p>Note that you still pay the penalty for the call through a
function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the
branch prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal
virtual function calls.

 <p>The syntax for this extension is

<pre class="smallexample">     extern A a;
     extern int (A::*fp)();
     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);
     
     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);
</pre>
 <p>For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;Klasse::Member</span></samp>&rsquo;),
no object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:

<pre class="smallexample">     fptr p1 = (fptr)(&amp;A::foo);
</pre>
 <p><a name="index-Wno_002dpmf_002dconversions-4815"></a>You must specify <samp><span class="option">-Wno-pmf-conversions</span></samp> to use this extension.

<h3 class="section">7.7 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes</h3>

<p>Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.

     <dl>
<dt><code>abi_tag ("</code><var>tag</var><code>", ...)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007babi_005ftag_007d-function-attribute-4816"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007babi_005ftag_007d-variable-attribute-4817"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007babi_005ftag_007d-type-attribute-4818"></a>The <code>abi_tag</code> attribute can be applied to a function, variable, or class
declaration.  It modifies the mangled name of the entity to
incorporate the tag name, in order to distinguish the function or
class from an earlier version with a different ABI; perhaps the class
has changed size, or the function has a different return type that is
not encoded in the mangled name.

     <p>The attribute can also be applied to an inline namespace, but does not
affect the mangled name of the namespace; in this case it is only used
for <samp><span class="option">-Wabi-tag</span></samp> warnings and automatic tagging of functions and
variables.  Tagging inline namespaces is generally preferable to
tagging individual declarations, but the latter is sometimes
necessary, such as when only certain members of a class need to be
tagged.

     <p>The argument can be a list of strings of arbitrary length.  The
strings are sorted on output, so the order of the list is
unimportant.

     <p>A redeclaration of an entity must not add new ABI tags,
since doing so would change the mangled name.

     <p>The ABI tags apply to a name, so all instantiations and
specializations of a template have the same tags.  The attribute will
be ignored if applied to an explicit specialization or instantiation.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-Wabi-tag</span></samp> flag enables a warning about a class which does
not have all the ABI tags used by its subobjects and virtual functions; for users with code
that needs to coexist with an earlier ABI, using this option can help
to find all affected types that need to be tagged.

     <p>When a type involving an ABI tag is used as the type of a variable or
return type of a function where that tag is not already present in the
signature of the function, the tag is automatically applied to the
variable or function.  <samp><span class="option">-Wabi-tag</span></samp> also warns about this
situation; this warning can be avoided by explicitly tagging the
variable or function or moving it into a tagged inline namespace.

     <br><dt><code>init_priority (</code><var>priority</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binit_005fpriority_007d-variable-attribute-4819"></a>
In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed to be
initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of their definitions
<em>in a given translation unit</em>.  No guarantee is made for initializations
across translation units.  However, GNU C++ allows users to control the
order of initialization of objects defined at namespace scope with the
<code>init_priority</code> attribute by specifying a relative <var>priority</var>,
a constant integral expression currently bounded between 101 and 65535
inclusive.  Lower numbers indicate a higher priority.

     <p>In the following example, <code>A</code> would normally be created before
<code>B</code>, but the <code>init_priority</code> attribute reverses that order:

     <pre class="smallexample">          Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
          Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that the particular values of <var>priority</var> do not matter; only their
relative ordering.

     <br><dt><code>warn_unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwarn_005funused_007d-type-attribute-4820"></a>
For C++ types with non-trivial constructors and/or destructors it is
impossible for the compiler to determine whether a variable of this
type is truly unused if it is not referenced. This type attribute
informs the compiler that variables of this type should be warned
about if they appear to be unused, just like variables of fundamental
types.

     <p>This attribute is appropriate for types which just represent a value,
such as <code>std::string</code>; it is not appropriate for types which
control a resource, such as <code>std::lock_guard</code>.

     <p>This attribute is also accepted in C, but it is unnecessary because C
does not have constructors or destructors.

<h3 class="section">7.8 Function Multiversioning</h3>

<p><a name="index-function-versions-4821"></a>
With the GNU C++ front end, for x86 targets, you may specify multiple
versions of a function, where each function is specialized for a
specific target feature.  At runtime, the appropriate version of the
function is automatically executed depending on the characteristics of
the execution platform.  Here is an example.

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__ ((target ("default")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // The default version of foo.
       return 0;
     }
     
     __attribute__ ((target ("sse4.2")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for SSE4.2
       return 1;
     }
     
     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=atom")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the Intel ATOM processor
       return 2;
     }
     
     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=amdfam10")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the AMD Family 0x10 processors.
       return 3;
     }
     
     int main ()
     {
       int (*p)() = &amp;foo;
       assert ((*p) () == foo ());
       return 0;
     }
</pre>
 <p>In the above example, four versions of function foo are created. The
first version of foo with the target attribute "default" is the default
version.  This version gets executed when no other target specific
version qualifies for execution on a particular platform. A new version
of foo is created by using the same function signature but with a
different target string.  Function foo is called or a pointer to it is
taken just like a regular function.  GCC takes care of doing the
dispatching to call the right version at runtime.  Refer to the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FunctionMultiVersioning">GCC wiki on Function Multiversioning</a> for more details.

<p>C++ concepts provide much-improved support for generic programming. In
particular, they allow the specification of constraints on template arguments. 
The constraints are used to extend the usual overloading and partial
specialization capabilities of the language, allowing generic data structures

type names.

 <p>The following keywords are reserved for concepts.

     <br><dt><code>forall</code><dd>Introduces a universally quantified object in an axiom. For example,
<code>forall (int n) n + 0 == n</code>).

<h3 class="section">7.11 Deprecated Features</h3>

<p>In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

 <p>While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the options
that are now deprecated or have been removed:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code><dt><code>-ffriend-injection</code><dd>These two options provide compatibility with pre-standard C++. 
See <a href="#Backwards-Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</a>.

 </dl>

 <p>G++ allows a virtual function returning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">void *</span></samp>&rsquo; to be overridden
by one returning a different pointer type.  This extension to the
covariant return type rules is now deprecated and will be removed from a
future version.

 <p>The use of default arguments in function pointers, function typedefs
and other places where they are not permitted by the standard is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version of G++.

 <p>G++ allows floating-point literals to appear in integral constant expressions,
e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> enum E { e = int(2.2 * 3.7) } </span></samp>&rsquo;
This extension is deprecated and will be removed from a future version.

 <p>G++ allows static data members of const floating-point type to be declared
with an initializer in a class definition. The standard only allows
initializers for static members of const integral types and const
enumeration types so this extension has been deprecated and will be removed
from a future version.

 <p>G++ allows attributes to follow a parenthesized direct initializer,
e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> int f (0) __attribute__ ((something)); </span></samp>&rsquo; This extension
has been ignored since G++ 3.3 and is deprecated.

 <p>G++ allows anonymous structs and unions to have members that are not
public non-static data members (i.e. fields).  These extensions are
deprecated.

Now that there is a definitive ISO standard C++, G++ has a specification
to adhere to.  The C++ language evolved over time, and features that
used to be acceptable in previous drafts of the standard, such as the ARM
[Annotated C++ Reference Manual], are no longer accepted.  In order to allow
compilation of C++ written to such drafts, G++ contains some backwards
compatibilities.  <em>All such backwards compatibility features are
liable to disappear in future versions of G++.</em> They should be considered
deprecated.   See <a href="#Deprecated-Features">Deprecated Features</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>For scope</code><dd>If a variable is declared at for scope, it used to remain in scope
until the end of the scope that contained the for statement (rather
than just within the for scope).  The deprecated
<samp><span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span></samp> option enables this non-standard behavior. 
Without the option, G++ retains this, but issues a warning, if such a
variable is accessed outside the for scope.

     <p>The behavior is deprecated, only available with <samp><span class="option">-std=c++98</span></samp>
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu++98</span></samp> languages and you must use the
<samp><span class="option">-fpermissive</span></samp> option to enable it.  The behavior will be
removed.

     <br><dt><code>Friend Injection</code><dd>The <samp><span class="option">-ffriend-injection</span></samp> option makes injected friends visible
to regular name lookup, unlike standard C++.  This option is
deprecated and will be removed.

     <br><dt><code>Implicit C language</code><dd>Old C system header files did not contain an <code>extern "C" {...}</code>
scope to set the language.  On such systems, all header files are
implicitly scoped inside a C language scope.  Also, an empty prototype
<code>()</code> is treated as an unspecified number of arguments, rather
than no arguments, as C++ demands.

<h3 class="section">8.1 GNU Objective-C Runtime API</h3>

<p>This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 <p>The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API that allows you to
interact with the Objective-C runtime system, querying the live
runtime structures and even manipulating them.  This allows you for
example to inspect and navigate classes, methods and protocols; to
define new classes or new methods, and even to modify existing classes
or protocols.

 <p>If you are using a &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo; library such as GNUstep-Base, this
library will provide you with a rich set of functionality to do most
of the inspection tasks, and you probably will only need direct access
to the GNU Objective-C runtime API to define new classes or methods.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 Modern GNU Objective-C Runtime API</h4>

<p>The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API which is similar to the
one provided by the &ldquo;Objective-C 2.0&rdquo; Apple/NeXT Objective-C
runtime.  The API is documented in the public header files of the GNU
Objective-C runtime:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">objc/objc.h</span></samp>: this is the basic Objective-C header file,
defining the basic Objective-C types such as <code>id</code>, <code>Class</code>
and <code>BOOL</code>.  You have to include this header to do almost
anything with Objective-C.

     <li><samp><span class="file">objc/runtime.h</span></samp>: this header declares most of the public runtime
API functions allowing you to inspect and manipulate the Objective-C
runtime data structures.  These functions are fairly standardized
across Objective-C runtimes and are almost identical to the Apple/NeXT
Objective-C runtime ones.  It does not declare functions in some
specialized areas (constructing and forwarding message invocations,
threading) which are in the other headers below.  You have to include
<samp><span class="file">objc/objc.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">objc/runtime.h</span></samp> to use any of the
functions, such as <code>class_getName()</code>, declared in
<samp><span class="file">objc/runtime.h</span></samp>.

     <li><samp><span class="file">objc/message.h</span></samp>: this header declares public functions used to
construct, deconstruct and forward message invocations.  Because
messaging is done in quite a different way on different runtimes,
functions in this header are specific to the GNU Objective-C runtime
implementation.

     <li><samp><span class="file">objc/objc-exception.h</span></samp>: this header declares some public
functions related to Objective-C exceptions.  For example functions in
this header allow you to throw an Objective-C exception from plain
C/C++ code.

     <li><samp><span class="file">objc/objc-sync.h</span></samp>: this header declares some public functions
related to the Objective-C <code>@synchronized()</code> syntax, allowing
you to emulate an Objective-C <code>@synchronized()</code> block in plain
C/C++ code.

     <li><samp><span class="file">objc/thr.h</span></samp>: this header declares a public runtime API threading
layer that is only provided by the GNU Objective-C runtime.  It
declares functions such as <code>objc_mutex_lock()</code>, which provide a
platform-independent set of threading functions.

 </ul>

 <p>The header files contain detailed documentation for each function in
the GNU Objective-C runtime API.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.2 Traditional GNU Objective-C Runtime API</h4>

<p>The GNU Objective-C runtime used to provide a different API, which we
call the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; GNU Objective-C runtime API.  Functions
belonging to this API are easy to recognize because they use a
different naming convention, such as <code>class_get_super_class()</code>
(traditional API) instead of <code>class_getSuperclass()</code> (modern
API).  Software using this API includes the file
<samp><span class="file">objc/objc-api.h</span></samp> where it is declared.

 <p>Starting with GCC 4.7.0, the traditional GNU runtime API is no longer
available.

<h3 class="section">8.2 <code>+load</code>: Executing Code before <code>main</code></h3>

<p>This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 <p>The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the <code>main</code>
function.  The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis,
through a special class method <code>+load</code>.

 <p>This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global variables
which can be accessed by the program directly, without sending a message
to the class first.  The usual way to initialize global variables, in the
<code>+initialize</code> method, might not be useful because
<code>+initialize</code> is only called when the first message is sent to a
class object, which in some cases could be too late.

 <p>Suppose for example you have a <code>FileStream</code> class that declares
<code>Stdin</code>, <code>Stdout</code> and <code>Stderr</code> as global variables, like
below:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     FileStream *Stdin = nil;
     FileStream *Stdout = nil;
     FileStream *Stderr = nil;
     
     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* <span class="roman">Other methods here</span> */
     @end
     
</pre>
 <p>In this example, the initialization of <code>Stdin</code>, <code>Stdout</code> and
<code>Stderr</code> in <code>+initialize</code> occurs too late.  The programmer can
send a message to one of these objects before the variables are actually
initialized, thus sending messages to the <code>nil</code> object.  The
<code>+initialize</code> method which actually initializes the global
variables is not invoked until the first message is sent to the class
object.  The solution would require these variables to be initialized
just before entering <code>main</code>.

 <p>The correct solution of the above problem is to use the <code>+load</code>
method instead of <code>+initialize</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)load
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* <span class="roman">Other methods here</span> */
     @end
     
</pre>
 <p>The <code>+load</code> is a method that is not overridden by categories.  If a
class and a category of it both implement <code>+load</code>, both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.

 <p>This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for <code>+initialize</code>. 
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it
instead of <code>+initialize</code>.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 What You Can and Cannot Do in <code>+load</code></h4>

<p><code>+load</code> is to be used only as a last resort.  Because it is
executed very early, most of the Objective-C runtime machinery will
not be ready when <code>+load</code> is executed; hence <code>+load</code> works
best for executing C code that is independent on the Objective-C
runtime.

 <p>The <code>+load</code> implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the
following things:

     <ul>
<li>you can write whatever C code you like;

     <li>you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is implemented
in the same file;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of all super classes of a class are
executed before the <code>+load</code> of that class is executed;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of a class is executed before the
<code>+load</code> implementation of any category.

 </ul>

 <p>In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

     <ul>
<li>allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

     <li>allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
category implemented in the same file;

     <li>sending messages to Objective-C constant strings (<code>@"this is a
constant string"</code>);

 </ul>

 <p>You should make no assumptions about receiving <code>+load</code> in sibling
classes when you write <code>+load</code> of a class.  The order in which
sibling classes receive <code>+load</code> is not guaranteed.

 <p>The order in which <code>+load</code> and <code>+initialize</code> are called could
be problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
<code>+load</code>, it is guaranteed that <code>+load</code> is called before
<code>+initialize</code>.  If you create an object inside <code>+load</code> the
<code>+initialize</code> method of object's class is invoked even if
<code>+load</code> was not invoked.  Note if you explicitly call <code>+load</code>
on a class, <code>+initialize</code> will be called first.  To avoid possible
problems try to implement only one of these methods.

 <p>The <code>+load</code> method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically
loaded into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write <code>+load</code> you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Type Encoding</h3>

<p>This is an advanced section.  Type encodings are used extensively by
the compiler and by the runtime, but you generally do not need to know
about them to use Objective-C.

 <p>The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the types. 
These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information about
selectors and methods and about objects and classes.

 <p>The types are encoded in the following way:

 <br></td></tr></table>

<!-- @sp 1 -->
 <p>The encoding of bit-fields has changed to allow bit-fields to be
properly handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and
alignments of types that contain bit-fields.  The previous encoding
contained only the size of the bit-field.  Using only this information
it is not possible to reliably compute the size occupied by the
bit-field.  This is very important in the presence of the Boehm's
garbage collector because the objects are allocated using the typed
memory facility available in this collector.  The typed memory
allocation requires information about where the pointers are located
inside the object.

 <p>The position in the bit-field is the position, counting in bits, of the
bit closest to the beginning of the structure.

 <p>The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:

<!-- @sp 1 -->

 <p>Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on an i386 machine:

In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type
specifiers.  The table below describes the encoding of the current
Objective-C type specifiers:

 <br></td></tr></table>

 <pre class="sp">

</pre>

The type specifiers are encoded just before the type.  Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.

 <p>Note how <code>const</code> interacts with pointers:

 <pre class="sp">

</pre>
 <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Objective-C type
</td><td valign="top" width="75%">Compiler encoding

</pre>
 <p></td><td valign="top" width="75%"><code>r^i</code>
 <br></td></tr></table>

 <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<code>const int*</code> is a pointer to a <code>const int</code>, and so is
encoded as <code>^ri</code>.  <code>int* const</code>, instead, is a <code>const</code>
pointer to an <code>int</code>, and so is encoded as <code>r^i</code>.

 <p>Finally, there is a complication when encoding <code>const char *</code>
versus <code>char * const</code>.  Because <code>char *</code> is encoded as
<code>*</code> and not as <code>^c</code>, there is no way to express the fact
that <code>r</code> applies to the pointer or to the pointee.

 <p>Hence, it is assumed as a convention that <code>r*</code> means <code>const
char *</code> (since it is what is most often meant), and there is no way to
encode <code>char *const</code>.  <code>char *const</code> would simply be encoded
as <code>*</code>, and the <code>const</code> is lost.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.1 Legacy Type Encoding</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, historically GCC used to have a number of bugs in its
encoding code.  The NeXT runtime expects GCC to emit type encodings in
this historical format (compatible with GCC-3.3), so when using the
NeXT runtime, GCC will introduce on purpose a number of incorrect
encodings:

     <ul>
<li>the read-only qualifier of the pointee gets emitted before the '^'. 
The read-only qualifier of the pointer itself gets ignored, unless it
is a typedef.  Also, the 'r' is only emitted for the outermost type.

     <li>32-bit longs are encoded as 'l' or 'L', but not always.  For typedefs,
the compiler uses 'i' or 'I' instead if encoding a struct field or a
pointer.

     <li><code>enum</code>s are always encoded as 'i' (int) even if they are actually
unsigned or long.

 </ul>

 <p>In addition to that, the NeXT runtime uses a different encoding for
bitfields.  It encodes them as <code>b</code> followed by the size, without
a bit offset or the underlying field type.

<p>GNU Objective-C supports the <code>@encode</code> syntax that allows you to
create a type encoding from a C/Objective-C type.  For example,
<code>@encode(int)</code> is compiled by the compiler into <code>"i"</code>.

 <p><code>@encode</code> does not support type qualifiers other than
<code>const</code>.  For example, <code>@encode(const char*)</code> is valid and
is compiled into <code>"r*"</code>, while <code>@encode(bycopy char *)</code> is
invalid and will cause a compilation error.

<p>This section documents the encoding of method types, which is rarely
needed to use Objective-C.  You should skip it at a first reading; the
runtime provides functions that will work on methods and can walk
through the list of parameters and interpret them for you.  These
functions are part of the public &ldquo;API&rdquo; and are the preferred way to
interact with method signatures from user code.

 <p>But if you need to debug a problem with method signatures and need to
know how they are implemented (i.e., the &ldquo;ABI&rdquo;), read on.

 <p>Methods have their &ldquo;signature&rdquo; encoded and made available to the
runtime.  The &ldquo;signature&rdquo; encodes all the information required to
dynamically build invocations of the method at runtime: return type
and arguments.

 <p>The &ldquo;signature&rdquo; is a null-terminated string, composed of the following:

     <ul>
<li>The return type, including type qualifiers.  For example, a method
returning <code>int</code> would have <code>i</code> here.

     <li>The total size (in bytes) required to pass all the parameters.  This
includes the two hidden parameters (the object <code>self</code> and the
method selector <code>_cmd</code>).

     <li>Each argument, with the type encoding, followed by the offset (in
bytes) of the argument in the list of parameters.

 </ul>

 <p>For example, a method with no arguments and returning <code>int</code> would
have the signature <code>i8@0:4</code> if the size of a pointer is 4.  The
signature is interpreted as follows: the <code>i</code> is the return type
(an <code>int</code>), the <code>8</code> is the total size of the parameters in
bytes (two pointers each of size 4), the <code>@0</code> is the first
parameter (an object at byte offset <code>0</code>) and <code>:4</code> is the
second parameter (a <code>SEL</code> at byte offset <code>4</code>).

 <p>You can easily find more examples by running the &ldquo;strings&rdquo; program
on an Objective-C object file compiled by GCC.  You'll see a lot of
strings that look very much like <code>i8@0:4</code>.  They are signatures
of Objective-C methods.

<h3 class="section">8.4 Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 <p>Support for garbage collection with the GNU runtime has been added by
using a powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.

 <p>To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler using
an additional argument, <samp><span class="option">--enable-objc-gc</span></samp><!-- /@w -->.  This will
build the boehm-gc library, and build an additional runtime library
which has several enhancements to support the garbage collector.  The
new library has a new name, <samp><span class="file">libobjc_gc.a</span></samp> to not conflict with
the non-garbage-collected library.

 <p>When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using the
so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.  This mode requires precise information on
where pointers are located inside objects.  This information is computed
once per class, immediately after the class has been initialized.

 <p>There is a new runtime function <code>class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()</code>
which can be used to declare a so-called <dfn>weak pointer</dfn>
reference.  Such a pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector;
this can be useful in certain situations, especially when you want to
keep track of the allocated objects, yet allow them to be
collected.  This kind of pointers can only be members of objects, you
cannot declare a global pointer as a weak reference.  Every type which is
a pointer type can be declared a weak pointer, including <code>id</code>,
<code>Class</code> and <code>SEL</code>.

 <p>Here is an example of how to use this feature.  Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     @interface WeakPointer : Object
     {
         const void* weakPointer;
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
     - (const void*)weakPointer;
     @end
     
     
     @implementation WeakPointer
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
       if (self == objc_lookUpClass ("WeakPointer"))
         class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p
     {
       weakPointer = p;
       return self;
     }
     
     - (const void*)weakPointer
     {
       return weakPointer;
     }
     
     @end
     
</pre>
 <p>Weak pointers are supported through a new type character specifier
represented by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  The
<code>class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()</code> function adds or removes this
specifier to the string type description of the instance variable named
as argument.

<h3 class="section">8.5 Constant String Objects</h3>

<p>GNU Objective-C provides constant string objects that are generated
directly by the compiler.  You declare a constant string object by
prefixing a C constant string with the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">       id myString = @"this is a constant string object";
</pre>
 <p>The constant string objects are by default instances of the
<code>NXConstantString</code> class which is provided by the GNU Objective-C
runtime.  To get the definition of this class you must include the
<samp><span class="file">objc/NXConstStr.h</span></samp> header file.

 <p>User defined libraries may want to implement their own constant string
class.  To be able to support them, the GNU Objective-C compiler provides
a new command line options <samp><span class="option">-fconstant-string-class=</span><var>class-name</var></samp>. 
The provided class should adhere to a strict structure, the same
as <code>NXConstantString</code>'s structure:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     @interface MyConstantStringClass
     {
       Class isa;
       char *c_string;
       unsigned int len;
     }
     @end
     
</pre>
 <p><code>NXConstantString</code> inherits from <code>Object</code>; user class
libraries may choose to inherit the customized constant string class
from a different class than <code>Object</code>.  There is no requirement in
the methods the constant string class has to implement, but the final
ivar layout of the class must be the compatible with the given
structure.

 <p>When the compiler creates the statically allocated constant string
object, the <code>c_string</code> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string; the <code>length</code> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string length; the <code>isa</code> pointer will be filled with
<code>NULL</code> by the compiler, and it will later be fixed up automatically
at runtime by the GNU Objective-C runtime library to point to the class
which was set by the <samp><span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span></samp> option when the
object file is loaded (if you wonder how it works behind the scenes, the
name of the class to use, and the list of static objects to fixup, are
stored by the compiler in the object file in a place where the GNU
runtime library will find them at runtime).

 <p>As a result, when a file is compiled with the
<samp><span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span></samp> option, all the constant string objects
will be instances of the class specified as argument to this option.  It
is possible to have multiple compilation units referring to different
constant string classes, neither the compiler nor the linker impose any
restrictions in doing this.

<h3 class="section">8.6 <code>compatibility_alias</code></h3>

<p>The keyword <code>@compatibility_alias</code> allows you to define a class name
as equivalent to another class name.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     @compatibility_alias WOApplication GSWApplication;
</pre>
 <p>tells the compiler that each time it encounters <code>WOApplication</code> as
a class name, it should replace it with <code>GSWApplication</code> (that is,
<code>WOApplication</code> is just an alias for <code>GSWApplication</code>).

 <p>There are some constraints on how this can be used&mdash;

     <ul>
<li><code>WOApplication</code> (the alias) must not be an existing class;

     <li><code>GSWApplication</code> (the real class) must be an existing class.

<h3 class="section">8.7 Exceptions</h3>

<p>GNU Objective-C provides exception support built into the language, as
in the following example:

<pre class="smallexample">       @try {
         ...
            @throw expr;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
           @throw;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
         ...
       }
       @catch (id allOthers) {
         ...
       }
       @finally {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
       }
</pre>
 <p>The <code>@throw</code> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a <code>@catch</code> block, the
<code>@throw</code> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in
which case the object caught by the <code>@catch</code> will be rethrown.

 <p>Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <code>@catch</code> clause capable of handling objects of
that type, analogously to how <code>catch</code> blocks work in C++ and
Java.  A <code>@catch(id ...)</code> clause (as shown above) may also
be provided to catch any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by
previous <code>@catch</code> clauses (if any).

 <p>The <code>@finally</code> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit
from the immediately preceding <code>@try ... @catch</code> section. 
This will happen regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown,
caught or rethrown inside the <code>@try ... @catch</code> section,
analogously to the behavior of the <code>finally</code> clause in Java.

 <p>There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

     <ul>
<li>The <samp><span class="option">-fobjc-exceptions</span></samp> command line option must be used when
compiling Objective-C files that use exceptions.

     <li>With the GNU runtime, exceptions are always implemented as &ldquo;native&rdquo;
exceptions and it is recommended that the <samp><span class="option">-fexceptions</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span></samp> options are used when linking.

     <li>With the NeXT runtime, although currently designed to be binary
compatible with <code>NS_HANDLER</code>-style idioms provided by the
<code>NSException</code> class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac
OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later systems, due to additional functionality
needed in the NeXT Objective-C runtime.

     <li>As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C++
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <code>@throw</code> an exception
from Objective-C and <code>catch</code> it in C++, or vice versa
(i.e., <code>throw ... @catch</code>). 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">8.8 Synchronization</h3>

<p>GNU Objective-C provides support for synchronized blocks:

<pre class="smallexample">       @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
         ...
       }
</pre>
 <p>Upon entering the <code>@synchronized</code> block, a thread of execution
shall first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding
<code>guard</code> object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread
shall wait until the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once
<code>guard</code> becomes available, the current thread will place its own
lock on it, execute the code contained in the <code>@synchronized</code>
block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby making <code>guard</code>
available to other threads).

 <p>Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be
marked <code>@synchronized</code>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<code>@synchronized</code> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding
object to be unlocked properly.

 <p>Because of the interactions between synchronization and exception
handling, you can only use <code>@synchronized</code> when compiling with
exceptions enabled, that is with the command line option
<samp><span class="option">-fobjc-exceptions</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">8.9.1 Using Fast Enumeration</h4>

<p>GNU Objective-C provides support for the fast enumeration syntax:

<pre class="smallexample">       id array = ...;
       id object;
     
       for (object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object' */
       }
</pre>
 <p><code>array</code> needs to be an Objective-C object (usually a collection
object, for example an array, a dictionary or a set) which implements
the &ldquo;Fast Enumeration Protocol&rdquo; (see below).  If you are using a
Foundation library such as GNUstep Base or Apple Cocoa Foundation, all
collection objects in the library implement this protocol and can be
used in this way.

 <p>The code above would iterate over all objects in <code>array</code>.  For
each of them, it assigns it to <code>object</code>, then executes the
<code>Do something with 'object'</code> statements.

 <p>Here is a fully worked-out example using a Foundation library (which
provides the implementation of <code>NSArray</code>, <code>NSString</code> and
<code>NSLog</code>):

<pre class="smallexample">       NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"1", @"2", @"3", nil];
       NSString *object;
     
       for (object in array)
         NSLog (@"Iterating over %@", object);
</pre>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.9.2 C99-Like Fast Enumeration Syntax</h4>

<p>A c99-like declaration syntax is also allowed:

<pre class="smallexample">       id array = ...;
     
       for (id object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object'  */
       }
</pre>
 <p>this is completely equivalent to:

<pre class="smallexample">       id array = ...;
     
       {
         id object;
         for (object in array)
         {
           /* Do something with 'object'  */
         }
       }
</pre>
 <p>but can save some typing.

 <p>Note that the option <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> is not required to allow this
syntax in Objective-C.

<h4 class="subsection">8.9.3 Fast Enumeration Details</h4>

<p>Here is a more technical description with the gory details.  Consider the code

<pre class="smallexample">       for (<var>object expression</var> in <var>collection expression</var>)
       {
         <var>statements</var>
       }
</pre>
 <p>here is what happens when you run it:

     <ul>
<li><var>collection expression</var> is evaluated exactly once and the
result is used as the collection object to iterate over.  This means
it is safe to write code such as <code>for (object in [NSDictionary
keyEnumerator]) ...</code>.

     <li>the iteration is implemented by the compiler by repeatedly getting
batches of objects from the collection object using the fast
enumeration protocol (see below), then iterating over all objects in
the batch.  This is faster than a normal enumeration where objects are
retrieved one by one (hence the name &ldquo;fast enumeration&rdquo;).

     <li>if there are no objects in the collection, then
<var>object expression</var> is set to <code>nil</code> and the loop
immediately terminates.

     <li>if there are objects in the collection, then for each object in the
collection (in the order they are returned) <var>object expression</var>
is set to the object, then <var>statements</var> are executed.

     <li><var>statements</var> can contain <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>
commands, which will abort the iteration or skip to the next loop
iteration as expected.

     <li>when the iteration ends because there are no more objects to iterate
over, <var>object expression</var> is set to <code>nil</code>.  This allows
you to determine whether the iteration finished because a <code>break</code>
command was used (in which case <var>object expression</var> will remain
set to the last object that was iterated over) or because it iterated
over all the objects (in which case <var>object expression</var> will be
set to <code>nil</code>).

     <li><var>statements</var> must not make any changes to the collection
object; if they do, it is a hard error and the fast enumeration
terminates by invoking <code>objc_enumerationMutation</code>, a runtime
function that normally aborts the program but which can be customized
by Foundation libraries via <code>objc_set_mutation_handler</code> to do
something different, such as raising an exception.

 </ul>

<h4 class="subsection">8.9.4 Fast Enumeration Protocol</h4>

<p>If you want your own collection object to be usable with fast
enumeration, you need to have it implement the method

<pre class="smallexample">     - (unsigned long) countByEnumeratingWithState: (NSFastEnumerationState *)state
                                           objects: (id *)objects
                                             count: (unsigned long)len;
</pre>
 <p>where <code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> must be defined in your code as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef struct
     {
       unsigned long state;
       id            *itemsPtr;
       unsigned long *mutationsPtr;
       unsigned long extra[5];
     } NSFastEnumerationState;
</pre>
 <p>If no <code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> is defined in your code, the
compiler will automatically replace <code>NSFastEnumerationState *</code>
with <code>struct __objcFastEnumerationState *</code>, where that type is
silently defined by the compiler in an identical way.  This can be
confusing and we recommend that you define
<code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> (as shown above) instead.

 <p>The method is called repeatedly during a fast enumeration to retrieve
batches of objects.  Each invocation of the method should retrieve the
next batch of objects.

 <p>The return value of the method is the number of objects in the current
batch; this should not exceed <code>len</code>, which is the maximum size of
a batch as requested by the caller.  The batch itself is returned in
the <code>itemsPtr</code> field of the <code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> struct.

 <p>To help with returning the objects, the <code>objects</code> array is a C
array preallocated by the caller (on the stack) of size <code>len</code>. 
In many cases you can put the objects you want to return in that
<code>objects</code> array, then do <code>itemsPtr = objects</code>.  But you
don't have to; if your collection already has the objects to return in
some form of C array, it could return them from there instead.

 <p>The <code>state</code> and <code>extra</code> fields of the
<code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> structure allows your collection object
to keep track of the state of the enumeration.  In a simple array
implementation, <code>state</code> may keep track of the index of the last
object that was returned, and <code>extra</code> may be unused.

 <p>The <code>mutationsPtr</code> field of the <code>NSFastEnumerationState</code> is
used to keep track of mutations.  It should point to a number; before
working on each object, the fast enumeration loop will check that this
number has not changed.  If it has, a mutation has happened and the
fast enumeration will abort.  So, <code>mutationsPtr</code> could be set to
point to some sort of version number of your collection, which is
increased by one every time there is a change (for example when an
object is added or removed).  Or, if you are content with less strict
mutation checks, it could point to the number of objects in your
collection or some other value that can be checked to perform an
approximate check that the collection has not been mutated.

 <p>Finally, note how we declared the <code>len</code> argument and the return
value to be of type <code>unsigned long</code>.  They could also be declared
to be of type <code>unsigned int</code> and everything would still work.

<h3 class="section">8.10 Messaging with the GNU Objective-C Runtime</h3>

<p>This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 <p>The implementation of messaging in the GNU Objective-C runtime is
designed to be portable, and so is based on standard C.

 <p>Sending a message in the GNU Objective-C runtime is composed of two
separate steps.  First, there is a call to the lookup function,
<code>objc_msg_lookup ()</code> (or, in the case of messages to super,
<code>objc_msg_lookup_super ()</code>).  This runtime function takes as
argument the receiver and the selector of the method to be called; it
returns the <code>IMP</code>, that is a pointer to the function implementing
the method.  The second step of method invocation consists of casting
this pointer function to the appropriate function pointer type, and
calling the function pointed to it with the right arguments.

 <p>For example, when the compiler encounters a method invocation such as
<code>[object init]</code>, it compiles it into a call to
<code>objc_msg_lookup (object, @selector(init))</code> followed by a cast
of the returned value to the appropriate function pointer type, and
then it calls it.

method, it tries to see if the class can dynamically register the
method.

 <p>To do so, the runtime checks if the class of the receiver implements
the method

<pre class="smallexample">     + (BOOL) resolveInstanceMethod: (SEL)selector;
</pre>
 <p>in the case of an instance method, or

<pre class="smallexample">     + (BOOL) resolveClassMethod: (SEL)selector;
</pre>
 <p>in the case of a class method.  If the class implements it, the
runtime invokes it, passing as argument the selector of the original
method, and if it returns <code>YES</code>, the runtime tries the lookup
again, which could now succeed if a matching method was added
dynamically by <code>+resolveInstanceMethod:</code> or
<code>+resolveClassMethod:</code>.

 <p>This allows classes to dynamically register methods (by adding them to
the class using <code>class_addMethod</code>) when they are first called. 
To do so, a class should implement <code>+resolveInstanceMethod:</code> (or,
depending on the case, <code>+resolveClassMethod:</code>) and have it
recognize the selectors of methods that can be registered dynamically
at runtime, register them, and return <code>YES</code>.  It should return
<code>NO</code> for methods that it does not dynamically registered at
runtime.

 <p>If <code>+resolveInstanceMethod:</code> (or <code>+resolveClassMethod:</code>) is
not implemented or returns <code>NO</code>, the runtime then tries the
forwarding hook.

 <p>Support for <code>+resolveInstanceMethod:</code> and
<code>resolveClassMethod:</code> was added to the GNU Objective-C runtime in
GCC version 4.6.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.10.2 Forwarding Hook</h4>

<p>The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a hook, called
<code>__objc_msg_forward2</code>, which is called by
<code>objc_msg_lookup()</code> when it cannot find a method implementation in
the runtime tables and after calling <code>+resolveInstanceMethod:</code>
and <code>+resolveClassMethod:</code> has been attempted and did not succeed
in dynamically registering the method.

 <p>To configure the hook, you set the global variable
<code>__objc_msg_forward2</code> to a function with the same argument and
return types of <code>objc_msg_lookup()</code>.  When
<code>objc_msg_lookup()</code> can not find a method implementation, it
invokes the hook function you provided to get a method implementation
to return.  So, in practice <code>__objc_msg_forward2</code> allows you to
extend <code>objc_msg_lookup()</code> by adding some custom code that is
called to do a further lookup when no standard method implementation
can be found using the normal lookup.

 <p>This hook is generally reserved for &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo; libraries such as
GNUstep Base, which use it to implement their high-level method
forwarding API, typically based around the <code>forwardInvocation:</code>
method.  So, unless you are implementing your own &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo;
library, you should not set this hook.

 <p>In a typical forwarding implementation, the <code>__objc_msg_forward2</code>
hook function determines the argument and return type of the method
that is being looked up, and then creates a function that takes these
arguments and has that return type, and returns it to the caller. 
Creating this function is non-trivial and is typically performed using
a dedicated library such as <code>libffi</code>.

 <p>The forwarding method implementation thus created is returned by
<code>objc_msg_lookup()</code> and is executed as if it was a normal method
implementation.  When the forwarding method implementation is called,
it is usually expected to pack all arguments into some sort of object
(typically, an <code>NSInvocation</code> in a &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo; library), and
hand it over to the programmer (<code>forwardInvocation:</code>) who is then
allowed to manipulate the method invocation using a high-level API
provided by the &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo; library.  For example, the programmer
may want to examine the method invocation arguments and name and
potentially change them before forwarding the method invocation to one
or more local objects (<code>performInvocation:</code>) or even to remote
objects (by using Distributed Objects or some other mechanism).  When
all this completes, the return value is passed back and must be
returned correctly to the original caller.

 <p>Note that the GNU Objective-C runtime currently provides no support
for method forwarding or method invocations other than the
<code>__objc_msg_forward2</code> hook.

 <p>If the forwarding hook does not exist or returns <code>NULL</code>, the
runtime currently attempts forwarding using an older, deprecated API,
and if that fails, it aborts the program.  In future versions of the
GNU Objective-C runtime, the runtime will immediately abort.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Binary Compatibility</h2>

<p><a name="index-binary-compatibility-4824"></a><a name="index-ABI-4825"></a><a name="index-application-binary-interface-4826"></a>
Binary compatibility encompasses several related concepts:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>application binary interface (ABI)</dfn><dd>The set of runtime conventions followed by all of the tools that deal
with binary representations of a program, including compilers, assemblers,
linkers, and language runtime support. 
Some ABIs are formal with a written specification, possibly designed
by multiple interested parties.  Others are simply the way things are
actually done by a particular set of tools.

     <br><dt><dfn>ABI conformance</dfn><dd>A compiler conforms to an ABI if it generates code that follows all of
the specifications enumerated by that ABI. 
A library conforms to an ABI if it is implemented according to that ABI. 
An application conforms to an ABI if it is built using tools that conform
to that ABI and does not contain source code that specifically changes
behavior specified by the ABI.

     <br><dt><dfn>calling conventions</dfn><dd>Calling conventions are a subset of an ABI that specify of how arguments
are passed and function results are returned.

     <br><dt><dfn>interoperability</dfn><dd>Different sets of tools are interoperable if they generate files that
can be used in the same program.  The set of tools includes compilers,
assemblers, linkers, libraries, header files, startup files, and debuggers. 
Binaries produced by different sets of tools are not interoperable unless
they implement the same ABI.  This applies to different versions of the
same tools as well as tools from different vendors.

     <br><dt><dfn>intercallability</dfn><dd>Whether a function in a binary built by one set of tools can call a
function in a binary built by a different set of tools is a subset
of interoperability.

     <br><dt><dfn>implementation-defined features</dfn><dd>Language standards include lists of implementation-defined features whose
behavior can vary from one implementation to another.  Some of these
features are normally covered by a platform's ABI and others are not. 
The features that are not covered by an ABI generally affect how a
program behaves, but not intercallability.

     <br><dt><dfn>compatibility</dfn><dd>Conformance to the same ABI and the same behavior of implementation-defined
features are both relevant for compatibility. 
</dl>

 <p>The application binary interface implemented by a C or C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:

     <ul>
<li>size and alignment of data types
<li>layout of structured types
<li>calling conventions
<li>register usage conventions
<li>interfaces for runtime arithmetic support
<li>object file formats
</ul>

 <p>In addition, the application binary interface implemented by a C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:
     <ul>
<li>name mangling
<li>exception handling
<li>invoking constructors and destructors
<li>layout, alignment, and padding of classes
<li>layout and alignment of virtual tables
</ul>

 <p>Some GCC compilation options cause the compiler to generate code that
does not conform to the platform's default ABI.  Other options cause
different program behavior for implementation-defined features that are
not covered by an ABI.  These options are provided for consistency with
other compilers that do not follow the platform's default ABI or the
usual behavior of implementation-defined features for the platform. 
Be very careful about using such options.

 <p>Most platforms have a well-defined ABI that covers C code, but ABIs
that cover C++ functionality are not yet common.

 <p>Starting with GCC 3.2, GCC binary conventions for C++ are based on a
written, vendor-neutral C++ ABI that was designed to be specific to
64-bit Itanium but also includes generic specifications that apply to
any platform. 
This C++ ABI is also implemented by other compiler vendors on some
platforms, notably GNU/Linux and BSD systems. 
We have tried hard to provide a stable ABI that will be compatible with
future GCC releases, but it is possible that we will encounter problems
that make this difficult.  Such problems could include different
interpretations of the C++ ABI by different vendors, bugs in the ABI, or
bugs in the implementation of the ABI in different compilers. 
GCC's <samp><span class="option">-Wabi</span></samp> switch warns when G++ generates code that is
probably not compatible with the C++ ABI.

 <p>The C++ library used with a C++ compiler includes the Standard C++
Library, with functionality defined in the C++ Standard, plus language
runtime support.  The runtime support is included in a C++ ABI, but there
is no formal ABI for the Standard C++ Library.  Two implementations
of that library are interoperable if one follows the de-facto ABI of the
other and if they are both built with the same compiler, or with compilers
that conform to the same ABI for C++ compiler and runtime support.

 <p>When G++ and another C++ compiler conform to the same C++ ABI, but the
implementations of the Standard C++ Library that they normally use do not
follow the same ABI for the Standard C++ Library, object files built with
those compilers can be used in the same program only if they use the same
C++ library.  This requires specifying the location of the C++ library
header files when invoking the compiler whose usual library is not being
used.  The location of GCC's C++ header files depends on how the GCC
build was configured, but can be seen by using the G++ <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> option. 
With default configuration options for G++ 3.3 the compile line for a
different C++ compiler needs to include

<pre class="smallexample">         -I<var>gcc_install_directory</var>/include/c++/3.3
</pre>
 <p>Similarly, compiling code with G++ that must use a C++ library other
than the GNU C++ library requires specifying the location of the header
files for that other library.

 <p>The most straightforward way to link a program to use a particular
C++ library is to use a C++ driver that specifies that C++ library by
default.  The <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> driver, for example, tells the linker where
to find GCC's C++ library (<samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp>) plus the other libraries
and startup files it needs, in the proper order.

 <p>If a program must use a different C++ library and it's not possible
to do the final link using a C++ driver that uses that library by default,
it is necessary to tell <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> the location and name of that
library.  It might also be necessary to specify different startup files
and other runtime support libraries, and to suppress the use of GCC's
support libraries with one or more of the options <samp><span class="option">-nostdlib</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-nostartfiles</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">10.1 Introduction to <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp></h3>

<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
<p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC
to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running
code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> as a profiling tool to help discover where your
optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> along with the other profiling tool, <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp>, to
assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing
time.

 <p>Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp>, you can find out some
basic performance statistics, such as:

     <ul>
<li>how often each line of code executes

     <li>what lines of code are actually executed

     <li>how much computing time each section of code uses
</ul>

 <p>Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized. 
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> helps you determine where to work on optimization.

 <p>Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release. 
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.

 <p>You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to
look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer
time.  Likewise, because <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> accumulates statistics by line (at
the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming style that
places only one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros
that expand to loops or to other control structures, the statistics are
less helpful&mdash;they only report on the line where the macro call
appears.  If your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace
them with inline functions to solve this problem.

 <p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> creates a logfile called <samp><var>sourcefile</var><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> which
indicates how many times each line of a source file <samp><var>sourcefile</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp>
has executed.  You can use these logfiles along with <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp> to aid
in fine-tuning the performance of your programs.  <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp> gives
timing information you can use along with the information you get from
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>.

 <p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not
compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a</code><dt><code>--all-blocks</code><dd>Write individual execution counts for every basic block.  Normally gcov
outputs execution counts only for the main blocks of a line.  With this
option you can determine if blocks within a single line are not being
executed.

     <br><dt><code>-b</code><dt><code>--branch-probabilities</code><dd>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
each branch in your program was taken.  Unconditional branches will not
be shown, unless the <samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> option is given.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dt><code>--branch-counts</code><dd>Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather than
the percentage of branches taken.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><dt><code>--display-progress</code><dd>Display the progress on the standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-f</code><dt><code>--function-summaries</code><dd>Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Display help about using <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> (on the standard output), and

be used by <samp><span class="command">lcov</span></samp> or other tools. The output is a single
<samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> file per <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file. No source code is required.

     <p>The format of the intermediate <samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> file is plain text with

     <p>There can be multiple <var>file</var> entries in an intermediate gcov

Use colors for lines of code that have zero coverage.  We use red color for
non-exceptional lines and cyan for exceptional.  Same colors are used for
basic blocks with <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dt><code>--long-file-names</code><dd>Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
header file <samp><span class="file">x.h</span></samp> contains code, and was included in the file
<samp><span class="file">a.c</span></samp>, then running <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> on the file <samp><span class="file">a.c</span></samp> will
produce an output file called <samp><span class="file">a.c##x.h.gcov</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="file">x.h.gcov</span></samp>.  This can be useful if <samp><span class="file">x.h</span></samp> is included in
multiple source files and you want to see the individual
contributions.  If you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; option, both the including
and included file names will be complete path names.

     <br><dt><code>-m</code><dt><code>--demangled-names</code><dd>Display demangled function names in output. The default is to show
mangled function names.

     <br><dt><code>-n</code><dt><code>--no-output</code><dd>Do not create the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> output file.

     <br><dt><code>-o </code><var>directory|file</var><dt><code>--object-directory </code><var>directory</var><dt><code>--object-file </code><var>file</var><dd>Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
object path name.  The <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> data files are searched for using this option.  If a directory
is specified, the data files are in that directory and named after the
input file name, without its extension.  If a file is specified here,
the data files are named after that file, without its extension.

     <br><dt><code>-p</code><dt><code>--preserve-paths</code><dd>Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
<samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> files.  Without this option, just the filename component is
used.  With this option, all directories are used, with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; characters
translated to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> directory components
removed and unremoveable <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>
components renamed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is useful if sourcefiles are in several
different directories.

     <br><dt><code>-r</code><dt><code>--relative-only</code><dd>Only output information about source files with a relative pathname
(after source prefix elision).  Absolute paths are usually system
header files and coverage of any inline functions therein is normally
uninteresting.

     <br><dt><code>-s </code><var>directory</var><dt><code>--source-prefix </code><var>directory</var><dd>A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
coverage files.  This option is useful when building in a separate
directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted when
determining the output file names.  Note that this prefix detection is
applied before determining whether the source file is absolute.

     <br><dt><code>-u</code><dt><code>--unconditional-branches</code><dd>When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional branches. 
Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dt><code>--version</code><dd>Display the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> version number (on the standard output),
and exit without doing any further processing.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dt><code>--verbose</code><dd>Print verbose informations related to basic blocks and arcs.

     <br><dt><code>-x</code><dt><code>--hash-filenames</code><dd>By default, gcov uses the full pathname of the source files to create
an output filename.  This can lead to long filenames that can overflow
filesystem limits.  This option creates names of the form
<samp><var>source-file</var><span class="file">##</span><var>md5</var><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp>,
where the <var>source-file</var> component is the final filename part and
the <var>md5</var> component is calculated from the full mangled name that

 <p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files.  <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> produces files called
<samp><var>mangledname</var><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> in the current directory.  These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to. 
One <samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> file is produced for each source (or header) file
containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files.  The <var>mangledname</var> part
of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
be something more complicated if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; options are
given.  Refer to those options for details.

 <p>If you invoke <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> with multiple input files, the
contributions from each input file are summed.  Typically you would
invoke it with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.

 <p>The <samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> files contain the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; separated fields along with
program source code.  The format is

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>execution_count</var>:<var>line_number</var>:<var>source line text</var>
</pre>
 <p>Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The <var>execution_count</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; for lines
containing no code.  Unexecuted lines are marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#####</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=====</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on whether they are reachable by
non-exceptional paths or only exceptional paths such as C++ exception
handlers, respectively. Given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; option, unexecuted blocks are
marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$$$$</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%%%%</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on whether a basic block
is reachable via non-exceptional or exceptional paths. 
Executed basic blocks having a statement with zero <var>execution_count</var>
end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; character and are colored with magenta color with <samp><span class="option">-k</span></samp>
option.  The functionality is not supported in Ada.

 <p>Note that GCC can completely remove the bodies of functions that are
not needed &ndash; for instance if they are inlined everywhere.  Such functions
are marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can be confusing. 
Use the <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-static-functions</span></samp>
options to retain these functions and
allow gcov to properly show their <var>execution_count</var>.

 <p>Some lines of information at the start have <var>line_number</var> of zero. 
These preamble lines are of the form

<pre class="smallexample">     -:0:<var>tag</var>:<var>value</var>
</pre>
 <p>The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> development progresses &mdash; do not rely on them remaining
unchanged.  Use <var>tag</var> to locate a particular preamble line.

 <p>The additional block information is of the form

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>tag</var> <var>information</var>
</pre>
 <p>The <var>information</var> is human readable, but designed to be simple
enough for machine parsing too.

 <p>When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are <em>exactly</em> 0% and 100% respectively.  Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.

 <p>When using <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>, you must first compile your program with two
special GCC options: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.

 <p>Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, an accompanying
<samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file will be placed in the object file directory.

 <p>Running <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called <samp><span class="file">tmp.cpp</span></samp>, this
is what you see when you use the basic <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> facility:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ g++ -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.cpp
     $ a.out
     $ gcov tmp.cpp -m
     File 'tmp.cpp'
     Lines executed:92.86% of 14
     Creating 'tmp.cpp.gcov'
</pre>
 <p>The file <samp><span class="file">tmp.cpp.gcov</span></samp> contains output from <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>. 
Here is a sample:

<pre class="smallexample">             -:    0:Source:tmp.cpp

 <p>Note that line 7 is shown in the report multiple times.  First occurrence
presents total number of execution of the line and the next two belong
to instances of class Foo constructors.  As you can also see, line 30 contains
some unexecuted basic blocks and thus execution count has asterisk symbol.

 <p>When you use the <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option, you will get individual block

 <p>In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line &ndash; the last
line of the block.  A multi-line block will only contribute to the
execution count of that last line, and other lines will not be shown
to contain code, unless previous blocks end on those lines. 
The total execution count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show
the execution counts for individual blocks that end on that line.  After each
block, the branch and call counts of the block will be shown, if the
<samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> option is given.

 <p>Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can be shown
after a line with no individual blocks. 
As you can see, line 33 contains a basic block that was not executed.

 <p>When you use the <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> option, your output looks like this:

</pre>
 <p>For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the function
is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.

 <p>For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.

 <p>For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message &ldquo;never executed&rdquo; is printed.

 <p>For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call <code>exit</code> or <code>longjmp</code>,
and thus may not return every time they are called.

 <p>The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

 <p>The data in the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Precise Decision Coverage</h3>

<p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> can genuinely perform decision coverage by using option
<samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> (i.e. showing that each branch was taken).  But you can even
go further, showing that each individual subcondition is covered and can
modify the global decision.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     int is_cond (int a, int b, int c)
     {
       return (a &gt;= 0) || (b == 0 &amp;&amp; c != 0);
     }
</pre>
 <p>You have to write testcases (the minimum is 4 here) to show that each
argument can make the function return 0.

 <p>In principle, you can achieve this result with <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> by using a
particular coding style: always use short-circuit boolean operators. 
This is a very natural coding style in C as the boolean operators
<code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> are short-circuit operators.

 <p>A consequence of the short-circuit operator is that a decision is made
for each individual subcondition.  With a properly written test harness,
the result of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcov -b -c</span></samp>&rsquo; on the previous example can be:

<pre class="smallexample">             -:    1:int is_cond (int a, int b, int c)
     function is_cond called 4 returned 100% blocks executed 100%
             4:    2:{
             4:    3:  return (a &gt;= 0) || (b == 0 &amp;&amp; c != 0);

 <p>There are 3 decisions and thus 6 branches (1 for the true path and one for
the false path).  And with the 4 tests all the branches are taken.

 <p>By default, the GCC optimizers may defeat this approach by performing
transformations that break the low-level control flow representativity
of the source-level control flow.  <samp><span class="option">-fpreserve-control-flow</span></samp> can
be passed on the command line to disable these transformations.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Using <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> with GCC Optimization</h3>

<p>If you plan to use <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to help optimize your code, you must
first compile your program with two special GCC options:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Aside from that, you can use any
other GCC options; but if you want to prove that every single line
in your program was executed, you should not compile with optimization
at the same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some
simple code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     if (a != b)
       c = 1;
     else
       c = 0;
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to calculate separate execution counts
for each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence
the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:

<pre class="smallexample">           100:   12:if (a != b)
           100:   13:  c = 1;
           100:   14:else
           100:   15:  c = 0;
</pre>
 <p>The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.

 <p>Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts.  Line counts are
shown for the source code of the inlineable function, but what is shown
depends on where the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined at all.

 <p>If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an out of line
copy of the function, in any object file that needs it.  If
<samp><span class="file">fileA.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">fileB.o</span></samp> both contain out of line bodies of a
particular inlineable function, they will also both contain coverage
counts for that function.  When <samp><span class="file">fileA.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">fileB.o</span></samp> are
linked together, the linker will, on many systems, select one of those
out of line bodies for all calls to that function, and remove or ignore
the other.  Unfortunately, it will not remove the coverage counters for
the unused function body.  Hence when instrumented, all but one use of
that function will show zero counts.

 <p>If the function is inlined in several places, the block structure in
each location might not be the same.  For instance, a condition might
now be calculable at compile time in some instances.  Because the
coverage of all the uses of the inline function will be shown for the
same source lines, the line counts themselves might seem inconsistent.

 <p>Long-running applications can use the <code>__gcov_reset</code> and <code>__gcov_dump</code>
facilities to restrict profile collection to the program region of
interest. Calling <code>__gcov_reset(void)</code> will clear all profile counters
to zero, and calling <code>__gcov_dump(void)</code> will cause the profile information
collected at that point to be dumped to <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> output files. 
Instrumented applications use a static destructor with priority 99
to invoke the <code>__gcov_dump</code> function. Thus <code>__gcov_dump</code>
is executed after all user defined static destructors,
as well as handlers registered with <code>atexit</code>. 
If an executable loads a dynamic shared object via dlopen functionality,
<samp><span class="option">-Wl,--dynamic-list-data</span></samp> is needed to dump all profile data.

<h3 class="section">10.5 Brief Description of <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> Data Files</h3>

<p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> uses two files for profiling.  The names of these files
are derived from the original <em>object</em> file by substituting the
file suffix with either <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp>.  The files
contain coverage and profile data stored in a platform-independent format. 
The <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> files are placed in the same directory as the object
file.  By default, the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files are also stored in the same
directory as the object file, but the GCC <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-dir</span></samp> option
may be used to store the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files in a separate directory.

 <p>The <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> notes file is generated when the source file is compiled
with the GCC <samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp> option.  It contains information to
reconstruct the basic block graphs and assign source line numbers to
blocks.

 <p>The <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> count data file is generated when a program containing
object files built with the GCC <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> option is executed. 
A separate <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file is created for each object file compiled with
this option.  It contains arc transition counts, value profile counts, and
some summary information.

 <p>It is not recommended to access the coverage files directly. 
Consumers should use the intermediate format that is provided
by <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> tool via <samp><span class="option">--intermediate-format</span></samp> option.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Data File Relocation to Support Cross-Profiling</h3>

<p>Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, an accompanying <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp>
file will be placed in the object file directory. That implicitly requires
running the program on the same system as it was built or having the same
absolute directory structure on the target system. The program will try
to create the needed directory structure, if it is not already present.

 <p>To support cross-profiling, a program compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
can relocate the data files based on two environment variables:

     <ul>
<li>GCOV_PREFIX contains the prefix to add to the absolute paths
in the object file. Prefix can be absolute, or relative.  The
default is no prefix.

     <li>GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP indicates the how many initial directory names to strip off
the hardwired absolute paths. Default value is 0.

     <p><em>Note:</em> If GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP is set without GCOV_PREFIX is undefined,
 then a relative path is made out of the hardwired absolute paths. 
</ul>

 <p>For example, if the object file <samp><span class="file">/user/build/foo.o</span></samp> was built with
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, the final executable will try to create the data file
<samp><span class="file">/user/build/foo.gcda</span></samp> when running on the target system.  This will
fail if the corresponding directory does not exist and it is unable to create
it.  This can be overcome by, for example, setting the environment as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GCOV_PREFIX=/target/run</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Such a
setting will name the data file <samp><span class="file">/target/run/build/foo.gcda</span></samp>.

 <p>You must move the data files to the expected directory tree in order to
use them for profile directed optimizations (<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>), or to
use the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> tool.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Introduction to <samp><span class="command">gcov-tool</span></samp></h3>

<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
<p><samp><span class="command">gcov-tool</span></samp> is an offline tool to process gcc's gcda profile files.

 <p>Current gcov-tool supports the following functionalities:

     <ul>
<li>merge two sets of profiles with weights.

     <li>read one set of profile and rewrite profile contents. One can scale or
normalize the count values. 
</ul>

 <p>Examples of the use cases for this tool are:
     <ul>
<li>Collect the profiles for different set of inputs, and use this tool to merge
them. One can specify the weight to factor in the relative importance of
each input.

     <li>Rewrite the profile after removing a subset of the gcda files, while maintaining
the consistency of the summary and the histogram.

     <li>It can also be used to debug or libgcov code as the tools shares the majority
code as the runtime library. 
</ul>

 <p>Note that for the merging operation, this profile generated offline may
contain slight different values from the online merged profile. Here are
a list of typical differences:

     <ul>
<li>histogram difference: This offline tool recomputes the histogram after merging
the counters. The resulting histogram, therefore, is precise. The online
merging does not have this capability &ndash; the histogram is merged from two
histograms and the result is an approximation.

     <li>summary checksum difference: Summary checksum uses a CRC32 operation. The value
depends on the link list order of gcov-info objects. This order is different in
gcov-tool from that in the online merge. It's expected to have different
summary checksums. It does not really matter as the compiler does not use this
checksum anywhere.

     <li>value profile counter values difference: Some counter values for value profile
are runtime dependent, like heap addresses. It's normal to see some difference
in these kind of counters. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">13.2 Interoperation</h3>

<p>This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GCC
together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.

     <ul>
<li>On many platforms, GCC supports a different ABI for C++ than do other
compilers, so the object files compiled by GCC cannot be used with object
files generated by another C++ compiler.

     <p>An area where the difference is most apparent is name mangling.  The use
of different name mangling is intentional, to protect you from more subtle
problems. 
Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++ implementation,
including: how class instances are laid out, how multiple inheritance is
implemented, and how virtual function calls are handled.  If the name
encoding were made the same, your programs would link against libraries
provided from other compilers&mdash;but the programs would then crash when
run.  Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
at run time.

     <li>On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of profiling
causes static variable destructors (currently used only in C++) not to
be run.

     <li>On a SPARC, GCC aligns all values of type <code>double</code> on an 8-byte
boundary, and it expects every <code>double</code> to be so aligned.  The Sun
compiler usually gives <code>double</code> values 8-byte alignment, with one
exception: function arguments of type <code>double</code> may not be aligned.

     <p>As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address of an
argument of type <code>double</code> and passes this pointer of type
<code>double *</code> to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
pointer may cause a fatal signal.

     <p>One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program with GCC. 
Another solution is to modify the function that is compiled with
Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable; local variables
are always properly aligned.  A third solution is to modify the function
that uses the pointer to dereference it via the following function
<code>access_double</code> instead of directly with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;:

     <pre class="smallexample">          inline double
          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
          {
            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };
          
            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
            union d2i u;
          
            u.i[0] = p-&gt;i[0];
            u.i[1] = p-&gt;i[1];
          
            return u.d;
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

     <li>On Solaris, the <code>malloc</code> function in the <samp><span class="file">libmalloc.a</span></samp> library
may allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
SPARC assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
<samp><span class="file">libmalloc.a</span></samp> library.

     <p>The solution is to not use the <samp><span class="file">libmalloc.a</span></samp> library.  Use instead
<code>malloc</code> and related functions from <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp>; they do not have
this problem.

     <li>On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions compiled
with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions that use
<code>alloca</code> or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC doesn't
generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It may even be
impossible to generate them.

     <li>Debugging (<samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>) is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you use
the preliminary GNU tools.

     <li>Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

     <li>Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static functions
will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply is no way for GCC
to specify what registers hold arguments for static functions when using
the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

     <li>In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of bounds
unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often in previous
versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you should run
into it, you can work around by making your function smaller.

     <li>GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler of
the form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (warning) Use of GR3 when
            frame &gt;= 8192 may cause conflict.
</pre>
     <p>These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

     <li>In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the AIX Assembler complaining about a displacement
that is too large.  If you should run into it, you can work around by
making your function smaller.

     <li>The <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> library in GCC relies on the SVR4 dynamic
linker semantics which merges global symbols between libraries and
applications, especially necessary for C++ streams functionality. 
This is not the default behavior of AIX shared libraries and dynamic
linking.  <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> is built on AIX with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo;
enabled so that symbol merging can occur.  To utilize this feature,
the application linked with <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> must include the
<samp><span class="option">-Wl,-brtl</span></samp> flag on the link line.  G++ cannot impose this
because this option may interfere with the semantics of the user
program and users may not always use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g++</span></samp>&rsquo; to link his or her
application.  Applications are not required to use the
<samp><span class="option">-Wl,-brtl</span></samp> flag on the link line&mdash;the rest of the
<samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> library which is not dependent on the symbol
merging semantics will continue to function correctly.

     <li>An application can interpose its own definition of functions for
functions invoked by <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp> with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo;
enabled on AIX.  To accomplish this the application must be linked
with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo; option and the functions explicitly must be
exported by the application (<samp><span class="option">-Wl,-brtl,-bE:exportfile</span></samp>).

     <li>AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; vs &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; for separating decimal
fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library linked
with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the
assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
environment variable to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">En_US</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li><a name="index-fdollars_002din_002didentifiers-4830"></a>Even if you specify <samp><span class="option">-fdollars-in-identifiers</span></samp>,
you cannot successfully use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; in identifiers on the RS/6000 due
to a restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these
identifiers.

<h3 class="section">13.3 Incompatibilities of GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-incompatibilities-of-GCC-4831"></a><a name="index-traditional-4832"></a>
There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and K&amp;R
(non-ISO) versions of C.

     
<a name="index-string-constants-4833"></a>
<a name="index-read_002donly-strings-4834"></a>
<a name="index-shared-strings-4835"></a>
<ul><li>GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
copy of the string.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmktemp_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-4836"></a>One consequence is that you cannot call <code>mktemp</code> with a string
constant argument.  The function <code>mktemp</code> always alters the
string its argument points to.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-4837"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-4838"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-4839"></a>Another consequence is that <code>sscanf</code> does not work on some very
old systems when passed a string constant as its format control string
or input.  This is because <code>sscanf</code> incorrectly tries to write
into the string constant.  Likewise <code>fscanf</code> and <code>scanf</code>.

     <p>The solution to these problems is to change the program to use
<code>char</code>-array variables with initialization strings for these
purposes instead of string constants.

     <li><code>-2147483648</code> is positive.

     <p>This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type <code>int</code>, so
(following the ISO C rules) its data type is <code>unsigned long int</code>. 
Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

     <li>GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define foo(a) "a"
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">will produce output <code>"a"</code> regardless of what the argument <var>a</var> is.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsetjmp_007d-incompatibilities-4840"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-incompatibilities-4841"></a><li>When you use <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>, the only automatic
variables guaranteed to remain valid are those declared
<code>volatile</code>.  This is a consequence of automatic register
allocation.  Consider this function:

     <pre class="smallexample">          jmp_buf j;
          
          foo ()
          {
            int a, b;
          
            a = fun1 ();
            if (setjmp (j))
              return a;
          
            a = fun2 ();
            /* <code>longjmp (j)</code><span class="roman"> may occur in </span><code>fun3</code><span class="roman">.</span> */
            return a + fun3 ();
          }
</pre>
     <p>Here <code>a</code> may or may not be restored to its first value when the
<code>longjmp</code> occurs.  If <code>a</code> is allocated in a register, then
its first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
in it.

     <p><a name="index-W-4842"></a>If you use the <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp> option with the <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option, you will
get a warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.

     <li>Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
will not work:

     <pre class="smallexample">          foobar (
          #define luser
                  hack)
</pre>
     <p>ISO C does not permit such a construct.

     <li>K&amp;R compilers allow comments to cross over an inclusion boundary
(i.e. started in an include file and ended in the including file).

     <p><a name="index-external-declaration-scope-4843"></a><a name="index-scope-of-external-declarations-4844"></a><a name="index-declaration-scope-4845"></a><li>Declarations of external variables and functions within a block apply
only to the block containing the declaration.  In other words, they
have the same scope as any other declaration in the same place.

     <p>In some other C compilers, an <code>extern</code> declaration affects all the
rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

     <li>In traditional C, you can combine <code>long</code>, etc., with a typedef name,
as shown here:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int foo;
          typedef long foo bar;
</pre>
     <p>In ISO C, this is not allowed: <code>long</code> and other type modifiers
require an explicit <code>int</code>.

     <p><a name="index-typedef-names-as-function-parameters-4846"></a><li>PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.

     <li>Traditional C allows the following erroneous pair of declarations to
appear together in a given scope:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int foo;
          typedef foo foo;
</pre>
     <li>GCC treats all characters of identifiers as significant.  According to
K&amp;R-1 (2.2), &ldquo;No more than the first eight characters are significant,
although more may be used.&rdquo;.  Also according to K&amp;R-1 (2.2), &ldquo;An
identifier is a sequence of letters and digits; the first character must
be a letter.  The underscore _ counts as a letter.&rdquo;, but GCC also
allows dollar signs in identifiers.

     <p><a name="index-whitespace-4847"></a><li>PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment operators
such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+=</span></samp>&rsquo;.  GCC, following the ISO standard, does not
allow this.

     <p><a name="index-apostrophes-4848"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0027_007d-4849"></a><li>GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if these
comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an error.  For
example, this code would produce an error:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #if 0
          You can't expect this to work.
          #endif
</pre>
     <p>The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an actual
C comment delimited by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*...*/</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Many user programs contain the declaration &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long time ();</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the
past, the system header files on many systems did not actually declare
<code>time</code>, so it did not matter what type your program declared it to
return.  But in systems with ISO C headers, <code>time</code> is declared to
return <code>time_t</code>, and if that is not the same as <code>long</code>, then
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long time ();</span></samp>&rsquo; is erroneous.

     <p>The solution is to change your program to use appropriate system headers
(<code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> on systems with ISO C headers) and not to declare
<code>time</code> if the system header files declare it, or failing that to
use <code>time_t</code> as the return type of <code>time</code>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfloat_007d-as-function-value-type-4850"></a><li>When compiling functions that return <code>float</code>, PCC converts it to
a double.  GCC actually returns a <code>float</code>.  If you are concerned
with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
<code>double</code>; you might as well say what you mean.

     <p><a name="index-structures-4851"></a><a name="index-unions-4852"></a><li>When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.

     <p>The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or union
with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the caller
(usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines it is passed
on the stack).  The target hook <code>TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX</code>
tells GCC where to pass this address.

     <p>By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value. 
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  GCC does not use this method because it is
slower and nonreentrant.

     <p>On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses a
compatible convention when returning structures and unions in memory,
but still returns small structures and unions in registers.

     <p><a name="index-fpcc_002dstruct_002dreturn-4853"></a>You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure and
union returning with the option <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>.

     <p><a name="index-preprocessing-tokens-4854"></a><a name="index-preprocessing-numbers-4855"></a><li>GCC complains about program fragments such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x74ae-0x4000</span></samp>&rsquo;
which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
operator.  Actually, this string is a single <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn>. 
Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does not,
GCC prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious that what
is meant is an operator and two values, the ISO C standard specifically
requires that this be treated as erroneous.

     <p>A <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn> is a <dfn>preprocessing number</dfn> if it
begins with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
periods and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P+</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P-</span></samp>&rsquo; character sequences.  (In strict C90
mode, the sequences &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P-</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot
appear in preprocessing numbers.)

     <p>To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front of
the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing number.

<h3 class="section">13.4 Fixed Header Files</h3>

<p>GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files. 
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ISO C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.

 <p>Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called <code>fixincludes</code>.  Normally, you
don't need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it
doesn't do the right thing automatically.

     <ul>
<li>If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a new
system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not automatically
updated.  They can be updated using the <samp><span class="command">mkheaders</span></samp> script
installed in
<samp><var>libexecdir</var><span class="file">/gcc/</span><var>target</var><span class="file">/</span><var>version</var><span class="file">/install-tools/</span></samp>.

     <li>On some systems, header file directories contain
machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it
possible to share most of the header files among hosts running the
same version of the system on different machine models.

     <p>The programs that fix the header files do not understand this special
way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of fixed header
files is good only for the machine model used to build it.

     <p>It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links so
as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">13.5 Standard Libraries</h3>

<p><a name="index-Wall-4856"></a>GCC by itself attempts to be a conforming freestanding implementation. 
See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
what this means.  Beyond the library facilities required of such an
implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of
the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to the C
standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using
<samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>) that you don't expect.

 <p>For example, the <code>sprintf</code> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns
<code>char *</code> while the C standard says that <code>sprintf</code> returns an
<code>int</code>.  The <code>fixincludes</code> program could make the prototype for
this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the
function will still return <code>char *</code>.

 <p>If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called <code>glibc</code>)
provides ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for
GNU/Linux and HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports
other systems, though some very old versions did.  Version 2.2 of the
GNU C library includes nearly complete C99 support.  You could also ask
your operating system vendor if newer libraries are available.

<h3 class="section">13.6 Disappointments and Misunderstandings</h3>

<p>These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.

     <ul>
<li>Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you compile
with optimization.

     <p>This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
value such a variable &ldquo;would have had&rdquo;, and it is not clear that would
be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the eliminated
variable when it writes debugging information.

     <p>You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

     <p><a name="index-conflicting-types-4857"></a><a name="index-scope-of-declaration-4858"></a><li>Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo (struct mumble *);
          
          struct mumble { ... };
          
          int foo (struct mumble *x)
          { ... }
</pre>
     <p>This code really is erroneous, because the scope of <code>struct
mumble</code> in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it. 
It does not refer to the <code>struct mumble</code> defined with file scope
immediately below&mdash;they are two unrelated types with similar names in
different scopes.

     <p>But in the definition of <code>foo</code>, the file-scope type is used
because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and
the prototype do not match, and you get an error.

     <p>This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ISO standard specifies. 
It is easy enough for you to make your code work by moving the
definition of <code>struct mumble</code> above the prototype.  It's not worth
being incompatible with ISO C just to avoid an error for the example
shown above.

     <li>Accesses to bit-fields even in volatile objects works by accessing larger
objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what size of
object is accessed in order to read or write the bit-field; it may even
vary for a given bit-field according to the precise usage.

     <p>If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is accessed, use
volatile but do not use bit-fields.

     <li>GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in system
header files.  They install corrected copies of various header files in
a special directory where only GCC will normally look for them.  The
scripts adapt to various systems by searching all the system header
files for the problem cases that we know about.

     <p>If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically arranges
to update the corrected header files.  They can be updated using the
<samp><span class="command">mkheaders</span></samp> script installed in
<samp><var>libexecdir</var><span class="file">/gcc/</span><var>target</var><span class="file">/</span><var>version</var><span class="file">/install-tools/</span></samp>.

     <li><a name="index-floating-point-precision-4859"></a>On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical results
if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.  For example,
you can find that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
to itself.  This results from the fact that the floating point registers
hold a few more bits of precision than fit in a <code>double</code> in memory. 
Compiled code moves values between memory and floating point registers
at its convenience, and moving them into memory truncates them.

     <p><a name="index-ffloat_002dstore-4860"></a>You can partially avoid this problem by using the <samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp>
option (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>).

     <li>On AIX and other platforms without weak symbol support, templates
need to be instantiated explicitly and symbols for static members
of templates will not be generated.

     <li>On AIX, GCC scans object files and library archives for static
constructors and destructors when linking an application before the
linker prunes unreferenced symbols.  This is necessary to prevent the
AIX linker from mistakenly assuming that static constructor or
destructor are unused and removing them before the scanning can occur. 
All static constructors and destructors found will be referenced even
though the modules in which they occur may not be used by the program. 
This may lead to both increased executable size and unexpected symbol
references.

<h4 class="subsection">13.7.1 Declare <em>and</em> Define Static Members</h4>

the static member; you must also <em>define</em> it.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     class Foo
     {
       ...
       void method();
       static int bar;
     };
</pre>
 <p>This declaration only establishes that the class <code>Foo</code> has an
<code>int</code> named <code>Foo::bar</code>, and a member function named
<code>Foo::method</code>.  But you still need to define <em>both</em>
<code>method</code> and <code>bar</code> elsewhere.  According to the ISO
standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one) source
file, such as:

<pre class="smallexample">     int Foo::bar = 0;
</pre>
 <p>Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard behavior. 
As a result, when you switch to <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> from one of these compilers,
you may discover that a program that appeared to work correctly in fact
does not conform to the standard: <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> reports as undefined
symbols any static data members that lack definitions.

<h4 class="subsection">13.7.2 Name Lookup, Templates, and Accessing Members of Base Classes</h4>

<p><a name="index-base-class-members-4868"></a><a name="index-two_002dstage-name-lookup-4869"></a><a name="index-dependent-name-lookup-4870"></a>
The C++ standard prescribes that all names that are not dependent on
template parameters are bound to their present definitions when parsing
a template function or class.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>  Only names that are dependent are looked up at the point
of instantiation.  For example, consider

<pre class="smallexample">       void foo(double);
     
       struct A {
         template &lt;typename T&gt;
         void f () {
           foo (1);        // <span class="roman">1</span>
           int i = N;      // <span class="roman">2</span>
           T t;
           t.bar();        // <span class="roman">3</span>
           foo (t);        // <span class="roman">4</span>
         }
     
         static const int N;
       };
</pre>
 <p>Here, the names <code>foo</code> and <code>N</code> appear in a context that does
not depend on the type of <code>T</code>.  The compiler will thus require that
they are defined in the context of use in the template, not only before
the point of instantiation, and will here use <code>::foo(double)</code> and
<code>A::N</code>, respectively.  In particular, it will convert the integer
value to a <code>double</code> when passing it to <code>::foo(double)</code>.

 <p>Conversely, <code>bar</code> and the call to <code>foo</code> in the fourth marked
line are used in contexts that do depend on the type of <code>T</code>, so
they are only looked up at the point of instantiation, and you can
provide declarations for them after declaring the template, but before
instantiating it.  In particular, if you instantiate <code>A::f&lt;int&gt;</code>,
the last line will call an overloaded <code>::foo(int)</code> if one was
provided, even if after the declaration of <code>struct A</code>.

 <p>This distinction between lookup of dependent and non-dependent names is
called two-stage (or dependent) name lookup.  G++ implements it
since version 3.4.

 <p>Two-stage name lookup sometimes leads to situations with behavior
different from non-template codes.  The most common is probably this:

<pre class="smallexample">       template &lt;typename T&gt; struct Base {
         int i;
       };
     
       template &lt;typename T&gt; struct Derived : public Base&lt;T&gt; {
         int get_i() { return i; }
       };
</pre>
 <p>In <code>get_i()</code>, <code>i</code> is not used in a dependent context, so the
compiler will look for a name declared at the enclosing namespace scope
(which is the global scope here).  It will not look into the base class,
since that is dependent and you may declare specializations of
<code>Base</code> even after declaring <code>Derived</code>, so the compiler cannot
really know what <code>i</code> would refer to.  If there is no global
variable <code>i</code>, then you will get an error message.

 <p>In order to make it clear that you want the member of the base class,
you need to defer lookup until instantiation time, at which the base
class is known.  For this, you need to access <code>i</code> in a dependent
context, by either using <code>this-&gt;i</code> (remember that <code>this</code> is of
type <code>Derived&lt;T&gt;*</code>, so is obviously dependent), or using
<code>Base&lt;T&gt;::i</code>.  Alternatively, <code>Base&lt;T&gt;::i</code> might be brought
into scope by a <code>using</code>-declaration.

 <p>Another, similar example involves calling member functions of a base
class:

<pre class="smallexample">       template &lt;typename T&gt; struct Base {
           int f();
       };
     
       template &lt;typename T&gt; struct Derived : Base&lt;T&gt; {
           int g() { return f(); };
       };
</pre>
 <p>Again, the call to <code>f()</code> is not dependent on template arguments
(there are no arguments that depend on the type <code>T</code>, and it is also
not otherwise specified that the call should be in a dependent context). 
Thus a global declaration of such a function must be available, since
the one in the base class is not visible until instantiation time.  The
compiler will consequently produce the following error message:

<pre class="smallexample">       x.cc: In member function `int Derived&lt;T&gt;::g()':
       x.cc:6: error: there are no arguments to `f' that depend on a template
          parameter, so a declaration of `f' must be available
       x.cc:6: error: (if you use `-fpermissive', G++ will accept your code, but
          allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)
</pre>
 <p>To make the code valid either use <code>this-&gt;f()</code>, or
<code>Base&lt;T&gt;::f()</code>.  Using the <samp><span class="option">-fpermissive</span></samp> flag will also let
the compiler accept the code, by marking all function calls for which no
declaration is visible at the time of definition of the template for
later lookup at instantiation time, as if it were a dependent call. 
We do not recommend using <samp><span class="option">-fpermissive</span></samp> to work around invalid
code, and it will also only catch cases where functions in base classes
are called, not where variables in base classes are used (as in the
example above).

 <p>Note that some compilers (including G++ versions prior to 3.4) get these
examples wrong and accept above code without an error.  Those compilers
do not implement two-stage name lookup correctly.

<h4 class="subsection">13.7.3 Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect</h4>

<p><a name="index-temporaries_002c-lifetime-of-4871"></a><a name="index-portions-of-temporary-objects_002c-pointers-to-4872"></a>It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <em>portions</em> of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type <code>char *</code>
or <code>const char *</code>&mdash;which is one reason why the standard
<code>string</code> class requires you to call the <code>c_str</code> member
function.  However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal
structure is potentially subject to this problem.

 <p>For example, a program may use a function <code>strfunc</code> that returns
<code>string</code> objects, and another function <code>charfunc</code> that
operates on pointers to <code>char</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     string strfunc ();
     void charfunc (const char *);
     
     void
     f ()
     {
       const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
       ...
       charfunc (p);
       ...
       charfunc (p);
     }
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the <code>c_str</code> member function and use that rather
than call <code>c_str</code> repeatedly.  However, the temporary string
created by the call to <code>strfunc</code> is destroyed after <code>p</code> is
initialized, at which point <code>p</code> is left pointing to freed memory.

 <p>Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.

 <p>The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     const string&amp; tmp = strfunc ();
     charfunc (tmp.c_str ());

<h4 class="subsection">13.7.4 Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases</h4>

<p>When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However, such
objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct Base{
       char *name;
       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
       Base&amp; operator= (const Base&amp; other){
        free (name);
        name = strdup (other.name);
       }
     };
     
     struct A:virtual Base{
       int val;
       A():Base("A"){}
     };
     
     struct B:virtual Base{
       int bval;
       B():Base("B"){}
     };
     
     struct Derived:public A, public B{
       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
     };
     
     void func(Derived &amp;d1, Derived &amp;d2)
     {
       d1 = d2;
     }
</pre>
 <p>The C++ standard specifies that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Base::Base</span></samp>&rsquo; is only called once
when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is
unspecified whether &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Base::operator=</span></samp>&rsquo; is called more than once when
the implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
inside &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">func</span></samp>&rsquo; in the example).

 <p>G++ implements the &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; algorithm for copy-assignment: assign all
direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the virtual
base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the example, copying
proceeds in the following order: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">val</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>&rsquo; (via
<code>strdup</code>), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bval</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>&rsquo; again.

 <p>If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

<h3 class="section">13.8 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make</h3>

<p>This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GCC is better without them.

     <ul>
<li>Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

     <p>Such a feature would work only occasionally&mdash;only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

     <li>Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.

     <p>Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned. 
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

     <li>Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

     <p>Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.

     <li>Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

     <p>C contains many standard functions that return a value that most
programs choose to ignore.  One obvious example is <code>printf</code>. 
Warning about this practice only leads the defensive programmer to
clutter programs with dozens of casts to <code>void</code>.  Such casts are
required so frequently that they become visual noise.  Writing those
casts becomes so automatic that they no longer convey useful
information about the intentions of the programmer.  For functions
where the return value should never be ignored, use the
<code>warn_unused_result</code> function attribute (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

     <li><a name="index-fshort_002denums-4873"></a>Making <samp><span class="option">-fshort-enums</span></samp> the default.

     <p>This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.

     <li>Making bit-fields unsigned by default on particular machines where &ldquo;the
ABI standard&rdquo; says to do so.

     <p>The ISO C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bit-field
declared plain <code>int</code> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.

     <p><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-4874"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-4875"></a>The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the signed
dialect with <samp><span class="option">-fsigned-bitfields</span></samp> and the unsigned dialect with
<samp><span class="option">-funsigned-bitfields</span></samp>.  However, this leaves open the question of
which dialect to use by default.

     <p>Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bit-fields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <code>int</code> is the same as <code>signed int</code> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bit-fields
as well.

     <p>Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bit-fields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bit-fields distinguishes two dialects of C. 
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bit-fields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bit-fields in the same data structures.

     <p>A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects. 
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.

     <p>Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bit-fields differently on
certain machines.

     <p>Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.

     <p>This is why GCC does and will treat plain bit-fields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).

     <p>There are some arguments for making bit-fields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.

     <p>(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bit-field whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)

     <li><a name="index-ansi-4876"></a><a name="index-std-4877"></a>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> when <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> is not used.

     <p>Currently, GCC defines <code>__STDC__</code> unconditionally.  This provides
good results in practice.

     <p>Programmers normally use conditionals on <code>__STDC__</code> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ISO C, such as function
prototypes or ISO token concatenation.  Since plain <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> supports
all the features of ISO C, the correct answer to these questions is
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

     <p>Some users try to use <code>__STDC__</code> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ISO
C program, because the ISO C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <code>__STDC__</code> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc -ansi -pedantic</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <code>__STDC__</code>, even though it does not come with an ISO C
library.

     <p>Sometimes people say that defining <code>__STDC__</code> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ISO C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ISO C, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc -ansi</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;not for other
compilers such as plain <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>.  Whatever the ISO C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> without <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

     <p>GCC normally defines <code>__STDC__</code> to be 1, and in addition
defines <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> if you specify the <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> option,
or a <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option for strict conformance to some version of ISO C. 
On some hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
<code>__STDC__</code> is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention when
processing system include files, but when processing user files it follows
the usual GNU C convention.

     <li>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> in C++.

     <p>Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <code>__STDC__</code> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <code>__STDC__</code>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ISO C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.

     <p>These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <code>__STDC__</code> is defined. 
They would not work otherwise.

     <p>In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ISO
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <code>__STDC__</code> is defined.  If <code>__STDC__</code>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.

     <li>Deleting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; loops.

     <p>Historically, GCC has not deleted &ldquo;empty&rdquo; loops under the
assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a program is
to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real programs run any
faster.

     <p>However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
cannot produce an empty one. This held for carefully written C compiled
with less powerful optimizers but is not always the case for carefully
written C++ or with more powerful optimizers. 
Thus GCC will remove operations from loops whenever it can determine
those operations are not externally visible (apart from the time taken
to execute them, of course).  In case the loop can be proved to be finite,
GCC will also remove the loop itself.

     <p>Be aware of this when performing timing tests, for instance the
following loop can be completely removed, provided
<code>some_expression</code> can provably not change any global state.

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
             int sum = 0;
             int ix;
          
             for (ix = 0; ix != 10000; ix++)
                sum += some_expression;
          }
</pre>
     <p>Even though <code>sum</code> is accumulated in the loop, no use is made of
that summation, so the accumulation can be removed.

     <li>Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other compiler.

     <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-order-of-evaluation-4878"></a><a name="index-order-of-evaluation_002c-side-effects-4879"></a>It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects. 
For example, a function call like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func (int, int);
          
          int i = 2;
          func (i++, i++);
</pre>
     <p>There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular
order.  Either increment might happen first.  <code>func</code> might get the
arguments &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2, 3</span></samp>&rsquo;, or it might get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3, 2</span></samp>&rsquo;, or even &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2, 2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Making certain warnings into errors by default.

     <p>Some ISO C testsuites report failure when the compiler does not produce
an error message for a certain program.

     <p><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-4880"></a>ISO C requires a &ldquo;diagnostic&rdquo; message for certain kinds of invalid
programs, but a warning is defined by GCC to count as a diagnostic.  If
GCC produces a warning but not an error, that is correct ISO C support. 
If testsuites call this &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, they should be run with the GCC
option <samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp>, which will turn these warnings into
errors.

<h3 class="section">13.9 Warning Messages and Error Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-error-messages-4881"></a><a name="index-warnings-vs-errors-4882"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-and-error-4883"></a>The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Errors</dfn> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
number where the problem is apparent.

     <li><dfn>Warnings</dfn> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<em>may</em> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed.  Warning messages also report the source file name and line
number, but include the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning:</span></samp>&rsquo; to distinguish them
from error messages. 
</ul>

 <p>Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp>
options (for instance, <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> requests a variety of useful
warnings).

 <p><a name="index-pedantic-4884"></a><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-4885"></a>GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic <em>must</em> be issued by a conforming
compiler.  The <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> option tells GCC to issue warnings in
such cases; <samp><span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span></samp> says to make them errors instead. 
This does not mean that <em>all</em> non-ISO constructs get warnings
or errors.

 <p>See <a href="#Warning-Options">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</a>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.

Your bug reports play an essential role in making GCC reliable.

 <p>When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is
already known.  See <a href="#Trouble">Trouble</a>.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.

<h3 class="section">14.1 Have You Found a Bug?</h3>

<p><a name="index-bug-criteria-4888"></a>
If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:

     
<a name="index-fatal-signal-4889"></a>
<a name="index-core-dump-4890"></a>
<ul><li>If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

     <p><a name="index-invalid-assembly-code-4891"></a><a name="index-assembly-code_002c-invalid-4892"></a><li>If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever
(except an <code>asm</code> statement), that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

     <p><a name="index-undefined-behavior-4893"></a><a name="index-undefined-function-value-4894"></a><a name="index-increment-operators-4895"></a><li>If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

     <p>However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have a
program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to give
the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

     <p>For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x;</span></samp>&rsquo;
at the end of a function instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">return x;</span></samp>&rsquo;, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <code>return</code>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.

     <p>Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <code>f (*p++, *p++)</code>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.

     <p>After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

     <li>If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.

     <p><a name="index-invalid-input-4896"></a><li>If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
&ldquo;invalid input&rdquo; might be someone else's idea of &ldquo;an extension&rdquo; or
&ldquo;support for traditional practice&rdquo;.

     <li>If you are an experienced user of one of the languages GCC supports, your
suggestions for improvement of GCC are welcome in any case.

<h2 class="unnumbered">Funding Free Software</h2>

<p>If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

 <p>Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers&mdash;the Free Software Foundation, and others.

 <p>The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

 <p>To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, &ldquo;We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold.&rdquo;  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
&ldquo;A portion of the profits are donated,&rdquo; since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

 <p>Even a precise fraction &ldquo;of the profits from this disk&rdquo; is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. 
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

 <p>Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.

 <p>By establishing the idea that supporting further development is &ldquo;the
proper thing to do&rdquo; when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

<h2 class="unnumbered">GNU General Public License</h2>

<div align="center">Version 3, 29 June 2007</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included in another file. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
 <h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

 <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program&ndash;to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.

 <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

 <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

 <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

 <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. 
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

 <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>Definitions.

     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.

     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.

     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

     <li>Source Code.

     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
of a work.

     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

     <li>Basic Permissions.

     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
notices&rdquo;.

          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
          </ol>

     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

          </ol>

     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

     <li>Additional Terms.

     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
          </ol>

     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

     <li>Termination.

     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

     <li>Patents.

     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.

     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

     <li>Revised Versions of this License.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

     <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

     <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

     <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

     <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

     <li>Limitation of Liability.

     <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     <li>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

 <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre>
 <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; for details.
</pre>
 <p>The hypothetical commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.

 <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.

 <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

      </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
 <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with...Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
 <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

 <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<p>GCC's command line options are indexed here without any initial &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Where an option has both positive and negative forms
(such as <samp><span class="option">-f</span><var>option</var></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-</span><var>option</var></samp>),
relevant entries in the manual are indexed under the most appropriate
form; it may sometimes be useful to look up both forms.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> On some systems, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc -shared</span></samp>&rsquo;
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc -shared</span></samp>&rsquo; must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.</p>

 <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Future versions of GCC may zero-extend, or use
a target-defined <code>ptr_extend</code> pattern.  Do not rely on sign extension.</p>

 <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> The analogous feature in
Fortran is called an assigned goto, but that name seems inappropriate in
C, where one can do more than simply store label addresses in label
variables.</p>

 <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> A file's <dfn>basename</dfn>
is the name stripped of all leading path information and of trailing
suffixes, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.h</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.C</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.cc</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

 <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> The C++ standard just uses the
term &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; for names that depend on the type or value of
template parameters.  This shorter term will also be used in the rest of
this section.</p>
