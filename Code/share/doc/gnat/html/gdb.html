<h2 class="unnumbered">Summary of <span class="sc">gdb</span></h2>

<p>The purpose of a debugger such as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is to allow you to see what is
going on &ldquo;inside&rdquo; another program while it executes&mdash;or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

     <ul>
<li>Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

     <li>Make your program stop on specified conditions.

     <li>Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

     <li>Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another. 
</ul>

   <p>You can use <span class="sc">gdb</span> to debug programs written in C and C<tt>++</tt>. 
For more information, see <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>. 
For more information, see <a href="#C">C and C++</a>.

   <p>Support for D is partial.  For information on D, see
<a href="#D">D</a>.

   <p>Support for OpenCL C is partial.  For information on OpenCL C, see
<a href="#OpenCL-C">OpenCL C</a>.

   <p><a name="index-Pascal-2"></a>Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables, or
nested functions does not currently work.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not support
entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal
syntax.

   <p><a name="index-Fortran-3"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although
it may be necessary to refer to some variables with a trailing
underscore.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can be used to debug programs written in Objective-C,
using either the Apple/NeXT or the GNU Objective-C runtime.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Free Software Needs Free Documentation</h3>

<p>The biggest deficiency in the free software community today is not in
the software&mdash;it is the lack of good free documentation that we can
include with the free software.  Many of our most important
programs do not come with free reference manuals and free introductory
texts.  Documentation is an essential part of any software package;
when an important free software package does not come with a free
manual and a free tutorial, that is a major gap.  We have many such
gaps today.

   <p>Consider Perl, for instance.  The tutorial manuals that people
normally use are non-free.  How did this come about?  Because the
authors of those manuals published them with restrictive terms&mdash;no
copying, no modification, source files not available&mdash;which exclude
them from the free software world.

   <p>That wasn't the first time this sort of thing happened, and it was far
from the last.  Many times we have heard a GNU user eagerly describe a
manual that he is writing, his intended contribution to the community,
only to learn that he had ruined everything by signing a publication
contract to make it non-free.

   <p>Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers
charge a price for printed copies&mdash;that in itself is fine.  (The Free
Software Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The
problem is the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals
are available in source code form, and give you permission to copy and
modify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.

   <p>The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for
free software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of
commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can
accompany every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.

   <p>Permission for modification of the technical content is crucial too. 
When people modify the software, adding or changing features, if they
are conscientious they will change the manual too&mdash;so they can
provide accurate and clear documentation for the modified program.  A
manual that leaves you no choice but to write a new manual to document
a changed version of the program is not really available to our
community.

   <p>Some kinds of limits on the way modification is handled are
acceptable.  For example, requirements to preserve the original
author's copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of
authors, are ok.  It is also no problem to require modified versions
to include notice that they were modified.  Even entire sections that
may not be deleted or changed are acceptable, as long as they deal
with nontechnical topics (like this one).  These kinds of restrictions
are acceptable because they don't obstruct the community's normal use
of the manual.

   <p>However, it must be possible to modify all the <em>technical</em>
content of the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual
media, through all the usual channels.  Otherwise, the restrictions
obstruct the use of the manual, it is not free, and we need another
manual to replace it.

   <p>Please spread the word about this issue.  Our community continues to
lose manuals to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that
free software needs free reference manuals and free tutorials, perhaps
the next person who wants to contribute by writing documentation will
realize, before it is too late, that only free manuals contribute to
the free software community.

   <p>If you are writing documentation, please insist on publishing it under
the GNU Free Documentation License or another free documentation
license.  Remember that this decision requires your approval&mdash;you
don't have to let the publisher decide.  Some commercial publishers
will use a free license if you insist, but they will not propose the
option; it is up to you to raise the issue and say firmly that this is
what you want.  If the publisher you are dealing with refuses, please
try other publishers.  If you're not sure whether a proposed license
is free, write to <a href="mailto:licensing@gnu.org">licensing@gnu.org</a>.

   <p>You can encourage commercial publishers to sell more free, copylefted
manuals and tutorials by buying them, and particularly by buying
copies from the publishers that paid for their writing or for major
improvements.  Meanwhile, try to avoid buying non-free documentation
at all.  Check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it,
and insist that whoever seeks your business must respect your freedom. 
Check the history of the book, and try to reward the publishers that
have paid or pay the authors to work on it.

published by other publishers, at

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Contributors to <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p>Richard Stallman was the original author of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and of many
other <span class="sc">gnu</span> programs.  Many others have contributed to its
development.  This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One
of the virtues of free software is that everyone is free to contribute
to it; with regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The
file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.

   <p>Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.

   <blockquote>
<em>Plea:</em> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names! 
</blockquote>

   <p>So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded <span class="sc">gdb</span> through major
releases:
Andrew Cagney (releases 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0);
Jim Blandy (release 4.18);
Jason Molenda (release 4.17);
Stan Shebs (release 4.14);
Fred Fish (releases 4.16, 4.15, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9);
Stu Grossman and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4);
John Gilmore (releases 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9);
Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0).

<h2 class="chapter">1 A Sample <span class="sc">gdb</span> Session</h2>

<p>You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
However, a handful of commands are enough to get started using the
debugger.  This chapter illustrates those commands.

<!-- FIXME: this example may not be appropriate for some configs, where -->
<!-- FIXME...primary interest is in remote use. -->
   <p>One of the preliminary versions of <span class="sc">gnu</span> <code>m4</code> (a generic macro
processor) exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its
quote strings from the default, the commands used to capture one macro
definition within another stop working.  In the following short <code>m4</code>
session, we define a macro <code>foo</code> which expands to <code>0000</code>; we
then use the <code>m4</code> built-in <code>defn</code> to define <code>bar</code> as the
same thing.  However, when we change the open quote string to
<code>&lt;QUOTE&gt;</code> and the close quote string to <code>&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;</code>, the same
procedure fails to define a new synonym <code>baz</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ <b>cd gnu/m4</b>
     $ <b>./m4</b>
     <b>define(foo,0000)</b>
     
     <b>foo</b>
     0000
     <b>define(bar,defn(`foo'))</b>
     
     <b>bar</b>
     0000
     <b>changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)</b>
     
     <b>define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))</b>
     <b>baz</b>
     <b>Ctrl-d</b>
     m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Let us use <span class="sc">gdb</span> to try to see what is going on.

<pre class="smallexample">     $ <b>gdb m4</b>
     <!-- FIXME: this falsifies the exact text played out, to permit smallbook -->
     <!-- FIXME... format to come out better. -->

     <span class="sc">gdb</span> 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019, Copyright 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">gdb</span> reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the
rest when needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly. 
We now tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use a narrower display width than usual, so
that examples fit in this manual.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>set width 70</b>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We need to see how the <code>m4</code> built-in <code>changequote</code> works. 
Having looked at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is
<code>m4_changequote</code>, so we set a breakpoint there with the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>break</code> command.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>break m4_changequote</b>
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Using the <code>run</code> command, we start <code>m4</code> running under <span class="sc">gdb</span>
control; as long as control does not reach the <code>m4_changequote</code>
subroutine, the program runs as usual:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>run</b>
     Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
     <b>define(foo,0000)</b>
     
     <b>foo</b>
     0000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To trigger the breakpoint, we call <code>changequote</code>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
suspends execution of <code>m4</code>, displaying information about the
context where it stops.

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)</b>
     
     Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
         at builtin.c:879
     879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now we use the command <code>n</code> (<code>next</code>) to advance execution to
the next line of the current function.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>n</b>
     882         set_quotes((argc &gt;= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
      : nil,
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>set_quotes</code> looks like a promising subroutine.  We can go into it
by using the command <code>s</code> (<code>step</code>) instead of <code>next</code>. 
<code>step</code> goes to the next line to be executed in <em>any</em>
subroutine, so it steps into <code>set_quotes</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>s</b>
     set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;")
         at input.c:530
     530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The display that shows the subroutine where <code>m4</code> is now
suspended (and its arguments) is called a stack frame display.  It
shows a summary of the stack.  We can use the <code>backtrace</code>
command (which can also be spelled <code>bt</code>), to see where we are
in the stack as a whole: the <code>backtrace</code> command displays a
stack frame for each active subroutine.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>bt</b>
     #0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;", rq=0x34c88 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;")
         at input.c:530
     #1  0x6344 in m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
         at builtin.c:882
     #2  0x8174 in expand_macro (sym=0x33320) at macro.c:242
     #3  0x7a88 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=209696, td=0xf7fffa30)
         at macro.c:71
     #4  0x79dc in expand_input () at macro.c:40
     #5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We step through a few more lines to see what happens.  The first two
times, we can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;; the next two times we use <code>n</code> to avoid
falling into the <code>xstrdup</code> subroutine.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>s</b>
     0x3b5c  532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
     (gdb) <b>s</b>
     0x3b80  535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ?  \
     def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
     (gdb) <b>n</b>
     536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
      : xstrdup(rq);
     (gdb) <b>n</b>
     538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables
<code>lquote</code> and <code>rquote</code> to see if they are in fact the new left
and right quotes we specified.  We use the command <code>p</code>
(<code>print</code>) to see their values.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>p lquote</b>
     $1 = 0x35d40 "&lt;QUOTE&gt;"
     (gdb) <b>p rquote</b>
     $2 = 0x35d50 "&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>lquote</code> and <code>rquote</code> are indeed the new left and right quotes. 
To look at some context, we can display ten lines of source
surrounding the current line with the <code>l</code> (<code>list</code>) command.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>l</b>
     533             xfree(rquote);
     534
     535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ? def_lquote\
      : xstrdup (lq);
     536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
      : xstrdup (rq);
     537
     538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
     539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
     540     }
     541
     542     void
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Let us step past the two lines that set <code>len_lquote</code> and
<code>len_rquote</code>, and then examine the values of those variables.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>n</b>
     539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
     (gdb) <b>n</b>
     540     }
     (gdb) <b>p len_lquote</b>
     $3 = 9
     (gdb) <b>p len_rquote</b>
     $4 = 7
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">That certainly looks wrong, assuming <code>len_lquote</code> and
<code>len_rquote</code> are meant to be the lengths of <code>lquote</code> and
<code>rquote</code> respectively.  We can set them to better values using
the <code>p</code> command, since it can print the value of
any expression&mdash;and that expression can include subroutine calls and
assignments.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>p len_lquote=strlen(lquote)</b>
     $5 = 7
     (gdb) <b>p len_rquote=strlen(rquote)</b>
     $6 = 9
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the
<code>m4</code> built-in <code>defn</code>?  We can allow <code>m4</code> to continue
executing with the <code>c</code> (<code>continue</code>) command, and then try the
example that caused trouble initially:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>c</b>
     Continuing.
     
     <b>define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))</b>
     
     baz
     0000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Success!  The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones.  The
problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong
lengths.  We allow <code>m4</code> exit by giving it an EOF as input:

<pre class="smallexample">     <b>Ctrl-d</b>
     Program exited normally.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Program exited normally.</span></samp>&rsquo; is from <span class="sc">gdb</span>; it
indicates <code>m4</code> has finished executing.  We can end our <span class="sc">gdb</span>
session with the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>quit</code> command.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>quit</b>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Invoking <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p>Invoke <span class="sc">gdb</span> by running the program <code>gdb</code>.  Once started,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

   <p>You can also run <code>gdb</code> with a variety of arguments and options,
to specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.

   <p>The command-line options described here are designed
to cover a variety of situations; in some environments, some of these
options may effectively be unavailable.

   <p>The most usual way to start <span class="sc">gdb</span> is with one argument,
specifying an executable program:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb <var>program</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb <var>program</var> <var>core</var>
</pre>
   <p>You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb <var>program</var> 1234
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would attach <span class="sc">gdb</span> to process <code>1234</code> (unless you also have a file
named <samp><span class="file">1234</span></samp>; <span class="sc">gdb</span> does check for a core file first).

   <p>Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
complete operating system; when you use <span class="sc">gdb</span> as a remote
debugger attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of
&ldquo;process&rdquo;, and there is often no way to get a core dump.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.

   <p>You can optionally have <code>gdb</code> pass any arguments after the
executable file to the inferior using <code>--args</code>.  This option stops
option processing.
<pre class="smallexample">     gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
</pre>
   <p>This will cause <code>gdb</code> to debug <code>gcc</code>, and to set
<code>gcc</code>'s command-line arguments (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>) to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O2 -c foo.c</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>You can run <code>gdb</code> without printing the front material, which describes
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s non-warranty, by specifying <code>--silent</code>
(or <code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code>):

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb --silent
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can further control how <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts up by using command-line
options.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself can remind you of the options available.

<p class="noindent">Type

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb -help
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to display all available options and briefly describe their use
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb -h</span></samp>&rsquo; is a shorter equivalent).

   <p>All options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; option is used.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Choosing Files</h4>

<p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts, it reads any arguments other than options as
specifying an executable file and core file (or process ID).  This is
the same as if the arguments were specified by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-se</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo;) options respectively.  (<span class="sc">gdb</span> reads the
first argument that does not have an associated option flag as
equivalent to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-se</span></samp>&rsquo; option followed by that argument; and the
second argument that does not have an associated option flag, if any, as
equivalent to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; option followed by that argument.) 
If the second argument begins with a decimal digit, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
first attempt to attach to it as a process, and if that fails, attempt
to open it as a corefile.  If you have a corefile whose name begins with
a digit, you can prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from treating it as a pid by
prefixing it with <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp>, e.g. <samp><span class="file">./12345</span></samp>.

   <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> has not been configured to included core file support,
such as for most embedded targets, then it will complain about a second
argument and ignore it.

   <p>Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the
following list.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> also recognizes the long forms if you truncate
them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous. 
(If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo; rather
than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Choosing Modes</h4>

<p>You can run <span class="sc">gdb</span> in various alternative modes&mdash;for example, in
batch mode or quiet mode.

     <dl>
<a name="g_t_002dnx"></a><dt><code>-nx</code><dt><code>-n</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dnx_007d-26"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dn_007d-27"></a>Do not execute commands found in any initialization file. 
There are three init files, loaded in the following order:

          <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">system.gdbinit</span></samp><dd>This is the system-wide init file. 
Its location is specified with the <code>--with-system-gdbinit</code>
configure option (see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>). 
It is loaded first when <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts, before command line options
have been processed. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp><dd>This is the init file in your home directory. 
It is loaded next, after <samp><span class="file">system.gdbinit</span></samp>, and before
command options have been processed. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">./.gdbinit</span></samp><dd>This is the init file in the current directory. 
It is loaded last, after command line options other than <code>-x</code> and
<code>-ex</code> have been processed.  Command line options <code>-x</code> and
<code>-ex</code> are processed last, after <samp><span class="file">./.gdbinit</span></samp> has been loaded. 
</dl>

     <p>For further documentation on startup processing, See <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>. 
For documentation on how to write command files,
See <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>.

     <p><a name="g_t_002dnh"></a><br><dt><code>-nh</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dnh_007d-28"></a>Do not execute commands found in <samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp>, the init file
in your home directory. 
See <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-quiet</code><dt><code>-silent</code><dt><code>-q</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dquiet_007d-29"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dsilent_007d-30"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dq_007d-31"></a>&ldquo;Quiet&rdquo;.  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These
messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

     <br><dt><code>-batch</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dbatch_007d-32"></a>Run in batch mode.  Exit with status <code>0</code> after processing all the
command files specified with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; (and all commands from
initialization files, if not inhibited with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Exit with
nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands
in the command files.  Batch mode also disables pagination, sets unlimited
terminal width and height see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>, and acts as if <kbd>set confirm
off</kbd> were in effect (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Messages/Warnings</a>).

     <p>Batch mode may be useful for running <span class="sc">gdb</span> as a filter, for
example to download and run a program on another computer; in order to
make this more useful, the message

     <pre class="smallexample">          Program exited normally.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under
<span class="sc">gdb</span> control terminates) is not issued when running in batch
mode.

     <br><dt><code>-batch-silent</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dbatch_002dsilent_007d-33"></a>Run in batch mode exactly like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>&rsquo;, but totally silently.  All
<span class="sc">gdb</span> output to <code>stdout</code> is prevented (<code>stderr</code> is
unaffected).  This is much quieter than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-silent</span></samp>&rsquo; and would be useless
for an interactive session.

     <p>This is particularly useful when using targets that give &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Loading section</span></samp>&rsquo;
messages, for example.

     <p>Note that targets that give their output via <span class="sc">gdb</span>, as opposed to
writing directly to <code>stdout</code>, will also be made silent.

     <br><dt><code>-return-child-result</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dreturn_002dchild_002dresult_007d-34"></a>The return code from <span class="sc">gdb</span> will be the return code from the child
process (the process being debugged), with the following exceptions:

          <ul>
<li><span class="sc">gdb</span> exits abnormally.  E.g., due to an incorrect argument or an
internal error.  In this case the exit code is the same as it would have been
without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-return-child-result</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>The user quits with an explicit value.  E.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quit 1</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>The child process never runs, or is not allowed to terminate, in which case
the exit code will be -1. 
</ul>

     <p>This option is useful in conjunction with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-batch-silent</span></samp>&rsquo;,
when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is being used as a remote program loader or simulator
interface.

     <br><dt><code>-nowindows</code><dt><code>-nw</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dnowindows_007d-35"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dnw_007d-36"></a>&ldquo;No windows&rdquo;.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span> comes with a graphical user interface
(GUI) built in, then this option tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to only use the command-line
interface.  If no GUI is available, this option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>-windows</code><dt><code>-w</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dwindows_007d-37"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dw_007d-38"></a>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> includes a GUI, then this option requires it to be
used if possible.

     <br><dt><code>-cd </code><var>directory</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dcd_007d-39"></a>Run <span class="sc">gdb</span> using <var>directory</var> as its working directory,
instead of the current directory.

subprocess.  It tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to output the full file name and line
number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is
displayed (which includes each time your program stops).  This
recognizable format looks like two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\032</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, followed by
the file name, line number and character position separated by colons,
and a newline.  The Emacs-to-<span class="sc">gdb</span> interface program uses the two
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\032</span></samp>&rsquo; characters as a signal to display the source code for the
frame.

     <br><dt><code>-annotate </code><var>level</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dannotate_007d-44"></a>This option sets the <dfn>annotation level</dfn> inside <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Its
effect is identical to using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set annotate </span><var>level</var></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#Annotations">Annotations</a>).  The annotation <var>level</var> controls how much
information <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints together with its prompt, values of
expressions, source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0 is the
normal, level 1 is for use when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is run as a subprocess of
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable for programs
that control <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and level 2 has been deprecated.

     <p>The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>
(see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">GDB/MI</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.3 What <span class="sc">gdb</span> Does During Startup</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-startup-57"></a>
Here's the description of what <span class="sc">gdb</span> does during session startup:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Sets up the command interpreter as specified by the command line
(see <a href="#Mode-Options">interpreter</a>).

     <li><a name="index-init-file-58"></a>Reads the system-wide <dfn>init file</dfn> (if <samp><span class="option">--with-system-gdbinit</span></samp> was
used when building <span class="sc">gdb</span>; see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration and settings</a>) and executes all the commands in
that file.

     <p><a name="Home-Directory-Init-File"></a><li>Reads the init file (if any) in your home directory<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and executes all the commands in
that file.

     <p><a name="Option-_002dinit_002deval_002dcommand"></a><li>Executes commands and command files specified by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-iex</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ix</span></samp>&rsquo; options in their specified order.  Usually you should use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ex</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; options instead, but this way you can apply
settings before <span class="sc">gdb</span> init files get executed and before inferior
gets loaded.

     <li>Processes command line options and operands.

     <p><a name="Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup"></a><li>Reads and executes the commands from init file (if any) in the current
working directory as long as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load local-gdbinit</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="#Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory">Init File in the Current Directory</a>). 
This is only done if the current directory is
different from your home directory.  Thus, you can have more than one
init file, one generic in your home directory, and another, specific
to the program you are debugging, in the directory where you invoke
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <li>If the command line specified a program to debug, or a process to
attach to, or a core file, <span class="sc">gdb</span> loads any auto-loaded
scripts provided for the program or for its loaded shared libraries. 
See <a href="#Auto_002dloading">Auto-loading</a>.

     <p>If you wish to disable the auto-loading during startup,
you must do something like the following:

     <pre class="smallexample">          $ gdb -iex "set auto-load python-scripts off" myprogram
</pre>
     <p>Option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ex</span></samp>&rsquo; does not work because the auto-loading is then turned
off too late.

     <li>Executes commands and command files specified by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ex</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; options in their specified order.  See <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>, for
more details about <span class="sc">gdb</span> command files.

     <li>Reads the command history recorded in the <dfn>history file</dfn>. 
See <a href="#Command-History">Command History</a>, for more details about the command history and the
files where <span class="sc">gdb</span> records it.
        </ol>

   <p>Init files use the same syntax as <dfn>command files</dfn> (see <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>) and are processed by <span class="sc">gdb</span> in the same way.  The init
file in your home directory can set options (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
complaints</span></samp>&rsquo;) that affect subsequent processing of command line options
and operands.  Init files are not executed if you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-nx</span></samp>&rsquo;
option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>).

   <p>To display the list of init files loaded by gdb at startup, you

<h3 class="section">3.1 Command Syntax</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is a single line of input.  There is no limit on
how long it can be.  It starts with a command name, which is followed by
arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.  For example, the
command <code>step</code> accepts an argument which is the number of times to
step, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step 5</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can also use the <code>step</code> command
with no arguments.  Some commands do not allow any arguments.

   <p><a name="index-abbreviation-77"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
unambiguous.  Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the
documentation for individual commands.  In some cases, even ambiguous
abbreviations are allowed; for example, <code>s</code> is specially defined as
equivalent to <code>step</code> even though there are other commands whose
names start with <code>s</code>.  You can test abbreviations by using them as
arguments to the <code>help</code> command.

   <p><a name="index-repeating-commands-78"></a><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028repeat-last-command_0029_007d-79"></a>A blank line as input to <span class="sc">gdb</span> (typing just &lt;RET&gt;) means to
repeat the previous command.  Certain commands (for example, <code>run</code>)
will not repeat this way; these are commands whose unintentional
repetition might cause trouble and which you are unlikely to want to
repeat.  User-defined commands can disable this feature; see
<a href="#Define">dont-repeat</a>.

   <p>The <code>list</code> and <code>x</code> commands, when you repeat them with
&lt;RET&gt;, construct new arguments rather than repeating
exactly as typed.  This permits easy scanning of source or memory.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can also use &lt;RET&gt; in another way: to partition lengthy
output, in a way similar to the common utility <code>more</code>
(see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  Since it is easy to press one
&lt;RET&gt; too many in this situation, <span class="sc">gdb</span> disables command
repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0023-_0040r_007b_0028a-comment_0029_007d-80"></a><a name="index-comment-81"></a>Any text from a <kbd>#</kbd> to the end of the line is a comment; it does
nothing.  This is useful mainly in command files (see <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>).

commands.  This command accepts the current line, like &lt;RET&gt;, and
then fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history
for editing.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Command Completion</h3>

<p><a name="index-completion-84"></a><a name="index-word-completion-85"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is
only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities
are for the next word in a command, at any time.  This works for <span class="sc">gdb</span>
commands, <span class="sc">gdb</span> subcommands, and the names of symbols in your program.

   <p>Press the &lt;TAB&gt; key whenever you want <span class="sc">gdb</span> to fill out the rest
of a word.  If there is only one possibility, <span class="sc">gdb</span> fills in the
word, and waits for you to finish the command (or press &lt;RET&gt; to
enter it).  For example, if you type

<!-- FIXME "@key" does not distinguish its argument sufficiently to permit -->
<!-- complete accuracy in these examples; space introduced for clarity. -->
<!-- If texinfo enhancements make it unnecessary, it would be nice to -->
<!-- replace " @key" by "@key" in the following... -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info bre &lt;TAB&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">gdb</span> fills in the rest of the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">breakpoints</span></samp>&rsquo;, since that is
the only <code>info</code> subcommand beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bre</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info breakpoints
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can either press &lt;RET&gt; at this point, to run the <code>info
breakpoints</code> command, or backspace and enter something else, if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">breakpoints</span></samp>&rsquo; does not look like the command you expected.  (If you
were sure you wanted <code>info breakpoints</code> in the first place, you
might as well just type &lt;RET&gt; immediately after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info bre</span></samp>&rsquo;,
to exploit command abbreviations rather than command completion).

   <p>If there is more than one possibility for the next word when you press
&lt;TAB&gt;, <span class="sc">gdb</span> sounds a bell.  You can either supply more
characters and try again, or just press &lt;TAB&gt; a second time;
<span class="sc">gdb</span> displays all the possible completions for that word.  For
example, you might want to set a breakpoint on a subroutine whose name
begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make_</span></samp>&rsquo;, but when you type <kbd>b make_&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> <span class="sc">gdb</span>
just sounds the bell.  Typing &lt;TAB&gt; again displays all the
function names in your program that begin with those characters, for
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) b make_ &lt;TAB&gt;
<br><span class="sc">gdb</span> sounds bell; press &lt;TAB&gt; again, to see:<br>
     make_a_section_from_file     make_environ
     make_abs_section             make_function_type
     make_blockvector             make_pointer_type
     make_cleanup                 make_reference_type
     make_command                 make_symbol_completion_list
     (gdb) b make_
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After displaying the available possibilities, <span class="sc">gdb</span> copies your
partial input (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b make_</span></samp>&rsquo; in the example) so you can finish the
command.

   <p>If you just want to see the list of alternatives in the first place, you
can press <kbd>M-?</kbd> rather than pressing &lt;TAB&gt; twice.  <kbd>M-?</kbd>
means <kbd>&lt;META&gt; ?</kbd>.  You can type this either by holding down a
key designated as the &lt;META&gt; shift on your keyboard (if there is
one) while typing <kbd>?</kbd>, or as &lt;ESC&gt; followed by <kbd>?</kbd>.

   <p>If the number of possible completions is large, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
print as much of the list as it has collected, as well as a message
indicating that the list may be truncated.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) b m&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;
     main
     &lt;... the rest of the possible completions ...&gt;
     *** List may be truncated, max-completions reached. ***
     (gdb) b m
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This behavior can be controlled with the following commands:

     
<a name="index-set-max_002dcompletions-86"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set max-completions </code><var>limit</var><dt><code>set max-completions unlimited</code><dd>Set the maximum number of completion candidates.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
stop looking for more completions once it collects this many candidates. 
This is useful when completing on things like function names as collecting
all the possible candidates can be time consuming. 
The default value is 200.  A value of zero disables tab-completion. 
Note that setting either no limit or a very large limit can make
completion slow. 
<a name="index-show-max_002dcompletions-87"></a><br><dt><code>show max-completions</code><dd>Show the maximum number of candidates that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will collect and show
during completion. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-quotes-in-commands-88"></a><a name="index-completion-of-quoted-strings-89"></a>Sometimes the string you need, while logically a &ldquo;word&rdquo;, may contain
parentheses or other characters that <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally excludes from
its notion of a word.  To permit word completion to work in this
situation, you may enclose words in <code>'</code> (single quote marks) in
<span class="sc">gdb</span> commands.

   <p>The most likely situation where you might need this is in typing the
name of a C<tt>++</tt> function.  This is because C<tt>++</tt> allows function
overloading (multiple definitions of the same function, distinguished
by argument type).  For example, when you want to set a breakpoint you
may need to distinguish whether you mean the version of <code>name</code>
that takes an <code>int</code> parameter, <code>name(int)</code>, or the version
that takes a <code>float</code> parameter, <code>name(float)</code>.  To use the
word-completion facilities in this situation, type a single quote
<code>'</code> at the beginning of the function name.  This alerts
<span class="sc">gdb</span> that it may need to consider more information than usual
when you press &lt;TAB&gt; or <kbd>M-?</kbd> to request word completion:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) b 'bubble( <kbd>M-?</kbd>
     bubble(double,double)    bubble(int,int)
     (gdb) b 'bubble(
</pre>
   <p>In some cases, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can tell that completing a name requires using
quotes.  When this happens, <span class="sc">gdb</span> inserts the quote for you (while
completing as much as it can) if you do not type the quote in the first
place:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) b bub &lt;TAB&gt;
<br><span class="sc">gdb</span> alters your input line to the following, and rings a bell:<br>
     (gdb) b 'bubble(
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In general, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can tell that a quote is needed (and inserts it) if
you have not yet started typing the argument list when you ask for
completion on an overloaded symbol.

   <p>For more information about overloaded functions, see <a href="#C-Plus-Plus-Expressions">C<tt>++</tt> Expressions</a>.  You can use the command <code>set
overload-resolution off</code> to disable overload resolution;
see <a href="#Debugging-C-Plus-Plus"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Features for C<tt>++</tt></a>.

   <p><a name="index-completion-of-structure-field-names-90"></a><a name="index-structure-field-name-completion-91"></a><a name="index-completion-of-union-field-names-92"></a><a name="index-union-field-name-completion-93"></a>When completing in an expression which looks up a field in a
structure, <span class="sc">gdb</span> also tries<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> to
limit completions to the field names available in the type of the
left-hand-side:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p gdb_stdout.<kbd>M-?</kbd>
     magic                to_fputs             to_rewind

     to_flush             to_read
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is because the <code>gdb_stdout</code> is a variable of the type
<code>struct ui_file</code> that is defined in <span class="sc">gdb</span> sources as
follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct ui_file

<h3 class="section">4.1 Compiling for Debugging</h3>

<p>In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate
debugging information when you compile it.  This debugging information
is stored in the object file; it describes the data type of each
variable or function and the correspondence between source line numbers
and addresses in the executable code.

   <p>To request debugging information, specify the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; option when you run
the compiler.

   <p>Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with
optimizations, using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler option.  However, some
compilers are unable to handle the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo; options
together.  Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized
executables containing debugging information.

   <p><span class="sc">gcc</span>, the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C/C<tt>++</tt> compiler, supports &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; with or
without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo;, making it possible to debug optimized code.  We
recommend that you <em>always</em> use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; whenever you compile a
program.  You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense
in pushing your luck.  For more information, see <a href="#Optimized-Code">Optimized Code</a>.

   <p>Older versions of the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C compiler permitted a variant option
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-gg</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> for debugging information.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> no longer supports this
format; if your <span class="sc">gnu</span> C compiler has this option, do not use it.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their
expansion (see <a href="#Macros">Macros</a>).  Most compilers do not include information
about preprocessor macros in the debugging information if you specify
the <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> flag alone.  Version 3.1 and later of <span class="sc">gcc</span>,
the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C compiler, provides macro information if you are using
the DWARF debugging format, and specify the option <samp><span class="option">-g3</span></samp>.

   <p>See <a href="gcc.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</a>, for more
information on <span class="sc">gcc</span> options affecting debug information.

   <p>You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest
version of the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports. 
DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging
format in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<a name="index-r-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007brun_007d_0029_007d-115"></a>
<dl><dt><code>run</code><dt><code>r</code><dd>Use the <code>run</code> command to start your program under <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
You must first specify the program name with an argument to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="#Invocation">Getting In and Out of <span class="sc">gdb</span></a>), or by using the <code>file</code> or <code>exec-file</code>
command (see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

   </dl>

   <p>If you are running your program in an execution environment that
supports processes, <code>run</code> creates an inferior process and makes
that process run your program.  In some environments without processes,
<code>run</code> jumps to the start of your program.  Other targets,
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">remote</span></samp>&rsquo;, are always running.  If you get an error
message like this one:

<pre class="smallexample">     The "remote" target does not support "run".
     Try "help target" or "continue".
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then use <code>continue</code> to run your program.  You may need <code>load</code>
first (see <a href="#load">load</a>).

   <p>The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives from its superior.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do <em>before</em> starting your program.  (You
can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
your program the next time you start it.)  This information may be
divided into four categories:

     <dl>
<dt>The <em>arguments.</em><dd>Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
<code>run</code> command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions
(such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing
the arguments. 
In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable.  If you do not define <code>SHELL</code>,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the default shell (<samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>).  You can disable
use of any shell with the <code>set startup-with-shell</code> command (see
below for details).

     <br><dt>The <em>environment.</em><dd>Your program normally inherits its environment from <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but you can
use the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands <code>set environment</code> and <code>unset
environment</code> to change parts of the environment that affect
your program.  See <a href="#Environment">Your Program's Environment</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>working directory.</em><dd>Your program inherits its working directory from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  You can set
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory with the <code>cd</code> command in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
See <a href="#Working-Directory">Your Program's Working Directory</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>standard input and output.</em><dd>Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
standard output as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is using.  You can redirect input and output
in the <code>run</code> command line, or you can use the <code>tty</code> command to
set a different device for your program. 
See <a href="#Input_002fOutput">Your Program's Input and Output</a>.

     <p><a name="index-pipes-116"></a><em>Warning:</em> While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another
program; if you attempt this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is likely to wind up debugging the
wrong program. 
</dl>

   <p>When you issue the <code>run</code> command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  See <a href="#Stopping">Stopping and Continuing</a>, for discussion
of how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has
stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the <code>print</code>
or <code>call</code> commands.  See <a href="#Data">Examining Data</a>.

   <p>If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last
time <span class="sc">gdb</span> read its symbols, <span class="sc">gdb</span> discards its symbol
table, and reads it again.  When it does this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to retain
your current breakpoints.

     
<a name="index-start-117"></a>
<dl><dt><code>start</code><dd><a name="index-run-to-main-procedure-118"></a>The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language. 
With C or C<tt>++</tt>, the main procedure name is always <code>main</code>, but
other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their
main procedure.  The debugger provides a convenient way to start the
execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main
procedure, depending on the language used.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

     <p><a name="index-elaboration-phase-119"></a>Some programs contain an <dfn>elaboration</dfn> phase where some startup code is
executed before the main procedure is called.  This depends on the
languages used to write your program.  In C<tt>++</tt>, for instance,
constructors for static and global objects are executed before
<code>main</code> is called.  It is therefore possible that the debugger stops
before reaching the main procedure.  However, the temporary breakpoint
will remain to halt execution.

     <p>Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  These arguments will be given verbatim to the
underlying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  Note that the same arguments will be
reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration.  In
these cases, using the <code>start</code> command would stop the execution of
your program too late, as the program would have already completed the
elaboration phase.  Under these circumstances, insert breakpoints in your
elaboration code before running your program.

     <p><a name="set-exec_002dwrapper"></a><a name="index-set-exec_002dwrapper-120"></a><br><dt><code>set exec-wrapper </code><var>wrapper</var><dt><code>show exec-wrapper</code><dt><code>unset exec-wrapper</code><dd>When &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exec-wrapper</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, the specified wrapper is used to
launch programs for debugging.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts your program
with a shell command of the form <kbd>exec </kbd><var>wrapper</var>
<var>program</var>.  Quoting is added to <var>program</var> and its
arguments, but not to <var>wrapper</var>, so you should add quotes if
appropriate for your shell.  The wrapper runs until it executes
your program, and then <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes control.

     <p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec "$@"</code> will also work.

     <p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell's
environment:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set exec-wrapper env 'LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so'
          (gdb) run
</pre>
     <p>This command is available when debugging locally on most targets, excluding
<span class="sc">djgpp</span>, Cygwin, MS Windows, and QNX Neutrino.

     <p><a name="index-set-startup_002dwith_002dshell-121"></a><br><dt><code>set startup-with-shell</code><dt><code>set startup-with-shell on</code><dt><code>set startup-with-shell off</code><dt><code>show set startup-with-shell</code><dd>On Unix systems, by default, if a shell is available on your target,
<span class="sc">gdb</span>) uses it to start your program.  Arguments of the
<code>run</code> command are passed to the shell, which does variable
substitution, expands wildcard characters and performs redirection of
I/O.  In some circumstances, it may be useful to disable such use of a
shell, for example, when debugging the shell itself or diagnosing
startup failures such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          During startup program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which indicates the shell or the wrapper specified with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exec-wrapper</span></samp>&rsquo; crashed, not your program.  Most often, this is
caused by something odd in your shell's non-interactive mode
initialization file&mdash;such as <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp> for C-shell,
$<samp><span class="file">.zshenv</span></samp> for the Z shell, or the file specified in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BASH_ENV</span></samp>&rsquo; environment variable for BASH.

     <p><a name="set-auto_002dconnect_002dnative_002dtarget"></a><a name="index-set-auto_002dconnect_002dnative_002dtarget-122"></a><br><dt><code>set auto-connect-native-target</code><dt><code>set auto-connect-native-target on</code><dt><code>set auto-connect-native-target off</code><dt><code>show auto-connect-native-target</code><dd>
By default, if not connected to any target yet (e.g., with
<code>target remote</code>), the <code>run</code> command starts your program as a
native process under <span class="sc">gdb</span>, on your local machine.  If you're
sure you don't want to debug programs on your local machine, you can
tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to not connect to the native target automatically
with the <code>set auto-connect-native-target off</code> command.

     <p>If <code>on</code>, which is the default, and if <span class="sc">gdb</span> is not
connected to a target already, the <code>run</code> command automaticaly
connects to the native target, if one is available.

     <p>If <code>off</code>, and if <span class="sc">gdb</span> is not connected to a target
already, the <code>run</code> command fails with an error:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) run
          Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".
</pre>
     <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is already connected to a target, <span class="sc">gdb</span> always
uses it with the <code>run</code> command.

     <p>In any case, you can explicitly connect to the native target with the
<code>target native</code> command.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set auto-connect-native-target off
          (gdb) run
          Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".
          (gdb) target native
          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          [Inferior 1 (process 10421) exited normally]
</pre>
     <p>In case you connected explicitly to the <code>native</code> target,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> remains connected even if all inferiors exit, ready for
the next <code>run</code> command.  Use the <code>disconnect</code> command to
disconnect.

     <p>Examples of other commands that likewise respect the
<code>auto-connect-native-target</code> setting: <code>attach</code>, <code>info
proc</code>, <code>info os</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-disable_002drandomization-123"></a><br><dt><code>set disable-randomization</code><dt><code>set disable-randomization on</code><dd>This option (enabled by default in <span class="sc">gdb</span>) will turn off the native
randomization of the virtual address space of the started program.  This option
is useful for multiple debugging sessions to make the execution better
reproducible and memory addresses reusable across debugging sessions.

     <p>This feature is implemented only on certain targets, including <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux. 
On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux you can get the same behavior using

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set exec-wrapper setarch `uname -m` -R
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>set disable-randomization off</code><dd>Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged.  Some bugs rear their
ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain addresses.  If your bug
disappears when you run the program under <span class="sc">gdb</span>, that might be because
<span class="sc">gdb</span> by default disables the address randomization on platforms, such
as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, which do that for stand-alone programs.  Use <kbd>set
disable-randomization off</kbd> to try to reproduce such elusive bugs.

     <p>On targets where it is available, virtual address space randomization
protects the programs against certain kinds of security attacks.  In these
cases the attacker needs to know the exact location of a concrete executable
code.  Randomizing its location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing
a code at its expected addresses.

     <p>Prelinking shared libraries provides a startup performance advantage but it
makes addresses in these libraries predictable for privileged processes by
having just unprivileged access at the target system.  Reading the shared
library binary gives enough information for assembling the malicious code
misusing it.  Still even a prelinked shared library can get loaded at a new
random address just requiring the regular relocation process during the
startup.  Shared libraries not already prelinked are always loaded at
a randomly chosen address.

     <p>Position independent executables (PIE) contain position independent code
similar to the shared libraries and therefore such executables get loaded at
a randomly chosen address upon startup.  PIE executables always load even
already prelinked shared libraries at a random address.  You can build such
executable using <samp><span class="command">gcc -fPIE -pie</span></samp>.

     <p>Heap (malloc storage), stack and custom mmap areas are always placed randomly
(as long as the randomization is enabled).

     <br><dt><code>show disable-randomization</code><dd>Show the current setting of the explicit disable of the native randomization of
the virtual address space of the started program.

your user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search
path for programs to run.  Usually you set up environment variables with
the shell and they are inherited by all the other programs you run.  When
debugging, it can be useful to try running your program with a modified
environment without having to start <span class="sc">gdb</span> over again.

     
<a name="index-path-128"></a>
<dl><dt><code>path </code><var>directory</var><dd>Add <var>directory</var> to the front of the <code>PATH</code> environment variable
(the search path for executables) that will be passed to your program. 
The value of <code>PATH</code> used by <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not change. 
You may specify several directory names, separated by whitespace or by a
system-dependent separator character (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; on Unix, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; on
MS-DOS and MS-Windows).  If <var>directory</var> is already in the path, it
is moved to the front, so it is searched sooner.

     <p>You can use the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$cwd</span></samp>&rsquo; to refer to whatever is the current
working directory at the time <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches the path.  If you
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; instead, it refers to the directory where you executed the
<code>path</code> command.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> replaces &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
<var>directory</var> argument (with the current path) before adding
<var>directory</var> to the search path. 
<!-- 'path' is explicitly nonrepeatable, but RMS points out it is silly to -->
<!-- document that, since repeating it would be a no-op. -->

     <p><a name="index-show-paths-129"></a><br><dt><code>show paths</code><dd>Display the list of search paths for executables (the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable).

your program when it starts.  If you do not supply <var>varname</var>,
print the names and values of all environment variables to be given to
your program.  You can abbreviate <code>environment</code> as <code>env</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-environment-131"></a><br><dt><code>set environment </code><var>varname</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>value</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Set environment variable <var>varname</var> to <var>value</var>.  The value
changes for your program (and the shell <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to launch
it), not for <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself.  The <var>value</var> may be any string; the
values of environment variables are just strings, and any
interpretation is supplied by your program itself.  The <var>value</var>
parameter is optional; if it is eliminated, the variable is set to a
null value. 
<!-- "any string" here does not include leading, trailing -->
<!-- blanks. Gnu asks: does anyone care? -->

     <p>For example, this command:

     <pre class="smallexample">          set env USER = foo
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">tells the debugged program, when subsequently run, that its user is named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The spaces around &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; are used for clarity here; they
are not actually required.)

     <p>Note that on Unix systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> runs your program via a shell,
which also inherits the environment set with <code>set environment</code>. 
If necessary, you can avoid that by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">env</span></samp>&rsquo; program as a
wrapper instead of using <code>set environment</code>.  See <a href="#set-exec_002dwrapper">set exec-wrapper</a>, for an example doing just that.

     <p><a name="index-unset-environment-132"></a><br><dt><code>unset environment </code><var>varname</var><dd>Remove variable <var>varname</var> from the environment to be passed to your
program.  This is different from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set env </span><var>varname</var><span class="samp"> =</span></samp>&rsquo;;
<code>unset environment</code> removes the variable from the environment,
rather than assigning it an empty value. 
</dl>

   <p><em>Warning:</em> On Unix systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> runs your program using
the shell indicated by your <code>SHELL</code> environment variable if it
exists (or <code>/bin/sh</code> if not).  If your <code>SHELL</code> variable
names a shell that runs an initialization file when started
non-interactively&mdash;such as <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp> for C-shell, $<samp><span class="file">.zshenv</span></samp>
for the Z shell, or the file specified in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BASH_ENV</span></samp>&rsquo;
environment variable for BASH&mdash;any variables you set in that file
affect your program.  You may wish to move setting of environment
variables to files that are only run when you sign on, such as
<samp><span class="file">.login</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">4.5 Your Program's Working Directory</h3>

<p><a name="index-working-directory-_0028of-your-program_0029-133"></a>Each time you start your program with <code>run</code>, it inherits its
working directory from the current working directory of <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
The <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory is initially whatever it inherited
from its parent process (typically the shell), but you can specify a new
working directory in <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the <code>cd</code> command.

   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory also serves as a default for the commands
that specify files for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to operate on.  See <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.

     
<a name="index-cd-134"></a>
<a name="index-change-working-directory-135"></a>
<dl><dt><code>cd </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>directory</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Set the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory to <var>directory</var>.  If not

   <p>It is generally impossible to find the current working directory of
the process being debugged (since a program can change its directory
during its run).  If you work on a system where <span class="sc">gdb</span> is
configured with the <samp><span class="file">/proc</span></samp> support, you can use the <code>info
proc</code> command (see <a href="#SVR4-Process-Information">SVR4 Process Information</a>) to find out the
current working directory of the debuggee.

<h3 class="section">4.6 Your Program's Input and Output</h3>

<p><a name="index-redirection-137"></a><a name="index-i_002fo-138"></a><a name="index-terminal-139"></a>By default, the program you run under <span class="sc">gdb</span> does input and output to
the same terminal that <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> switches the terminal
to its own terminal modes to interact with you, but it records the terminal
modes your program was using and switches back to them when you continue
running your program.

     
<a name="index-info-terminal-140"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info terminal</code><dd>Displays information recorded by <span class="sc">gdb</span> about the terminal modes your
program is using. 
</dl>

   <p>You can redirect your program's input and/or output using shell
redirection with the <code>run</code> command.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     run &gt; outfile
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">starts your program, diverting its output to the file <samp><span class="file">outfile</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-tty-141"></a><a name="index-controlling-terminal-142"></a>Another way to specify where your program should do input and output is
with the <code>tty</code> command.  This command accepts a file name as
argument, and causes this file to be the default for future <code>run</code>
commands.  It also resets the controlling terminal for the child
process, for future <code>run</code> commands.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     tty /dev/ttyb
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">directs that processes started with subsequent <code>run</code> commands
default to do input and output on the terminal <samp><span class="file">/dev/ttyb</span></samp> and have
that as their controlling terminal.

   <p>An explicit redirection in <code>run</code> overrides the <code>tty</code> command's
effect on the input/output device, but not its effect on the controlling
terminal.

   <p>When you use the <code>tty</code> command or redirect input in the <code>run</code>
command, only the input <em>for your program</em> is affected.  The input
for <span class="sc">gdb</span> still comes from your terminal.  <code>tty</code> is an alias
for <code>set inferior-tty</code>.

   <p><a name="index-inferior-tty-143"></a><a name="index-set-inferior-controlling-terminal-144"></a>You can use the <code>show inferior-tty</code> command to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to
display the name of the terminal that will be used for future runs of your
program.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set inferior-tty /dev/ttyb</code><dd><a name="index-set-inferior_002dtty-145"></a>Set the tty for the program being debugged to /dev/ttyb.

     <dl>
<dt><code>attach </code><var>process-id</var><dd>This command attaches to a running process&mdash;one that was started
outside <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  (<code>info files</code> shows your active
targets.)  The command takes as argument a process ID.  The usual way to
find out the <var>process-id</var> of a Unix process is with the <code>ps</code> utility,
or with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">jobs -l</span></samp>&rsquo; shell command.

     <p><code>attach</code> does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; a second time after
executing the command. 
</dl>

   <p>To use <code>attach</code>, your program must be running in an environment
which supports processes; for example, <code>attach</code> does not work for
programs on bare-board targets that lack an operating system.  You must
also have permission to send the process a signal.

   <p>When you use <code>attach</code>, the debugger finds the program running in
the process first by looking in the current working directory, then (if
the program is not found) by using the source file search path
(see <a href="#Source-Path">Specifying Source Directories</a>).  You can also use
the <code>file</code> command to load the program.  See <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.

   <p>The first thing <span class="sc">gdb</span> does after arranging to debug the specified
process is to stop it.  You can examine and modify an attached process
with all the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands that are ordinarily available when
you start processes with <code>run</code>.  You can insert breakpoints; you
can step and continue; you can modify storage.  If you would rather the
process continue running, you may use the <code>continue</code> command after
attaching <span class="sc">gdb</span> to the process.

     
<a name="index-detach-149"></a>
<dl><dt><code>detach</code><dd>When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
<code>detach</code> command to release it from <span class="sc">gdb</span> control.  Detaching
the process continues its execution.  After the <code>detach</code> command,
that process and <span class="sc">gdb</span> become completely independent once more, and you
are ready to <code>attach</code> another process or start one with <code>run</code>. 
<code>detach</code> does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; again after
executing the command. 
</dl>

   <p>If you exit <span class="sc">gdb</span> while you have an attached process, you detach
that process.  If you use the <code>run</code> command, you kill that process. 
By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> asks for confirmation if you try to do either of these
things; you can control whether or not you need to confirm by using the
<code>set confirm</code> command (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and Messages</a>).

<dl><dt><code>kill</code><dd>Kill the child process in which your program is running under <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
</dl>

   <p>This command is useful if you wish to debug a core dump instead of a
running process.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> ignores any core dump file while your program
is running.

   <p>On some operating systems, a program cannot be executed outside <span class="sc">gdb</span>
while you have breakpoints set on it inside <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  You can use the
<code>kill</code> command in this situation to permit running your program
outside the debugger.

   <p>The <code>kill</code> command is also useful if you wish to recompile and
relink your program, since on many systems it is impossible to modify an
executable file while it is running in a process.  In this case, when you
next type <code>run</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices that the file has changed, and
reads the symbol table again (while trying to preserve your current
breakpoint settings).

<h3 class="section">4.9 Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single
session.  In addition, <span class="sc">gdb</span> on some systems may let you run
several programs simultaneously (otherwise you have to exit from one
before starting another).  In the most general case, you can have
multiple threads of execution in each of multiple processes, launched
from multiple executables.

   <p><a name="index-inferior-151"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> represents the state of each program execution with an
object called an <dfn>inferior</dfn>.  An inferior typically corresponds to
a process, but is more general and applies also to targets that do not
have processes.  Inferiors may be created before a process runs, and
may be retained after a process exits.  Inferiors have unique
identifiers that are different from process ids.  Usually each
inferior will also have its own distinct address space, although some
embedded targets may have several inferiors running in different parts
of a single address space.  Each inferior may in turn have multiple
threads running in it.

   <p>To find out what inferiors exist at any moment, use <code>info&nbsp;inferiors</code><!-- /@w -->:

     
<a name="index-info-inferiors-152"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info inferiors</code><dd>Print a list of all inferiors currently being managed by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each inferior (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the inferior number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the target system's inferior identifier

          <li>the name of the executable the inferior is running.

          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; preceding the <span class="sc">gdb</span> inferior number
indicates the current inferior.

     <p>For example,
</dl>
   <!-- end table here to get a little more width for example -->

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info inferiors
       Num  Description       Executable
       2    process 2307      hello
     * 1    process 3401      goodbye
</pre>
   <p>To switch focus between inferiors, use the <code>inferior</code> command:

     
<a name="index-inferior-_0040var_007binfno_007d-153"></a>
<dl><dt><code>inferior </code><var>infno</var><dd>Make inferior number <var>infno</var> the current inferior.  The argument
<var>infno</var> is the inferior number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, as shown
in the first field of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info inferiors</span></samp>&rsquo; display. 
</dl>

   <p>You can get multiple executables into a debugging session via the
<code>add-inferior</code> and <code>clone-inferior</code><!-- /@w --> commands.  On some
systems <span class="sc">gdb</span> can add inferiors to the debug session
automatically by following calls to <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>.  To
remove inferiors from the debugging session use the
<code>remove-inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command.

     
<a name="index-add_002dinferior-154"></a>
<dl><dt><code>add-inferior [ -copies </code><var>n</var><code> ] [ -exec </code><var>executable</var><code> ]</code><dd>Adds <var>n</var> inferiors to be run using <var>executable</var> as the
executable; <var>n</var> defaults to 1.  If no executable is specified,
the inferiors begins empty, with no program.  You can still assign or
change the program assigned to the inferior at any time by using the
<code>file</code> command with the executable name as its argument.

     <p><a name="index-clone_002dinferior-155"></a><br><dt><code>clone-inferior [ -copies </code><var>n</var><code> ] [ </code><var>infno</var><code> ]</code><dd>Adds <var>n</var> inferiors ready to execute the same program as inferior
<var>infno</var>; <var>n</var> defaults to 1, and <var>infno</var> defaults to the
number of the current inferior.  This is a convenient command when you
want to run another instance of the inferior you are debugging.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info inferiors
            Num  Description       Executable

          * 1    process 29964     helloworld
</pre>
     <p>You can now simply switch focus to inferior 2 and run it.

     <p><a name="index-remove_002dinferiors-156"></a><br><dt><code>remove-inferiors </code><var>infno</var><code>...</code><dd>Removes the inferior or inferiors <var>infno</var><small class="dots">...</small>.  It is not
possible to remove an inferior that is running with this command.  For
those, use the <code>kill</code> or <code>detach</code> command first.

   </dl>

   <p>To quit debugging one of the running inferiors that is not the current
inferior, you can either detach from it by using the <code>detach&nbsp;inferior</code><!-- /@w --> command (allowing it to run independently), or kill it
using the <code>kill&nbsp;inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command:

     
<a name="index-detach-inferiors-_0040var_007binfno_007d_0040dots_007b_007d-157"></a>
<dl><dt><code>detach inferior </code><var>infno</var><code>...</code><dd>Detach from the inferior or inferiors identified by <span class="sc">gdb</span>
inferior number(s) <var>infno</var><small class="dots">...</small>.  Note that the inferior's entry
still stays on the list of inferiors shown by <code>info inferiors</code>,
but its Description will show &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;null&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><a name="index-kill-inferiors-_0040var_007binfno_007d_0040dots_007b_007d-158"></a><br><dt><code>kill inferiors </code><var>infno</var><code>...</code><dd>Kill the inferior or inferiors identified by <span class="sc">gdb</span> inferior
number(s) <var>infno</var><small class="dots">...</small>.  Note that the inferior's entry still
stays on the list of inferiors shown by <code>info inferiors</code>, but its
Description will show &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;null&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

   <p>After the successful completion of a command such as <code>detach</code>,
<code>detach inferiors</code>, <code>kill</code> or <code>kill inferiors</code>, or after
a normal process exit, the inferior is still valid and listed with
<code>info inferiors</code>, ready to be restarted.

   <p>To be notified when inferiors are started or exit under <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
control use <code>set&nbsp;print&nbsp;inferior-events</code><!-- /@w -->:

     
<a name="index-set-print-inferior_002devents-159"></a>
<a name="index-print-messages-on-inferior-start-and-exit-160"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set print inferior-events</code><dt><code>set print inferior-events on</code><dt><code>set print inferior-events off</code><dd>The <code>set print inferior-events</code> command allows you to enable or
disable printing of messages when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices that new
inferiors have started or that inferiors have exited or have been
detached.  By default, these messages will not be printed.

     <p><a name="index-show-print-inferior_002devents-161"></a><br><dt><code>show print inferior-events</code><dd>Show whether messages will be printed when <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects that
inferiors have started, exited or have been detached. 
</dl>

   <p>Many commands will work the same with multiple programs as with a
single program: e.g., <code>print myglobal</code> will simply display the
value of <code>myglobal</code> in the current inferior.

   <p>Occasionaly, when debugging <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself, it may be useful to
get more info about the relationship of inferiors, programs, address
spaces in a debug session.  You can do that with the <code>maint&nbsp;info&nbsp;program-spaces</code><!-- /@w --> command.

     
<a name="index-maint-info-program_002dspaces-162"></a>
<dl><dt><code>maint info program-spaces</code><dd>Print a list of all program spaces currently being managed by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each program space (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the program space number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the name of the executable loaded into the program space, with e.g.,
the <code>file</code> command.

          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; preceding the <span class="sc">gdb</span> program space number
indicates the current program space.

     <p>In addition, below each program space line, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints extra
information that isn't suitable to display in tabular form.  For
example, the list of inferiors bound to the program space.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) maint info program-spaces
            Id   Executable
            2    goodbye
                  Bound inferiors: ID 1 (process 21561)
          * 1    hello
</pre>
     <p>Here we can see that no inferior is running the program <code>hello</code>,
while <code>process 21561</code> is running the program <code>goodbye</code>.  On
some targets, it is possible that multiple inferiors are bound to the
same program space.  The most common example is that of debugging both
the parent and child processes of a <code>vfork</code> call.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) maint info program-spaces
            Id   Executable
          * 1    vfork-test
                  Bound inferiors: ID 2 (process 18050), ID 1 (process 18045)
</pre>
     <p>Here, both inferior 2 and inferior 1 are running in the same program
space as a result of inferior 1 having executed a <code>vfork</code> call.

<p><a name="index-threads-of-execution-163"></a><a name="index-multiple-threads-164"></a><a name="index-switching-threads-165"></a>In some operating systems, such as HP-UX and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one <dfn>thread</dfn> of execution.  The precise semantics
of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general
the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes&mdash;except
that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and
modify the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:

     <ul>
<li>automatic notification of new threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>&rsquo;, a command to switch among threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo;, a command to inquire about existing threads
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread apply [</span><var>threadno</var><span class="samp">] [</span><var>all</var><span class="samp">] </span><var>args</var></samp>&rsquo;,
a command to apply a command to a list of threads
<li>thread-specific breakpoints
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print thread-events</span></samp>&rsquo;, which controls printing of
messages on thread start and exit. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set libthread-db-search-path </span><var>path</var></samp>&rsquo;, which lets
the user specify which <code>libthread_db</code> to use if the default choice
isn't compatible with the program. 
</ul>

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> These facilities are not yet available on every
<span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration where the operating system supports threads. 
If your <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not support threads, these commands have no
effect.  For example, a system without thread support shows no output
from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo;, and always rejects the <code>thread</code> command,
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
     (gdb) thread 1
     Thread ID 1 not known.  Use the "info threads" command to
     see the IDs of currently known threads.
</pre>
   <!-- FIXME to implementors: how hard would it be to say "sorry, this GDB -->
<!-- doesn't support threads"? -->
   </blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-focus-of-debugging-166"></a><a name="index-current-thread-167"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs&mdash;but whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging. 
This thread is called the <dfn>current thread</dfn>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bNew_007d-_0040var_007bsystag_007d-message-168"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029-169"></a><!-- FIXME-implementors!! It would be more helpful if the [New...] message -->
<!-- included GDB's numeric thread handle, so you could just go to that -->
<!-- thread without first checking `info threads'. -->
Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[New </span><var>systag</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
<span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, you might see

<pre class="smallexample">     [New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices a new thread.  In contrast, on an SGI system,
the <var>systag</var> is simply something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process 368</span></samp>&rsquo;, with no
further qualifier.

<!-- FIXME!! (1) Does the [New...] message appear even for the very first -->
<!-- thread of a program, or does it only appear for the -->
<!-- second-i.e.@: when it becomes obvious we have a multithread -->
<!-- program? -->
<!-- (2) *Is* there necessarily a first thread always?  Or do some -->
<!-- multithread systems permit starting a program with multiple -->
<!-- threads ab initio? -->
   <p><a name="index-thread-number-170"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029-171"></a>For debugging purposes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> associates its own thread
number&mdash;always a single integer&mdash;with each thread in your program.

     
<a name="index-info-threads-172"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info threads </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>id</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Display a summary of all threads currently in your program.  Optional
argument <var>id</var><small class="dots">...</small> is one or more thread ids separated by spaces, and
means to print information only about the specified thread or threads. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each thread (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the thread number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the target system's thread identifier (<var>systag</var>)

          <li>the thread's name, if one is known.  A thread can either be named by
the user (see <code>thread name</code>, below), or, in some cases, by the
program itself.

          <li>the current stack frame summary for that thread
          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to the left of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number
indicates the current thread.

     <p>For example,
</dl>
   <!-- end table here to get a little more width for example -->

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
       Id   Target Id         Frame

     * 1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
         at threadtest.c:68
</pre>
   <p>On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with a
Solaris-specific command:

     <dl>
<dt><code>maint info sol-threads</code><dd><a name="index-maint-info-sol_002dthreads-173"></a><a name="index-thread-info-_0028Solaris_0029-174"></a>Display info on Solaris user threads.

<dl><dt><code>thread </code><var>threadno</var><dd>Make thread number <var>threadno</var> the current thread.  The command
argument <var>threadno</var> is the internal <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number, as
shown in the first field of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo; display. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> responds by displaying the system identifier of the thread
you selected, and its current stack frame summary:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) thread 2
          [Switching to thread 2 (Thread 0xb7fdab70 (LWP 12747))]

</pre>
     <p class="noindent">As with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[New ...]</span></samp>&rsquo; message, the form of the text after
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Switching to</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on your system's conventions for identifying
threads.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fthread_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-176"></a>The debugger convenience variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$_thread</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the number
of the current thread.  You may find this useful in writing breakpoint
conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth.  See

information on convenience variables.

<var>command</var> to one or more threads.  Specify the numbers of the
threads that you want affected with the command argument
<var>threadno</var>.  It can be a single thread number, one of the numbers
shown in the first field of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo; display; or it
could be a range of thread numbers, as in <code>2-4</code>.  To apply
a command to all threads in descending order, type <kbd>thread apply all

     <p>On some systems, such as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to
determine the name of the thread as given by the OS.  On these
systems, a name specified with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>&rsquo; will override the
system-give name, and removing the user-specified name will cause
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to once again display the system-specified name.

     <p>As well as being the complement to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>&rsquo; command,
this command also allows you to identify a thread by its target

Internally, the default value comes from the <code>LIBTHREAD_DB_SEARCH_PATH</code>

<h3 class="section">4.11 Debugging Forks</h3>

<p><a name="index-fork_002c-debugging-programs-which-call-192"></a><a name="index-multiple-processes-193"></a><a name="index-processes_002c-multiple-194"></a>On most systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has no special support for debugging
programs which create additional processes using the <code>fork</code>
function.  When a program forks, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will continue to debug the
parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.  If you have
set a breakpoint in any code which the child then executes, the child
will get a <code>SIGTRAP</code> signal which (unless it catches the signal)
will cause it to terminate.

   <p>However, if you want to debug the child process there is a workaround
which isn't too painful.  Put a call to <code>sleep</code> in the code which
the child process executes after the fork.  It may be useful to sleep
only if a certain environment variable is set, or a certain file exists,
so that the delay need not occur when you don't want to run <span class="sc">gdb</span>
on the child.  While the child is sleeping, use the <code>ps</code> program to
get its process ID.  Then tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> (a new invocation of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> if you are also debugging the parent process) to attach to
the child process (see <a href="#Attach">Attach</a>).  From that point on you can debug
the child process just like any other process which you attached to.

   <p>On some systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides support for debugging programs that
create additional processes using the <code>fork</code> or <code>vfork</code> functions. 
Currently, the only platforms with this feature are HP-UX (11.x and later
only?) and <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux (kernel version 2.5.60 and later).

   <p>The fork debugging commands are supported in both native mode and when
connected to <code>gdbserver</code> using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>.

   <p>By default, when a program forks, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will continue to debug
the parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.

   <p>If you want to follow the child process instead of the parent process,
use the command <code>set&nbsp;follow-fork-mode</code><!-- /@w -->.

     
<a name="index-set-follow_002dfork_002dmode-195"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set follow-fork-mode </code><var>mode</var><dd>Set the debugger response to a program call of <code>fork</code> or
<code>vfork</code>.  A call to <code>fork</code> or <code>vfork</code> creates a new
process.  The <var>mode</var> argument can be:

          <dl>
<dt><code>parent</code><dd>The original process is debugged after a fork.  The child process runs
unimpeded.  This is the default.

          <br><dt><code>child</code><dd>The new process is debugged after a fork.  The parent process runs
unimpeded.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-debugging-multiple-processes-197"></a>On Linux, if you want to debug both the parent and child processes, use the
command <code>set&nbsp;detach-on-fork</code><!-- /@w -->.

     
<a name="index-set-detach_002don_002dfork-198"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set detach-on-fork </code><var>mode</var><dd>Tells gdb whether to detach one of the processes after a fork, or
retain debugger control over them both.

          <dl>
<dt><code>on</code><dd>The child process (or parent process, depending on the value of
<code>follow-fork-mode</code>) will be detached and allowed to run
independently.  This is the default.

          <br><dt><code>off</code><dd>Both processes will be held under the control of <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
One process (child or parent, depending on the value of
<code>follow-fork-mode</code>) is debugged as usual, while the other
is held suspended.

     </dl>

     <p><a name="index-show-detach_002don_002dfork-199"></a><br><dt><code>show detach-on-fork</code><dd>Show whether detach-on-fork mode is on/off. 
</dl>

   <p>If you choose to set &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">detach-on-fork</span></samp>&rsquo; mode off, then <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will retain control of all forked processes (including nested forks). 
You can list the forked processes under the control of <span class="sc">gdb</span> by
using the <code>info&nbsp;inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command, and switch from one fork
to another by using the <code>inferior</code> command (see <a href="#Inferiors-and-Programs">Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs</a>).

   <p>To quit debugging one of the forked processes, you can either detach
from it by using the <code>detach&nbsp;inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command (allowing it
to run independently), or kill it using the <code>kill&nbsp;inferiors</code><!-- /@w -->
command.  See <a href="#Inferiors-and-Programs">Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs</a>.

   <p>If you ask to debug a child process and a <code>vfork</code> is followed by an
<code>exec</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> executes the new target up to the first
breakpoint in the new target.  If you have a breakpoint set on
<code>main</code> in your original program, the breakpoint will also be set on
the child process's <code>main</code>.

   <p>On some systems, when a child process is spawned by <code>vfork</code>, you
cannot debug the child or parent until an <code>exec</code> call completes.

   <p>If you issue a <code>run</code> command to <span class="sc">gdb</span> after an <code>exec</code>
call executes, the new target restarts.  To restart the parent
process, use the <code>file</code> command with the parent executable name
as its argument.  By default, after an <code>exec</code> call executes,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> discards the symbols of the previous executable image. 
You can change this behaviour with the <code>set&nbsp;follow-exec-mode</code><!-- /@w -->
command.

     
<a name="index-set-follow_002dexec_002dmode-200"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set follow-exec-mode </code><var>mode</var><dd>
Set debugger response to a program call of <code>exec</code>.  An
<code>exec</code> call replaces the program image of a process.

     <p><code>follow-exec-mode</code> can be:

          <dl>
<dt><code>new</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> creates a new inferior and rebinds the process to this
new inferior.  The program the process was running before the
<code>exec</code> call can be restarted afterwards by restarting the
original inferior.

          <p>For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) info inferiors
               (gdb) info inferior
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
               (gdb) run
               process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 2    &lt;null&gt;        prog2
                 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>same</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> keeps the process bound to the same inferior.  The new
executable image replaces the previous executable loaded in the
inferior.  Restarting the inferior after the <code>exec</code> call, with
e.g., the <code>run</code> command, restarts the executable the process was
running after the <code>exec</code> call.  This is the default mode.

          <p>For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog1
               (gdb) run
               process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    &lt;null&gt;        prog2
</pre>
          </dl>
     </dl>

   <p>You can use the <code>catch</code> command to make <span class="sc">gdb</span> stop whenever
a <code>fork</code>, <code>vfork</code>, or <code>exec</code> call is made.  See <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Setting Catchpoints</a>.

<p><a name="index-checkpoint-201"></a><a name="index-restart-202"></a><a name="index-bookmark-203"></a><a name="index-snapshot-of-a-process-204"></a><a name="index-rewind-program-state-205"></a>
On certain operating systems<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to save a <dfn>snapshot</dfn> of a
program's state, called a <dfn>checkpoint</dfn>, and come back to it
later.

   <p>Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has
happened in the program since the <code>checkpoint</code> was saved.  This
includes changes in memory, registers, and even (within some limits)
system state.  Effectively, it is like going back in time to the
moment when the checkpoint was saved.

   <p>Thus, if you're stepping thru a program and you think you're
getting close to the point where things go wrong, you can save
a checkpoint.  Then, if you accidentally go too far and miss
the critical statement, instead of having to restart your program
from the beginning, you can just go back to the checkpoint and
start again from there.

   <p>This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or
steps to reach the point where you think the bug occurs.

   <p>To use the <code>checkpoint</code>/<code>restart</code> method of debugging:

     
<a name="index-checkpoint-206"></a>
<dl><dt><code>checkpoint</code><dd>Save a snapshot of the debugged program's current execution state. 
The <code>checkpoint</code> command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint
is assigned a small integer id, similar to a breakpoint id.

     <p><a name="index-info-checkpoints-207"></a><br><dt><code>info checkpoints</code><dd>List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging
session.  For each checkpoint, the following information will be
listed:

          <dl>
<dt><code>Checkpoint ID</code><br><dt><code>Process ID</code><br><dt><code>Code Address</code><br><dt><code>Source line, or label</code><dd></dl>

     <p><a name="index-restart-_0040var_007bcheckpoint_002did_007d-208"></a><br><dt><code>restart </code><var>checkpoint-id</var><dd>Restore the program state that was saved as checkpoint number
<var>checkpoint-id</var>.  All program variables, registers, stack frames
etc.  will be returned to the values that they had when the checkpoint
was saved.  In essence, gdb will &ldquo;wind back the clock&rdquo; to the point
in time when the checkpoint was saved.

     <p>Note that breakpoints, <span class="sc">gdb</span> variables, command history etc. 
are not affected by restoring a checkpoint.  In general, a checkpoint
only restores things that reside in the program being debugged, not in
the debugger.

     <p><a name="index-delete-checkpoint-_0040var_007bcheckpoint_002did_007d-209"></a><br><dt><code>delete checkpoint </code><var>checkpoint-id</var><dd>Delete the previously-saved checkpoint identified by <var>checkpoint-id</var>.

   </dl>

   <p>Returning to a previously saved checkpoint will restore the user state
of the program being debugged, plus a significant subset of the system
(OS) state, including file pointers.  It won't &ldquo;un-write&rdquo; data from
a file, but it will rewind the file pointer to the previous location,
so that the previously written data can be overwritten.  For files
opened in read mode, the pointer will also be restored so that the
previously read data can be read again.

   <p>Of course, characters that have been sent to a printer (or other
external device) cannot be &ldquo;snatched back&rdquo;, and characters received
from eg. a serial device can be removed from internal program buffers,
but they cannot be &ldquo;pushed back&rdquo; into the serial pipeline, ready to
be received again.  Similarly, the actual contents of files that have
been changed cannot be restored (at this time).

   <p>However, within those constraints, you actually can &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; your
program to a previously saved point in time, and begin debugging it
again &mdash; and you can change the course of events so as to debug a
different execution path this time.

   <p><a name="index-checkpoints-and-process-id-210"></a>Finally, there is one bit of internal program state that will be
different when you return to a checkpoint &mdash; the program's process
id.  Each checkpoint will have a unique process id (or <var>pid</var>),
and each will be different from the program's original <var>pid</var>. 
If your program has saved a local copy of its process id, this could
potentially pose a problem.

<h4 class="subsection">4.12.1 A Non-obvious Benefit of Using Checkpoints</h4>

<p>On some systems such as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, address space randomization
is performed on new processes for security reasons.  This makes it
difficult or impossible to set a breakpoint, or watchpoint, on an
absolute address if you have to restart the program, since the
absolute location of a symbol will change from one execution to the
next.

   <p>A checkpoint, however, is an <em>identical</em> copy of a process. 
Therefore if you create a checkpoint at (eg.) the start of main,
and simply return to that checkpoint instead of restarting the
process, you can avoid the effects of address randomization and
your symbols will all stay in the same place.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Stopping and Continuing</h2>

<p>The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your
program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into
trouble, you can investigate and find out why.

   <p>Inside <span class="sc">gdb</span>, your program may stop for any of several reasons,
such as a signal, a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a
<span class="sc">gdb</span> command such as <code>step</code>.  You may then examine and
change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and then
continue execution.  Usually, the messages shown by <span class="sc">gdb</span> provide
ample explanation of the status of your program&mdash;but you can also
explicitly request this information at any time.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Breakpoints, Watchpoints, and Catchpoints</h3>

<p><a name="index-breakpoints-212"></a>A <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> makes your program stop whenever a certain point in
the program is reached.  For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to
control in finer detail whether your program stops.  You can set
breakpoints with the <code>break</code> command and its variants (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>), to specify the place where your program
should stop by line number, function name or exact address in the
program.

   <p>On some systems, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries before
the executable is run.  There is a minor limitation on HP-UX systems:
you must wait until the executable is run in order to set breakpoints
in shared library routines that are not called directly by the program
(for example, routines that are arguments in a <code>pthread_create</code>
call).

   <p><a name="index-watchpoints-213"></a><a name="index-data-breakpoints-214"></a><a name="index-memory-tracing-215"></a><a name="index-breakpoint-on-memory-address-216"></a><a name="index-breakpoint-on-variable-modification-217"></a>A <dfn>watchpoint</dfn> is a special breakpoint that stops your program
when the value of an expression changes.  The expression may be a value
of a variable, or it could involve values of one or more variables
combined by operators, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is sometimes called
<dfn>data breakpoints</dfn>.  You must use a different command to set
watchpoints (see <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Setting Watchpoints</a>), but aside
from that, you can manage a watchpoint like any other breakpoint: you
enable, disable, and delete both breakpoints and watchpoints using the
same commands.

   <p>You can arrange to have values from your program displayed automatically
whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops at a breakpoint.  See <a href="#Auto-Display">Automatic Display</a>.

   <p><a name="index-catchpoints-218"></a><a name="index-breakpoint-on-events-219"></a>A <dfn>catchpoint</dfn> is another special breakpoint that stops your program
when a certain kind of event occurs, such as the throwing of a C<tt>++</tt>
exception or the loading of a library.  As with watchpoints, you use a
different command to set a catchpoint (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Setting Catchpoints</a>), but aside from that, you can manage a catchpoint like any
other breakpoint.  (To stop when your program receives a signal, use the
<code>handle</code> command; see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-breakpoint-numbers-220"></a><a name="index-numbers-for-breakpoints-221"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> assigns a number to each breakpoint, watchpoint, or
catchpoint when you create it; these numbers are successive integers
starting with one.  In many of the commands for controlling various
features of breakpoints you use the breakpoint number to say which
breakpoint you want to change.  Each breakpoint may be <dfn>enabled</dfn> or
<dfn>disabled</dfn>; if disabled, it has no effect on your program until you
enable it again.

   <p><a name="index-breakpoint-ranges-222"></a><a name="index-ranges-of-breakpoints-223"></a>Some <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands accept a range of breakpoints on which to
operate.  A breakpoint range is either a single breakpoint number, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5</span></samp>&rsquo;, or two such numbers, in increasing order, separated by a
hyphen, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5-7</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When a breakpoint range is given to a command,
all breakpoints in that range are operated on.

<p><a name="index-break-224"></a><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007bbreak_007d_0029_007d-225"></a><a name="index-g_t_0024bpnum_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-226"></a><a name="index-latest-breakpoint-227"></a>Breakpoints are set with the <code>break</code> command (abbreviated
<code>b</code>).  The debugger convenience variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$bpnum</span></samp>&rsquo; records the
number of the breakpoint you've set most recently; see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for a discussion of what you can do with
convenience variables.

     <dl>
<dt><code>break </code><var>location</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at the given <var>location</var>, which can specify a
function name, a line number, or an address of an instruction. 
(See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for a list of all the possible ways to
specify a <var>location</var>.)  The breakpoint will stop your program just
before it executes any of the code in the specified <var>location</var>.

     <p>When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as
C<tt>++</tt>, a function name may refer to more than one possible place to break. 
See <a href="#Ambiguous-Expressions">Ambiguous Expressions</a>, for a discussion of
that situation.

     <p>It is also possible to insert a breakpoint that will stop the program
only if a specific thread (see <a href="#Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints">Thread-Specific Breakpoints</a>)
or a specific task (see <a href="#Ada-Tasks">Ada Tasks</a>) hits that breakpoint.

     <br><dt><code>break</code><dd>When called without any arguments, <code>break</code> sets a breakpoint at
the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Stack">Examining the Stack</a>).  In any selected frame but the
innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control
returns to that frame.  This is similar to the effect of a
<code>finish</code> command in the frame inside the selected frame&mdash;except
that <code>finish</code> does not leave an active breakpoint.  If you use
<code>break</code> without an argument in the innermost frame, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops
the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful
inside loops.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at
least one instruction has been executed.  If it did not do this, you
would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the
breakpoint.  This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already
existed when your program stopped.

     <br><dt><code>break ... if </code><var>cond</var><dd>Set a breakpoint with condition <var>cond</var>; evaluate the expression
<var>cond</var> each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the
value is nonzero&mdash;that is, if <var>cond</var> evaluates as true. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for one of the possible arguments described
above (or no argument) specifying where to break.  See <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>, for more information on breakpoint conditions.

     <p><a name="index-tbreak-228"></a><br><dt><code>tbreak </code><var>args</var><dd>Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  The <var>args</var> are the
same as for the <code>break</code> command, and the breakpoint is set in the same
way, but the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first time your
program stops there.  See <a href="#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>.

     <p><a name="index-hbreak-229"></a><a name="index-hardware-breakpoints-230"></a><br><dt><code>hbreak </code><var>args</var><dd>Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint.  The <var>args</var> are the same as for the
<code>break</code> command and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but the
breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware may not
have this support.  The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM code
debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction without
changing the instruction.  This can be used with the new trap-generation
provided by SPARClite DSU and most x86-based targets.  These targets
will generate traps when a program accesses some data or instruction
address that is assigned to the debug registers.  However the hardware
breakpoint registers can take a limited number of breakpoints.  For
example, on the DSU, only two data breakpoints can be set at a time, and
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will reject this command if more than two are used.  Delete
or disable unused hardware breakpoints before setting new ones
(see <a href="#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>). 
See <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>. 
For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware
breakpoints <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use, see <a href="#set-remote-hardware_002dbreakpoint_002dlimit">set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit</a>.

command, the breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware

breakpoints are set, they are treated just like the breakpoints set with
the <code>break</code> command.  You can delete them, disable them, or make
them conditional the same way as any other breakpoint.

     <p>The syntax of the regular expression is the standard one used with tools
like <samp><span class="file">grep</span></samp>.  Note that this is different from the syntax used by
shells, so for instance <code>foo*</code> matches all functions that include
an <code>fo</code> followed by zero or more <code>o</code>s.  There is an implicit
<code>.*</code> leading and trailing the regular expression you supply, so to
match only functions that begin with <code>foo</code>, use <code>^foo</code>.

     <p><a name="index-non_002dmember-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-functions_002c-set-breakpoint-in-236"></a>When debugging C<tt>++</tt> programs, <code>rbreak</code> is useful for setting
breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any special

     <p><a name="index-set-breakpoints-on-all-functions-237"></a>The <code>rbreak</code> command can be used to set breakpoints in
<strong>all</strong> the functions in a program, like this:

     <br><dt><code>rbreak </code><var>file</var><code>:</code><var>regex</var><dd>If <code>rbreak</code> is called with a filename qualification, it limits
the search for functions matching the given regular expression to the

every function in a given file:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) rbreak file.c:.
</pre>
     <p>The colon separating the filename qualifier from the regex may
optionally be surrounded by spaces.

not deleted.  Optional argument <var>n</var> means print information only
about the specified breakpoint(s) (or watchpoint(s) or catchpoint(s)). 
For each breakpoint, following columns are printed:

          <dl>
<dt><em>Breakpoint Numbers</em><br><dt><em>Type</em><dd>Breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint. 
<br><dt><em>Disposition</em><dd>Whether the breakpoint is marked to be disabled or deleted when hit. 
<br><dt><em>Enabled or Disabled</em><dd>Enabled breakpoints are marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; marks breakpoints
that are not enabled. 
<br><dt><em>Address</em><dd>Where the breakpoint is in your program, as a memory address.  For a
pending breakpoint whose address is not yet known, this field will
contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;PENDING&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Such breakpoint won't fire until a shared
library that has the symbol or line referred by breakpoint is loaded. 
See below for details.  A breakpoint with several locations will
have &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in this field&mdash;see below for details. 
<br><dt><em>What</em><dd>Where the breakpoint is in the source for your program, as a file and
line number.  For a pending breakpoint, the original string passed to
the breakpoint command will be listed as it cannot be resolved until
the appropriate shared library is loaded in the future. 
</dl>

     <p class="noindent">If a breakpoint is conditional, there are two evaluation modes: &ldquo;host&rdquo; and
&ldquo;target&rdquo;.  If mode is &ldquo;host&rdquo;, breakpoint condition evaluation is done by
<span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host's side.  If it is &ldquo;target&rdquo;, then the condition
is evaluated by the target.  The <code>info break</code> command shows
the condition on the line following the affected breakpoint, together with
its condition evaluation mode in between parentheses.

     <p>Breakpoint commands, if any, are listed after that.  A pending breakpoint is
allowed to have a condition specified for it.  The condition is not parsed for
validity until a shared library is loaded that allows the pending
breakpoint to resolve to a valid location.

     <p class="noindent"><code>info break</code> with a breakpoint
number <var>n</var> as argument lists only that breakpoint.  The
convenience variable <code>$_</code> and the default examining-address for
the <code>x</code> command are set to the address of the last breakpoint
listed (see <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>).

     <p class="noindent"><code>info break</code> displays a count of the number of times the breakpoint
has been hit.  This is especially useful in conjunction with the
<code>ignore</code> command.  You can ignore a large number of breakpoint
hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the breakpoint
was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that number.  This
will get you quickly to the last hit of that breakpoint.

     <p class="noindent">For a breakpoints with an enable count (xref) greater than 1,
<code>info break</code> also displays that count.

   </dl>

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in
your program.  There is nothing silly or meaningless about this.  When
the breakpoints are conditional, this is even useful
(see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>).

   <p><a name="index-multiple-locations_002c-breakpoints-240"></a><a name="index-breakpoints_002c-multiple-locations-241"></a>It is possible that a breakpoint corresponds to several locations
in your program.  Examples of this situation are:

     <ul>
<li>Multiple functions in the program may have the same name.

     <li>For a C<tt>++</tt> constructor, the <span class="sc">gcc</span> compiler generates several
instances of the function body, used in different cases.

     <li>For a C<tt>++</tt> template function, a given line in the function can
correspond to any number of instantiations.

     <li>For an inlined function, a given source line can correspond to
several places where that function is inlined. 
</ul>

   <p>In all those cases, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will insert a breakpoint at all
the relevant locations.

   <p>A breakpoint with multiple locations is displayed in the breakpoint
table using several rows&mdash;one header row, followed by one row for
each breakpoint location.  The header row has &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
address column.  The rows for individual locations contain the actual
addresses for locations, and show the functions to which those
locations belong.  The number column for a location is of the form
<var>breakpoint-number</var>.<var>location-number</var>.

   <p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     Num     Type           Disp Enb  Address    What
     1       breakpoint     keep y    &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
             stop only if i==1
             breakpoint already hit 1 time
     1.1                         y    0x080486a2 in void foo&lt;int&gt;() at t.cc:8
     1.2                         y    0x080486ca in void foo&lt;double&gt;() at t.cc:8
</pre>
   <p>Each location can be individually enabled or disabled by passing
<var>breakpoint-number</var>.<var>location-number</var> as argument to the
<code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands.  It's also possible to
<code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> range of <var>location-number</var>
breakpoints using a <var>breakpoint-number</var> and two <var>location-number</var>,
in increasing order, separated by a hyphen, like
‘<var>breakpoint-number</var>.5-7’. 
In this case, when a <var>location-number</var> range is given to this
command, all breakpoints belonging to this <var>breakpoint-number</var>
and inside that range are operated on. 
Note that you cannot delete the individual locations from the list,
you can only delete the entire list of locations that belong to their
parent breakpoint (with the <kbd>delete </kbd><var>num</var> command, where
<var>num</var> is the number of the parent breakpoint, 1 in the above example). 
Disabling or enabling the parent breakpoint (see <a href="#Disabling">Disabling</a>) affects
all of the locations that belong to that breakpoint.

   <p><a name="index-pending-breakpoints-242"></a>It's quite common to have a breakpoint inside a shared library. 
Shared libraries can be loaded and unloaded explicitly,
and possibly repeatedly, as the program is executed.  To support
this use case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> updates breakpoint locations whenever
any shared library is loaded or unloaded.  Typically, you would
set a breakpoint in a shared library at the beginning of your
debugging session, when the library is not loaded, and when the
symbols from the library are not available.  When you try to set
breakpoint, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will ask you if you want to set
a so called <dfn>pending breakpoint</dfn>&mdash;breakpoint whose address
is not yet resolved.

   <p>After the program is run, whenever a new shared library is loaded,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> reevaluates all the breakpoints.  When a newly loaded
shared library contains the symbol or line referred to by some
pending breakpoint, that breakpoint is resolved and becomes an
ordinary breakpoint.  When a library is unloaded, all breakpoints
that refer to its symbols or source lines become pending again.

   <p>This logic works for breakpoints with multiple locations, too.  For
example, if you have a breakpoint in a C<tt>++</tt> template function, and
a newly loaded shared library has an instantiation of that template,
a new location is added to the list of locations for the breakpoint.

   <p>Except for having unresolved address, pending breakpoints do not
differ from regular breakpoints.  You can set conditions or commands,
enable and disable them and perform other breakpoint operations.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides some additional commands for controlling what
happens when the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">break</span></samp>&rsquo; command cannot resolve breakpoint
address specification to an address:

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-pending-243"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-pending-244"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint pending auto</code><dd>This is the default behavior.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot find the breakpoint
location, it queries you whether a pending breakpoint should be created.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint pending on</code><dd>This indicates that an unrecognized breakpoint location should automatically
result in a pending breakpoint being created.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint pending off</code><dd>This indicates that pending breakpoints are not to be created.  Any
unrecognized breakpoint location results in an error.  This setting does
not affect any pending breakpoints previously created.

     <br><dt><code>show breakpoint pending</code><dd>Show the current behavior setting for creating pending breakpoints. 
</dl>

   <p>The settings above only affect the <code>break</code> command and its
variants.  Once breakpoint is set, it will be automatically updated
as shared libraries are loaded and unloaded.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-hardware-breakpoints-245"></a>For some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can automatically decide if hardware or
software breakpoints should be used, depending on whether the
breakpoint address is read-only or read-write.  This applies to
breakpoints set with the <code>break</code> command as well as to internal
breakpoints set by commands like <code>next</code> and <code>finish</code>.  For
breakpoints set with <code>hbreak</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will always use hardware
breakpoints.

   <p>You can control this automatic behaviour with the following commands::

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-auto_002dhw-246"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-auto_002dhw-247"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint auto-hw on</code><dd>This is the default behavior.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> sets a breakpoint, it
will try to use the target memory map to decide if software or hardware
breakpoint must be used.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint auto-hw off</code><dd>This indicates <span class="sc">gdb</span> should not automatically select breakpoint
type.  If the target provides a memory map, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will warn when
trying to set software breakpoint at a read-only address. 
</dl>

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> normally implements breakpoints by replacing the program code
at the breakpoint address with a special instruction, which, when
executed, given control to the debugger.  By default, the program
code is so modified only when the program is resumed.  As soon as
the program stops, <span class="sc">gdb</span> restores the original instructions.  This
behaviour guards against leaving breakpoints inserted in the
target should gdb abrubptly disconnect.  However, with slow remote
targets, inserting and removing breakpoint can reduce the performance. 
This behavior can be controlled with the following commands::

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-always_002dinserted-248"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-always_002dinserted-249"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint always-inserted off</code><dd>All breakpoints, including newly added by the user, are inserted in
the target only when the target is resumed.  All breakpoints are
removed from the target when it stops.  This is the default mode.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint always-inserted on</code><dd>Causes all breakpoints to be inserted in the target at all times.  If
the user adds a new breakpoint, or changes an existing breakpoint, the
breakpoints in the target are updated immediately.  A breakpoint is
removed from the target only when breakpoint itself is deleted. 
</dl>

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> handles conditional breakpoints by evaluating these conditions
when a breakpoint breaks.  If the condition is true, then the process being
debugged stops, otherwise the process is resumed.

   <p>If the target supports evaluating conditions on its end, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may
download the breakpoint, together with its conditions, to it.

   <p>This feature can be controlled via the following commands:

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-condition_002devaluation-250"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-condition_002devaluation-251"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint condition-evaluation host</code><dd>This option commands <span class="sc">gdb</span> to evaluate the breakpoint
conditions on the host's side.  Unconditional breakpoints are sent to
the target which in turn receives the triggers and reports them back to GDB
for condition evaluation.  This is the standard evaluation mode.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint condition-evaluation target</code><dd>This option commands <span class="sc">gdb</span> to download breakpoint conditions
to the target at the moment of their insertion.  The target
is responsible for evaluating the conditional expression and reporting
breakpoint stop events back to <span class="sc">gdb</span> whenever the condition
is true.  Due to limitations of target-side evaluation, some conditions
cannot be evaluated there, e.g., conditions that depend on local data
that is only known to the host.  Examples include
conditional expressions involving convenience variables, complex types
that cannot be handled by the agent expression parser and expressions
that are too long to be sent over to the target, specially when the
target is a remote system.  In these cases, the conditions will be
evaluated by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint condition-evaluation auto</code><dd>This is the default mode.  If the target supports evaluating breakpoint
conditions on its end, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will download breakpoint conditions to
the target (limitations mentioned previously apply).  If the target does
not support breakpoint condition evaluation, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will fallback
to evaluating all these conditions on the host's side. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-negative-breakpoint-numbers-252"></a><a name="index-internal-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-breakpoints-253"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> itself sometimes sets breakpoints in your program for
special purposes, such as proper handling of <code>longjmp</code> (in C
programs).  These internal breakpoints are assigned negative numbers,
starting with <code>-1</code>; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info breakpoints</span></samp>&rsquo; does not display them. 
You can see these breakpoints with the <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintenance command

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 Setting Watchpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-setting-watchpoints-254"></a>You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an
expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where
this may happen.  (This is sometimes called a <dfn>data breakpoint</dfn>.) 
The expression may be as simple as the value of a single variable, or
as complex as many variables combined by operators.  Examples include:

     <ul>
<li>A reference to the value of a single variable.

     <li>An address cast to an appropriate data type.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*(int *)0x12345678</span></samp>&rsquo; will watch a 4-byte region at the specified
address (assuming an <code>int</code> occupies 4 bytes).

     <li>An arbitrarily complex expression, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a*b + c/d</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
expression can use any operators valid in the program's native
language (see <a href="#Languages">Languages</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>You can set a watchpoint on an expression even if the expression can
not be evaluated yet.  For instance, you can set a watchpoint on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*global_ptr</span></samp>&rsquo; before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global_ptr</span></samp>&rsquo; is initialized. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will stop when your program sets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global_ptr</span></samp>&rsquo; and
the expression produces a valid value.  If the expression becomes
valid in some other way than changing a variable (e.g. if the memory
pointed to by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*global_ptr</span></samp>&rsquo; becomes readable as the result of a
<code>malloc</code> call), <span class="sc">gdb</span> may not stop until the next time
the expression changes.

   <p><a name="index-software-watchpoints-255"></a><a name="index-hardware-watchpoints-256"></a>Depending on your system, watchpoints may be implemented in software or
hardware.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does software watchpointing by single-stepping your
program and testing the variable's value each time, which is hundreds of
times slower than normal execution.  (But this may still be worth it, to
catch errors where you have no clue what part of your program is the
culprit.)

   <p>On some systems, such as HP-UX, PowerPC, <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and most other
x86-based targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> includes support for hardware
watchpoints, which do not slow down the running of your program.

     
<a name="index-watch-257"></a>
<dl><dt><code>watch </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>-l</code><span class="roman">|</span><code>-location</code><span class="roman">]</span> <var>expr</var> <span class="roman">[</span><code>thread </code><var>threadnum</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><code>mask </code><var>maskvalue</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Set a watchpoint for an expression.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will break when the
expression <var>expr</var> is written into by the program and its value
changes.  The simplest (and the most popular) use of this command is
to watch the value of a single variable:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) watch foo
</pre>
     <p>If the command includes a <span class="roman">[</span><code>thread </code><var>threadnum</var><span class="roman">]</span>
argument, <span class="sc">gdb</span> breaks only when the thread identified by
<var>threadnum</var> changes the value of <var>expr</var>.  If any other threads
change the value of <var>expr</var>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not break.  Note
that watchpoints restricted to a single thread in this way only work
with Hardware Watchpoints.

     <p>Ordinarily a watchpoint respects the scope of variables in <var>expr</var>
(see below).  The <code>-location</code> argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to
instead watch the memory referred to by <var>expr</var>.  In this case,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will evaluate <var>expr</var>, take the address of the result,
and watch the memory at that address.  The type of the result is used
to determine the size of the watched memory.  If the expression's
result does not have an address, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will print an
error.

     <p>The <span class="roman">[</span><code>mask </code><var>maskvalue</var><span class="roman">]</span> argument allows creation
of masked watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this
feature (e.g., PowerPC Embedded architecture, see <a href="#PowerPC-Embedded">PowerPC Embedded</a>.)  A <dfn>masked watchpoint</dfn> specifies a mask in addition
to an address to watch.  The mask specifies that some bits of an address
(the bits which are reset in the mask) should be ignored when matching
the address accessed by the inferior against the watchpoint address. 
Thus, a masked watchpoint watches many addresses simultaneously&mdash;those
addresses whose unmasked bits are identical to the unmasked bits in the
watchpoint address.  The <code>mask</code> argument implies <code>-location</code>. 
Examples:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) watch foo mask 0xffff00ff
          (gdb) watch *0xdeadbeef mask 0xffffff00
</pre>

</dl>

   <p>If you watch for a change in a numerically entered address you need to
dereference it, as the address itself is just a constant number which will
never change.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> refuses to create a watchpoint that watches
a never-changing value:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) watch 0x600850
     Cannot watch constant value 0x600850.
     (gdb) watch *(int *) 0x600850
     Watchpoint 1: *(int *) 6293584
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> sets a <dfn>hardware watchpoint</dfn> if possible.  Hardware
watchpoints execute very quickly, and the debugger reports a change in
value at the exact instruction where the change occurs.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span>
cannot set a hardware watchpoint, it sets a software watchpoint, which
executes more slowly and reports the change in value at the next
<em>statement</em>, not the instruction, after the change occurs.

   <p><a name="index-use-only-software-watchpoints-261"></a>You can force <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use only software watchpoints with the
<kbd>set can-use-hw-watchpoints 0</kbd> command.  With this variable set to
zero, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will never try to use hardware watchpoints, even if
the underlying system supports them.  (Note that hardware-assisted
watchpoints that were set <em>before</em> setting
<code>can-use-hw-watchpoints</code> to zero will still use the hardware
mechanism of watching expression values.)

     <dl>
<dt><code>set can-use-hw-watchpoints</code><dd><a name="index-set-can_002duse_002dhw_002dwatchpoints-262"></a>Set whether or not to use hardware watchpoints.

     <br><dt><code>show can-use-hw-watchpoints</code><dd><a name="index-show-can_002duse_002dhw_002dwatchpoints-263"></a>Show the current mode of using hardware watchpoints. 
</dl>

   <p>For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware
watchpoints <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use, see <a href="#set-remote-hardware_002dbreakpoint_002dlimit">set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit</a>.

   <p>When you issue the <code>watch</code> command, <span class="sc">gdb</span> reports

<pre class="smallexample">     Hardware watchpoint <var>num</var>: <var>expr</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if it was able to set a hardware watchpoint.

   <p>Currently, the <code>awatch</code> and <code>rwatch</code> commands can only set
hardware watchpoints, because accesses to data that don't change the
value of the watched expression cannot be detected without examining
every instruction as it is being executed, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not do
that currently.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds that it is unable to set a
hardware breakpoint with the <code>awatch</code> or <code>rwatch</code> command, it
will print a message like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Expression cannot be implemented with read/access watchpoint.
</pre>
   <p>Sometimes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot set a hardware watchpoint because the
data type of the watched expression is wider than what a hardware
watchpoint on the target machine can handle.  For example, some systems
can only watch regions that are up to 4 bytes wide; on such systems you
cannot set hardware watchpoints for an expression that yields a
double-precision floating-point number (which is typically 8 bytes
wide).  As a work-around, it might be possible to break the large region
into a series of smaller ones and watch them with separate watchpoints.

   <p>If you set too many hardware watchpoints, <span class="sc">gdb</span> might be unable
to insert all of them when you resume the execution of your program. 
Since the precise number of active watchpoints is unknown until such
time as the program is about to be resumed, <span class="sc">gdb</span> might not be
able to warn you about this when you set the watchpoints, and the
warning will be printed only when the program is resumed:

<pre class="smallexample">     Hardware watchpoint <var>num</var>: Could not insert watchpoint
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If this happens, delete or disable some of the watchpoints.

   <p>Watching complex expressions that reference many variables can also
exhaust the resources available for hardware-assisted watchpoints. 
That's because <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to watch every variable in the
expression with separately allocated resources.

   <p>If you call a function interactively using <code>print</code> or <code>call</code>,
any watchpoints you have set will be inactive until <span class="sc">gdb</span> reaches another
kind of breakpoint or the call completes.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically deletes watchpoints that watch local
(automatic) variables, or expressions that involve such variables, when
they go out of scope, that is, when the execution leaves the block in
which these variables were defined.  In particular, when the program
being debugged terminates, <em>all</em> local variables go out of scope,
and so only watchpoints that watch global variables remain set.  If you
rerun the program, you will need to set all such watchpoints again.  One
way of doing that would be to set a code breakpoint at the entry to the
<code>main</code> function and when it breaks, set all the watchpoints.

   <p><a name="index-watchpoints-and-threads-264"></a><a name="index-threads-and-watchpoints-265"></a>In multi-threaded programs, watchpoints will detect changes to the
watched expression from every thread.

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> In multi-threaded programs, software watchpoints
have only limited usefulness.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span> creates a software
watchpoint, it can only watch the value of an expression <em>in a
single thread</em>.  If you are confident that the expression can only
change due to the current thread's activity (and if you are also
confident that no other thread can become current), then you can use
software watchpoints as usual.  However, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may not notice
when a non-current thread's activity changes the expression.  (Hardware
watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)

<p><a name="index-catchpoints_002c-setting-266"></a><a name="index-exception-handlers-267"></a><a name="index-event-handling-268"></a>
You can use <dfn>catchpoints</dfn> to cause the debugger to stop for certain
kinds of program events, such as C<tt>++</tt> exceptions or the loading of a
shared library.  Use the <code>catch</code> command to set a catchpoint.

     
<a name="index-catch-269"></a>
<dl><dt><code>catch </code><var>event</var><dd>Stop when <var>event</var> occurs.  The <var>event</var> can be any of the following:

          <p>If <var>regexp</var> is given, then only exceptions whose type matches the
regular expression will be caught.

          <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fexception_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-274"></a>The convenience variable <code>$_exception</code> is available at an
exception-related catchpoint, on some systems.  This holds the
exception being thrown.

          <p>There are currently some limitations to C<tt>++</tt> exception handling in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>:

               <ul>
<li>The support for these commands is system-dependent.  Currently, only
systems using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu-v3</span></samp>&rsquo; C<tt>++</tt> ABI (see <a href="#ABI">ABI</a>) are
supported.

               <li>The regular expression feature and the <code>$_exception</code> convenience
variable rely on the presence of some SDT probes in <code>libstdc++</code>. 
If these probes are not present, then these features cannot be used. 
These probes were first available in the GCC 4.8 release, but whether
or not they are available in your GCC also depends on how it was
built.

               <li>The <code>$_exception</code> convenience variable is only valid at the
instruction at which an exception-related catchpoint is set.

               <li>When an exception-related catchpoint is hit, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops at a
location in the system library which implements runtime exception
support for C<tt>++</tt>, usually <code>libstdc++</code>.  You can use <code>up</code>
(see <a href="#Selection">Selection</a>) to get to your code.

               <li>If you call a function interactively, <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally returns
control to you when the function has finished executing.  If the call
raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that
returns control to you and cause your program either to abort or to
simply continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> is listening for, or exits.  This is the case even if
you set a catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are
disabled within interactive calls.  See <a href="#Calling">Calling</a>, for information on
controlling this with <code>set unwind-on-terminating-exception</code>.

               <li>You cannot raise an exception interactively.

               <li>You cannot install an exception handler interactively.

          <br><dt><code>exception unhandled</code><dd><a name="index-catch-exception-unhandled-281"></a>An exception that was raised but is not handled by the program.

A
syscall is a mechanism for application programs to request a service
from the operating system (OS) or one of the OS system services. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can catch some or all of the syscalls issued by the
debuggee, and show the related information for each syscall.  If no
argument is specified, calls to and returns from all system calls
will be caught.

          <p><var>name</var> can be any system call name that is valid for the
underlying OS.  Just what syscalls are valid depends on the OS.  On
GNU and Unix systems, you can find the full list of valid syscall
names on <samp><span class="file">/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</span></samp>.

          <!-- For MS-Windows, the syscall names and the corresponding numbers -->
          <!-- can be found, e.g., on this URL: -->
          <!-- http://www.metasploit.com/users/opcode/syscalls.html -->
          <!-- but we don't support Windows syscalls yet. -->
          <p>Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows in advance which syscalls are valid for
each OS, so you can use the <span class="sc">gdb</span> command-line completion
facilities (see <a href="#Completion">command completion</a>) to list the
available choices.

          <p>You may also specify the system call numerically.  A syscall's
number is the value passed to the OS's syscall dispatcher to
identify the requested service.  When you specify the syscall by its
name, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses its database of syscalls to convert the name
into the corresponding numeric code, but using the number directly
may be useful if <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s database does not have the complete
list of syscalls on your system (e.g., because <span class="sc">gdb</span> lags
behind the OS upgrades).

          <p>The example below illustrates how this command works if you don't provide
arguments to it:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'close'), \
               	   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'close'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>Here is an example of catching a system call by name:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall chroot
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'chroot' [61])
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'chroot'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'chroot'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>An example of specifying a system call numerically.  In the case
below, the syscall number has a corresponding entry in the XML
file, so <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds its name and prints it:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 'exit_group')
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'exit_group'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>However, there can be situations when there is no corresponding name
in XML file for that syscall number.  In this case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints
a warning message saying that it was not able to find the syscall name,
but the catchpoint will be set anyway.  See the example below:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 764
               warning: The number '764' does not represent a known syscall.
               Catchpoint 2 (syscall 764)
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>If you configure <span class="sc">gdb</span> using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--without-expat</span></samp>&rsquo; option,
it will not be able to display syscall names.  Also, if your
architecture does not have an XML file describing its system calls,
you will not be able to see the syscall names.  It is important to
notice that these two features are used for accessing the syscall
name database.  In either case, you will see a warning like this:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall
               warning: Could not open "syscalls/i386-linux.xml"
               warning: Could not load the syscall XML file 'syscalls/i386-linux.xml'.
               GDB will not be able to display syscall names.
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>Of course, the file name will change depending on your architecture and system.

          <p>Still using the example above, you can also try to catch a syscall by its
number.  In this case, you would see something like:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 252)
</pre>
          <p>Again, in this case <span class="sc">gdb</span> would not be able to display syscall's names.

breakpoint that has been deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.

   <p>With the <code>clear</code> command you can delete breakpoints according to
where they are in your program.  With the <code>delete</code> command you can
delete individual breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints by specifying
their breakpoint numbers.

   <p>It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-enable_002fdisable-a-breakpoint-299"></a>Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might
prefer to <dfn>disable</dfn> it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if
it had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so
that you can <dfn>enable</dfn> it again later.

   <p>You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints with
the <code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands, optionally specifying
one or more breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use <code>info break</code> to
print a list of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints if you
do not know which numbers to use.

   <p>Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations
affects all of its locations.

   <p>A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of several
different states of enablement:

     <ul>
<li>Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set
with the <code>break</code> command starts out in this state. 
<li>Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program. 
<li>Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
disabled. 
<li>Enabled for a count.  The breakpoint stops your program for the next
N times, then becomes disabled. 
<li>Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.  A breakpoint
set with the <code>tbreak</code> command starts out in this state. 
</ul>

   <p>You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints,
watchpoints, and catchpoints:

     
<a name="index-disable-300"></a>

<span class="sc">gdb</span> disables that breakpoint.  If a breakpoint has an ignore
count (see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>), that will be
decremented to 0 before <var>count</var> is affected.

</dl>

<!-- FIXME: I think the following ``Except for [...] @code{tbreak}'' is -->
<!-- confusing: tbreak is also initially enabled. -->
   <p>Except for a breakpoint set with <code>tbreak</code> (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command <code>until</code> can set and delete a

breakpoints; see <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.)

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.6 Break Conditions</h4>

<p><a name="index-conditional-breakpoints-303"></a><a name="index-breakpoint-conditions-304"></a>
<!-- FIXME what is scope of break condition expr?  Context where wanted? -->
<!-- in particular for a watchpoint? -->
The simplest sort of breakpoint breaks every time your program reaches a
specified place.  You can also specify a <dfn>condition</dfn> for a
breakpoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  A breakpoint with
a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it,
and your program stops only if the condition is <em>true</em>.

   <p>This is the converse of using assertions for program validation; in that
situation, you want to stop when the assertion is violated&mdash;that is,
when the condition is false.  In C, if you want to test an assertion expressed
by the condition <var>assert</var>, you should set the condition
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">! </span><var>assert</var></samp>&rsquo; on the appropriate breakpoint.

   <p>Conditions are also accepted for watchpoints; you may not need them,
since a watchpoint is inspecting the value of an expression anyhow&mdash;but
it might be simpler, say, to just set a watchpoint on a variable name,
and specify a condition that tests whether the new value is an interesting
one.

   <p>Break conditions can have side effects, and may even call functions in
your program.  This can be useful, for example, to activate functions
that log program progress, or to use your own print functions to
format special data structures.  The effects are completely predictable
unless there is another enabled breakpoint at the same address.  (In
that case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> might see the other breakpoint first and stop your
program without checking the condition of this one.)  Note that
breakpoint commands are usually more convenient and flexible than break
conditions for the
purpose of performing side effects when a breakpoint is reached
(see <a href="#Break-Commands">Breakpoint Command Lists</a>).

   <p>Breakpoint conditions can also be evaluated on the target's side if
the target supports it.  Instead of evaluating the conditions locally,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> encodes the expression into an agent expression
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>) suitable for execution on the target,
independently of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Global variables become raw memory
locations, locals become stack accesses, and so forth.

   <p>In this case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will only be notified of a breakpoint trigger
when its condition evaluates to true.  This mechanism may provide faster
response times depending on the performance characteristics of the target
since it does not need to keep <span class="sc">gdb</span> informed about
every breakpoint trigger, even those with false conditions.

   <p>Break conditions can be specified when a breakpoint is set, by using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>&rsquo; in the arguments to the <code>break</code> command.  See <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>.  They can also be changed at any time
with the <code>condition</code> command.

   <p>You can also use the <code>if</code> keyword with the <code>watch</code> command. 
The <code>catch</code> command does not recognize the <code>if</code> keyword;
<code>condition</code> is the only way to impose a further condition on a
catchpoint.

     
<a name="index-condition-305"></a>
<dl><dt><code>condition </code><var>bnum</var> <var>expression</var><dd>Specify <var>expression</var> as the break condition for breakpoint,
watchpoint, or catchpoint number <var>bnum</var>.  After you set a condition,
breakpoint <var>bnum</var> stops your program only if the value of
<var>expression</var> is true (nonzero, in C).  When you use
<code>condition</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> checks <var>expression</var> immediately for
syntactic correctness, and to determine whether symbols in it have
referents in the context of your breakpoint.  If <var>expression</var> uses
symbols not referenced in the context of the breakpoint, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
prints an error message:

     <pre class="smallexample">          No symbol "foo" in current context.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">gdb</span> does
not actually evaluate <var>expression</var> at the time the <code>condition</code>
command (or a command that sets a breakpoint with a condition, like
<code>break if ...</code>) is given, however.  See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt><code>condition </code><var>bnum</var><dd>Remove the condition from breakpoint number <var>bnum</var>.  It becomes
an ordinary unconditional breakpoint. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-ignore-count-_0028of-breakpoint_0029-306"></a>A special case of a breakpoint condition is to stop only when the
breakpoint has been reached a certain number of times.  This is so
useful that there is a special way to do it, using the <dfn>ignore
count</dfn> of the breakpoint.  Every breakpoint has an ignore count, which
is an integer.  Most of the time, the ignore count is zero, and
therefore has no effect.  But if your program reaches a breakpoint whose
ignore count is positive, then instead of stopping, it just decrements
the ignore count by one and continues.  As a result, if the ignore count
value is <var>n</var>, the breakpoint does not stop the next <var>n</var> times
your program reaches it.

     
<a name="index-ignore-307"></a>
<dl><dt><code>ignore </code><var>bnum</var> <var>count</var><dd>Set the ignore count of breakpoint number <var>bnum</var> to <var>count</var>. 
The next <var>count</var> times the breakpoint is reached, your program's
execution does not stop; other than to decrement the ignore count, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
takes no action.

     <p>To make the breakpoint stop the next time it is reached, specify
a count of zero.

     <p>When you use <code>continue</code> to resume execution of your program from a
breakpoint, you can specify an ignore count directly as an argument to
<code>continue</code>, rather than using <code>ignore</code>.  See <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.

     <p>If a breakpoint has a positive ignore count and a condition, the
condition is not checked.  Once the ignore count reaches zero,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> resumes checking the condition.

     <p>You could achieve the effect of the ignore count with a condition such
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$foo--&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;0</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> using a debugger convenience variable that
is decremented each time.  See <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>Ignore counts apply to breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints.

<code>end</code> to terminate the commands.

     <p>To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type <code>commands</code> and
follow it immediately with <code>end</code>; that is, give no commands.

     <p>With no argument, <code>commands</code> refers to the last breakpoint,
watchpoint, or catchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently
encountered).  If the most recent breakpoints were set with a single
command, then the <code>commands</code> will apply to all the breakpoints
set by that command.  This applies to breakpoints set by
<code>rbreak</code>, and also applies when a single <code>break</code> command
creates multiple breakpoints (see <a href="#Ambiguous-Expressions">Ambiguous Expressions</a>). 
</dl>

   <p>Pressing &lt;RET&gt; as a means of repeating the last <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is
disabled within a <var>command-list</var>.

   <p>You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply
use the <code>continue</code> command, or <code>step</code>, or any other command
that resumes execution.

   <p>Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes
execution, are ignored.  This is because any time you resume execution
(even with a simple <code>next</code> or <code>step</code>), you may encounter
another breakpoint&mdash;which could have its own command list, leading to
ambiguities about which list to execute.

   <p><a name="index-silent-311"></a>If the first command you specify in a command list is <code>silent</code>, the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may
be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
then continue.  If none of the remaining commands print anything, you
see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.  <code>silent</code> is
meaningful only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.

   <p>The commands <code>echo</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>printf</code> allow you to
print precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent
breakpoints.  See <a href="#Output">Commands for Controlled Output</a>.

   <p>For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print the
value of <code>x</code> at entry to <code>foo</code> whenever <code>x</code> is positive.

<pre class="smallexample">     break foo if x&gt;0
     commands
     silent
     printf "x is %d\n",x
     cont
     end
</pre>
   <p>One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug so
you can test for another.  Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous line
of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something
erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values
to any variables that need them.  End with the <code>continue</code> command
so that your program does not stop, and start with the <code>silent</code>
command so that no output is produced.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     break 403
     commands
     silent
     set x = y + 4
     cont
     end

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.8 Dynamic Printf</h4>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-printf-312"></a><a name="index-dprintf-313"></a>The dynamic printf command <code>dprintf</code> combines a breakpoint with
formatted printing of your program's data to give you the effect of
inserting <code>printf</code> calls into your program on-the-fly, without
having to recompile it.

   <p>In its most basic form, the output goes to the GDB console.  However,
you can set the variable <code>dprintf-style</code> for alternate handling. 
For instance, you can ask to format the output by calling your
program's <code>printf</code> function.  This has the advantage that the
characters go to the program's output device, so they can recorded in
redirects to files and so forth.

   <p>If you are doing remote debugging with a stub or agent, you can also
ask to have the printf handled by the remote agent.  In addition to
ensuring that the output goes to the remote program's device along
with any other output the program might produce, you can also ask that
the dprintf remain active even after disconnecting from the remote
target.  Using the stub/agent is also more efficient, as it can do
everything without needing to communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     
<a name="index-dprintf-314"></a>
<dl><dt><code>dprintf </code><var>location</var><code>,</code><var>template</var><code>,</code><var>expression</var><code>[,</code><var>expression</var><code>...]</code><dd>Whenever execution reaches <var>location</var>, print the values of one or

To print several values, separate them with commas.

     <br><dt><code>set dprintf-style </code><var>style</var><dd>Set the dprintf output to be handled in one of several different
styles enumerated below.  A change of style affects all existing
dynamic printfs immediately.  (If you need individual control over the

explicitly-supplied command lists.)

     <br><dt><code>gdb</code><dd><a name="index-dprintf_002dstyle-gdb-315"></a>Handle the output using the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>printf</code> command.

     <br><dt><code>call</code><dd><a name="index-dprintf_002dstyle-call-316"></a>Handle the output by calling a function in your program (normally

     <br><dt><code>set dprintf-function </code><var>function</var><dd>Set the function to call if the dprintf style is <code>call</code>.  By

command.

     <br><dt><code>set dprintf-channel </code><var>channel</var><dd>Set a &ldquo;channel&rdquo; for dprintf.  If set to a non-empty value,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will evaluate it as an expression and pass the result as
a first argument to the <code>dprintf-function</code>, in the manner of
<code>fprintf</code> and similar functions.  Otherwise, the dprintf format
string will be the first argument, in the manner of <code>printf</code>.

     <p>As an example, if you wanted <code>dprintf</code> output to go to a logfile
that is a standard I/O stream assigned to the variable <code>mylog</code>,
you could do the following:

     <pre class="example">          (gdb) set dprintf-style call
          (gdb) set dprintf-function fprintf
          (gdb) set dprintf-channel mylog
          (gdb) dprintf 25,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob
          Dprintf 1 at 0x123456: file main.c, line 25.
          (gdb) info break
          1       dprintf        keep y   0x00123456 in main at main.c:25
                  call (void) fprintf (mylog,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob)
                  continue
          (gdb)
</pre>
     <p>Note that the <code>info break</code> displays the dynamic printf commands
as normal breakpoint commands; you can thus easily see the effect of
the variable settings.

may be the values of local variables, but if that is the case, then
all enabled dynamic prints must be at locations within the scope of
those locals.  If evaluation fails, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will report an error.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.10 Static Probe Points</h4>

<p><a name="index-static-probe-point_002c-SystemTap-322"></a><a name="index-static-probe-point_002c-DTrace-323"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports <dfn>SDT</dfn> probes in the code.  <acronym>SDT</acronym> stands
for Statically Defined Tracing, and the probes are designed to have a tiny
runtime code and data footprint, and no dynamic relocations.

   <p>Currently, the following types of probes are supported on
ELF-compatible systems:

     <ul>
<li><code>SystemTap</code> (<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/</a>)
<acronym>SDT</acronym> probes<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.  <code>SystemTap</code> probes are usable
from assembly, C and C<tt>++</tt> languages<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

     <li><code>DTrace</code> (<a href="http://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace">http://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace</a>)
<acronym>USDT</acronym> probes.  <code>DTrace</code> probes are usable from C and
C<tt>++</tt> languages. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-semaphores-on-static-probe-points-324"></a>Some <code>SystemTap</code> probes have an associated semaphore variable;
for instance, this happens automatically if you defined your probe
using a DTrace-style <samp><span class="file">.d</span></samp> file.  If your probe has a semaphore,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically enable it when you specify a
breakpoint using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-probe-stap</span></samp>&rsquo; notation.  But, if you put a
breakpoint at a probe's location by some other method (e.g.,
<code>break file:line</code>), then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not automatically set
the semaphore.  <code>DTrace</code> probes do not support semaphores.

   <p>You can examine the available static static probes using <code>info

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fprobe_005farg_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-329"></a>A probe may specify up to twelve arguments.  These are available at the
point at which the probe is defined&mdash;that is, when the current PC is
at the probe's location.  The arguments are available using the
convenience variables (see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Vars</a>)
<code>$_probe_arg0</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>$_probe_arg11</code>.  In <code>SystemTap</code>
probes each probe argument is an integer of the appropriate size;
types are not preserved.  In <code>DTrace</code> probes types are preserved
provided that they are recognized as such by <span class="sc">gdb</span>; otherwise
the value of the probe argument will be a long integer.  The
convenience variable <code>$_probe_argc</code> holds the number of arguments
at the current probe point.

   <p>These variables are always available, but attempts to access them at
any location other than a probe point will cause <span class="sc">gdb</span> to give
an error message.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.12 &ldquo;Breakpoint address adjusted...&rdquo;</h4>

<p><a name="index-breakpoint-address-adjusted-330"></a>
Some processor architectures place constraints on the addresses at
which breakpoints may be placed.  For architectures thus constrained,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will attempt to adjust the breakpoint's address to comply
with the constraints dictated by the architecture.

   <p>One example of such an architecture is the Fujitsu FR-V.  The FR-V is
a VLIW architecture in which a number of RISC-like instructions may be
bundled together for parallel execution.  The FR-V architecture
constrains the location of a breakpoint instruction within such a
bundle to the instruction with the lowest address.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
honors this constraint by adjusting a breakpoint's address to the
first in the bundle.

   <p>It is not uncommon for optimized code to have bundles which contain
instructions from different source statements, thus it may happen that
a breakpoint's address will be adjusted from one source statement to
another.  Since this adjustment may significantly alter <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
breakpoint related behavior from what the user expects, a warning is
printed when the breakpoint is first set and also when the breakpoint
is hit.

   <p>A warning like the one below is printed when setting a breakpoint
that's been subject to address adjustment:

<pre class="smallexample">     warning: Breakpoint address adjusted from 0x00010414 to 0x00010410.
</pre>
   <p>Such warnings are printed both for user settable and <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
internal breakpoints.  If you see one of these warnings, you should
verify that a breakpoint set at the adjusted address will have the
desired affect.  If not, the breakpoint in question may be removed and
other breakpoints may be set which will have the desired behavior. 
E.g., it may be sufficient to place the breakpoint at a later
instruction.  A conditional breakpoint may also be useful in some
cases to prevent the breakpoint from triggering too often.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will also issue a warning when stopping at one of these
adjusted breakpoints:

<pre class="smallexample">     warning: Breakpoint 1 address previously adjusted from 0x00010414
     to 0x00010410.
</pre>
   <p>When this warning is encountered, it may be too late to take remedial
action except in cases where the breakpoint is hit earlier or more
frequently than expected.

completes normally.  In contrast, <dfn>stepping</dfn> means executing just
one more &ldquo;step&rdquo; of your program, where &ldquo;step&rdquo; may mean either one
line of source code, or one machine instruction (depending on what
particular command you use).  Either when continuing or when stepping,
your program may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint or a signal.  (If
it stops due to a signal, you may want to use <code>handle</code>, or use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal 0</span></samp>&rsquo; to resume execution (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>),

any breakpoints set at that address are bypassed.  The optional argument
<var>ignore-count</var> allows you to specify a further number of times to

<code>ignore</code> (see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>).

     <p>The argument <var>ignore-count</var> is meaningful only when your program
stopped due to a breakpoint.  At other times, the argument to
<code>continue</code> is ignored.

     <p>The synonyms <code>c</code> and <code>fg</code> (for <dfn>foreground</dfn>, as the

   <p>To resume execution at a different place, you can use <code>return</code>
(see <a href="#Returning">Returning from a Function</a>) to go back to the
calling function; or <code>jump</code> (see <a href="#Jumping">Continuing at a Different Address</a>) to go to an arbitrary location in your program.

   <p>A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint
(see <a href="#Breakpoints">Breakpoints; Watchpoints; and Catchpoints</a>) at the
beginning of the function or the section of your program where a problem
is believed to lie, run your program until it stops at that breakpoint,
and then step through the suspect area, examining the variables that are
interesting, until you see the problem happen.

<em>Warning:</em> If you use the <code>step</code> command while control is

execution proceeds until control reaches a function that does have
debugging information.  Likewise, it will not step into a function which

without debugging information, use the <code>stepi</code> command, described
below. 
</blockquote>

     <p>The <code>step</code> command only stops at the first instruction of a source
line.  This prevents the multiple stops that could otherwise occur in
<code>switch</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, etc.  <code>step</code> continues
to stop if a function that has debugging information is called within
the line.  In other words, <code>step</code> <em>steps inside</em> any functions
called within the line.

     <p>Also, the <code>step</code> command only enters a function if there is line
number information for the function.  Otherwise it acts like the
<code>next</code> command.  This avoids problems when using <code>cc -gl</code>

     <p>The <code>next</code> command only stops at the first instruction of a
source line.  This prevents multiple stops that could otherwise occur in
<code>switch</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, etc.

abbreviated as <code>fin</code>.

     <p>Contrast this with the <code>return</code> command (see <a href="#Returning">Returning from a Function</a>).

     <p><a name="index-until-346"></a><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007buntil_007d_0029_007d-347"></a><a name="index-run-until-specified-location-348"></a><br><dt><code>until</code><dt><code>u</code><dd>Continue running until a source line past the current line, in the
current stack frame, is reached.  This command is used to avoid single
stepping through a loop more than once.  It is like the <code>next</code>
command, except that when <code>until</code> encounters a jump, it
automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater
than the address of the jump.

     <p>This means that when you reach the end of a loop after single stepping
though it, <code>until</code> makes your program continue execution until it
exits the loop.  In contrast, a <code>next</code> command at the end of a loop
simply steps back to the beginning of the loop, which forces you to step
through the next iteration.

     <p><code>until</code> always stops your program if it attempts to exit the current
stack frame.

     <p><code>until</code> may produce somewhat counterintuitive results if the order
of machine code does not match the order of the source lines.  For
example, in the following excerpt from a debugging session, the <code>f</code>
(<code>frame</code>) command shows that execution is stopped at line
<code>206</code>; yet when we use <code>until</code>, we get to line <code>195</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) f
          #0  main (argc=4, argv=0xf7fffae8) at m4.c:206
          206                 expand_input();
          (gdb) until
          195             for ( ; argc &gt; 0; NEXTARG) {
</pre>
     <p>This happened because, for execution efficiency, the compiler had
generated code for the loop closure test at the end, rather than the
start, of the loop&mdash;even though the test in a C <code>for</code>-loop is
written before the body of the loop.  The <code>until</code> command appeared
to step back to the beginning of the loop when it advanced to this
expression; however, it has not really gone to an earlier
statement&mdash;not in terms of the actual machine code.

     <p><code>until</code> with no argument works by means of single
instruction stepping, and hence is slower than <code>until</code> with an
argument.

     <br><dt><code>until </code><var>location</var><dt><code>u </code><var>location</var><dd>Continue running your program until either the specified <var>location</var> is
reached, or the current stack frame returns.  The location is any of
the forms described in <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>. 
This form of the command uses temporary breakpoints, and
hence is quicker than <code>until</code> without an argument.  The specified
location is actually reached only if it is in the current frame.  This
implies that <code>until</code> can be used to skip over recursive function
invocations.  For instance in the code below, if the current location is
line <code>96</code>, issuing <code>until 99</code> will execute the program up to
line <code>99</code> in the same invocation of factorial, i.e., after the inner
invocations have returned.

     <pre class="smallexample">          94	int factorial (int value)
          95	{
          96	    if (value &gt; 1) {
          97            value *= factorial (value - 1);
          98	    }
          99	    return (value);
          100     }

required, which should be of one of the forms described in
<a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>. 
Execution will also stop upon exit from the current stack
frame.  This command is similar to <code>until</code>, but <code>advance</code> will
not skip over recursive function calls, and the target location doesn't
have to be in the same frame as the current one.

   <p><a name="range-stepping"></a><a name="index-range-stepping-354"></a><a name="index-target_002dassisted-range-stepping-355"></a>By default, and if available, <span class="sc">gdb</span> makes use of
target-assisted <dfn>range stepping</dfn>.  In other words, whenever you
use a stepping command (e.g., <code>step</code>, <code>next</code>), <span class="sc">gdb</span>
tells the target to step the corresponding range of instruction
addresses instead of issuing multiple single-steps.  This speeds up
line stepping, particularly for remote targets.  Ideally, there should
be no reason you would want to turn range stepping off.  However, it's
possible that a bug in the debug info, a bug in the remote stub (for
remote targets), or even a bug in <span class="sc">gdb</span> could make line
stepping behave incorrectly when target-assisted range stepping is
enabled.  You can use the following command to turn off range stepping
if necessary:

<a name="index-show-range_002dstepping-357"></a>

     <p>If <code>on</code>, and the target supports it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tells the
target to step a range of addresses itself, instead of issuing
multiple single-steps.  If <code>off</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> always issues
single-steps, even if range stepping is supported by the target.  The
default is <code>on</code>.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Skipping Over Functions and Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-skipping-over-functions-and-files-358"></a>
The program you are debugging may contain some functions which are
uninteresting to debug.  The <code>skip</code> comand lets you tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to
skip a function or all functions in a file when stepping.

   <p>For example, consider the following C function:

<pre class="smallexample">     101     int func()
     102     {
     103         foo(boring());
     104         bar(boring());
     105     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Suppose you wish to step into the functions <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, but you
are not interested in stepping through <code>boring</code>.  If you run <code>step</code>
at line 103, you'll enter <code>boring()</code>, but if you run <code>next</code>, you'll
step over both <code>foo</code> and <code>boring</code>!

   <p>One solution is to <code>step</code> into <code>boring</code> and use the <code>finish</code>
command to immediately exit it.  But this can become tedious if <code>boring</code>
is called from many places.

   <p>A more flexible solution is to execute <kbd>skip boring</kbd>.  This instructs
<span class="sc">gdb</span> never to step into <code>boring</code>.  Now when you execute
<code>step</code> at line 103, you'll step over <code>boring</code> and directly into
<code>foo</code>.

   <p>You can also instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to skip all functions in a file, with, for
example, <code>skip file boring.c</code>.

     
<a name="index-skip-function-359"></a>
<dl><dt><code>skip </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>linespec</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>skip function </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>linespec</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>After running this command, the function named by <var>linespec</var> or the
function containing the line named by <var>linespec</var> will be skipped over when
stepping.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.

     <p>If you do not specify <var>linespec</var>, the function you're currently debugging
will be skipped.

     <p>(If you have a function called <code>file</code> that you want to skip, use
<kbd>skip function file</kbd>.)

     <p><a name="index-skip-file-360"></a><br><dt><code>skip file </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>filename</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>After running this command, any function whose source lives in <var>filename</var>
will be skipped over when stepping.

     <p>If you do not specify <var>filename</var>, functions whose source lives in the file
you're currently debugging will be skipped. 
</dl>

   <p>Skips can be listed, deleted, disabled, and enabled, much like breakpoints. 
These are the commands for managing your list of skips:

<dt><em>Identifier</em><dd>A number identifying this skip. 
<br><dt><em>Type</em><dd>The type of this skip, either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">function</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Signals</h3>

<p><a name="index-signals-365"></a>
A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix <code>SIGINT</code> is the
signal a program gets when you type an interrupt character (often <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>);
<code>SIGSEGV</code> is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in
memory far away from all the areas in use; <code>SIGALRM</code> occurs when
the alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has
requested an alarm).

   <p><a name="index-fatal-signals-366"></a>Some signals, including <code>SIGALRM</code>, are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as <code>SIGSEGV</code>, indicate
errors; these signals are <dfn>fatal</dfn> (they kill your program immediately) if the
program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the signal. 
<code>SIGINT</code> does not indicate an error in your program, but it is normally
fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill the program.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your
program.  You can tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> in advance what to do for each kind of
signal.

   <p><a name="index-handling-signals-367"></a>Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is set up to let the non-erroneous signals like
<code>SIGALRM</code> be silently passed to your program
(so as not to interfere with their role in the program's functioning)
but to stop your program immediately whenever an error signal happens. 
You can change these settings with the <code>handle</code> command.

     
<a name="index-info-signals-368"></a>
<a name="index-info-handle-369"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info signals</code><dt><code>info handle</code><dd>Print a table of all the kinds of signals and how <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been told to
handle each one.  You can use this to see the signal numbers of all
the defined types of signals.

     <br><dt><code>info signals </code><var>sig</var><dd>Similar, but print information only about the specified signal number.

     <p><code>info handle</code> is an alias for <code>info signals</code>.

     <br><dt><code>catch signal </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>signal</var><code>... </code><span class="roman">|</span><code> &lsquo;</code><samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp><code>&rsquo;</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Set a catchpoint for the indicated signals.

     <p><a name="index-handle-370"></a><br><dt><code>handle </code><var>signal</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>keywords</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Change the way <span class="sc">gdb</span> handles signal <var>signal</var>.  The <var>signal</var>
can be the number of a signal or its name (with or without the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SIG</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning); a list of signal numbers of the form
&lsquo;<samp><var>low</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>high</var></samp>&rsquo;; or the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning all the
known signals.  Optional arguments <var>keywords</var>, described below,
say what change to make. 
</dl>

<!-- @group -->
   <p>The keywords allowed by the <code>handle</code> command can be abbreviated. 
Their full names are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nostop</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not stop your program when this signal happens.  It may
still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.

     <br><dt><code>stop</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should stop your program when this signal happens.  This implies
the <code>print</code> keyword as well.

     <br><dt><code>print</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should print a message when this signal happens.

     <br><dt><code>noprint</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all.  This
implies the <code>nostop</code> keyword as well.

     <br><dt><code>pass</code><dt><code>noignore</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should allow your program to see this signal; your program
can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal
and not handled.  <code>pass</code> and <code>noignore</code> are synonyms.

     <br><dt><code>nopass</code><dt><code>ignore</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> should not allow your program to see this signal. 
<code>nopass</code> and <code>ignore</code> are synonyms. 
</dl>
   <!-- @end group -->

   <p>When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible to the
program until you
continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if <code>pass</code> is in
effect for the signal in question <em>at that time</em>.  In other words,
after <span class="sc">gdb</span> reports a signal, you can use the <code>handle</code>
command with <code>pass</code> or <code>nopass</code> to control whether your
program sees that signal when you continue.

   <p>The default is set to <code>nostop</code>, <code>noprint</code>, <code>pass</code> for
non-erroneous signals such as <code>SIGALRM</code>, <code>SIGWINCH</code> and
<code>SIGCHLD</code>, and to <code>stop</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>pass</code> for the
erroneous signals.

   <p>You can also use the <code>signal</code> command to prevent your program from
seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see,
or to give it any signal at any time.  For example, if your program stopped
due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store correct
values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more
execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as
a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this,
you can continue with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="#Signaling">Giving your Program a Signal</a>.

   <p><a name="index-stepping-and-signal-handlers-371"></a><a name="stepping-and-signal-handlers"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> optimizes for stepping the mainline code.  If a signal
that has <code>handle nostop</code> and <code>handle pass</code> set arrives while
a stepping command (e.g., <code>stepi</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>next</code>) is
in progress, <span class="sc">gdb</span> lets the signal handler run and then resumes
stepping the mainline code once the signal handler returns.  In other
words, <span class="sc">gdb</span> steps over the signal handler.  This prevents
signals that you've specified as not interesting (with <code>handle
nostop</code>) from changing the focus of debugging unexpectedly.  Note that
the signal handler itself may still hit a breakpoint, stop for another
signal that has <code>handle stop</code> in effect, or for any other event
that normally results in stopping the stepping command sooner.  Also
note that <span class="sc">gdb</span> still informs you that the program received a
signal if <code>handle print</code> is set.

   <p><a name="stepping-into-signal-handlers"></a>If you set <code>handle pass</code> for a signal, and your program sets up a
handler for it, then issuing a stepping command, such as <code>step</code>
or <code>stepi</code>, when your program is stopped due to the signal will
step <em>into</em> the signal handler (if the target supports that).

   <p>Likewise, if you use the <code>queue-signal</code> command to queue a signal
to be delivered to the current thread when execution of the thread
resumes (see <a href="#Signaling">Giving your Program a Signal</a>), then a
stepping command will step into the signal handler.

   <p>Here's an example, using <code>stepi</code> to step to the first instruction
of <code>SIGUSR1</code>'s handler:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) handle SIGUSR1
     Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
     SIGUSR1       Yes       Yes     Yes             User defined signal 1
     (gdb) c
     Continuing.
     
     Program received signal SIGUSR1, User defined signal 1.
     main () sigusr1.c:28
     28        p = 0;
     (gdb) si
     sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
     9       {
</pre>
   <p>The same, but using <code>queue-signal</code> instead of waiting for the
program to receive the signal first:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) n
     28        p = 0;
     (gdb) queue-signal SIGUSR1
     (gdb) si
     sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
     9       {
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-extra-signal-information-372"></a><a name="extra-signal-information"></a>On some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can inspect extra signal information
associated with the intercepted signal, before it is actually
delivered to the program being debugged.  This information is exported
by the convenience variable <code>$_siginfo</code>, and consists of data
that is passed by the kernel to the signal handler at the time of the
receipt of a signal.  The data type of the information itself is
target dependent.  You can see the data type using the <code>ptype
$_siginfo</code> command.  On Unix systems, it typically corresponds to the
standard <code>siginfo_t</code> type, as defined in the <samp><span class="file">signal.h</span></samp>
system header.

   <p>Here's an example, on a <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux system, printing the stray
referenced address that raised a segmentation fault.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) continue
     Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

     (gdb) ptype $_siginfo
     type = struct {
         int si_signo;
         int si_errno;

<span class="sc">gdb</span> supports debugging programs with multiple threads
(see <a href="#Threads">Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</a>).  There
are two modes of controlling execution of your program within the

when any thread in your program stops (for example, at a breakpoint
or while being stepped), all other threads in the program are also stopped by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  On some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> also supports
<dfn>non-stop mode</dfn>, in which other threads can continue to run freely while
you examine the stopped thread in the debugger.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.1 All-Stop Mode</h4>

<p><a name="index-all_002dstop-mode-377"></a>
In all-stop mode, whenever your program stops under <span class="sc">gdb</span> for any reason,
<em>all</em> threads of execution stop, not just the current thread.  This
allows you to examine the overall state of the program, including
switching between threads, without worrying that things may change
underfoot.

   <p>Conversely, whenever you restart the program, <em>all</em> threads start
executing.  <em>This is true even when single-stepping</em> with commands
like <code>step</code> or <code>next</code>.

   <p>In particular, <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot single-step all threads in lockstep. 
Since thread scheduling is up to your debugging target's operating
system (not controlled by <span class="sc">gdb</span>), other threads may
execute more than one statement while the current thread completes a
single step.  Moreover, in general other threads stop in the middle of a
statement, rather than at a clean statement boundary, when the program
stops.

   <p>You might even find your program stopped in another thread after
continuing or even single-stepping.  This happens whenever some other
thread runs into a breakpoint, a signal, or an exception before the
first thread completes whatever you requested.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-thread-selection-378"></a><a name="index-switching-threads-automatically-379"></a><a name="index-threads_002c-automatic-switching-380"></a>Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops your program, due to a breakpoint or a
signal, it automatically selects the thread where that breakpoint or
signal happened.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> alerts you to the context switch with a
message such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Switching to Thread </span><var>n</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; to identify the
thread.

   <p>On some OSes, you can modify <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s default behavior by
locking the OS scheduler to allow only a single thread to run.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set scheduler-locking </code><var>mode</var><dd><a name="index-scheduler-locking-mode-381"></a><a name="index-lock-scheduler-382"></a>Set the scheduler locking mode.  If it is <code>off</code>, then there is no
locking and any thread may run at any time.  If <code>on</code>, then only the
current thread may run when the inferior is resumed.  The <code>step</code>
mode optimizes for single-stepping; it prevents other threads
from preempting the current thread while you are stepping, so that
the focus of debugging does not change unexpectedly. 
Other threads never get a chance to run when you step, and they are
completely free to run when you use commands
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">until</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">finish</span></samp>&rsquo;.  However, unless another
thread hits a breakpoint during its timeslice, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not change
the current thread away from the thread that you are debugging.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-resume-threads-of-multiple-processes-simultaneously-383"></a>By default, when you issue one of the execution commands such as
<code>continue</code>, <code>next</code> or <code>step</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> allows only
threads of the current inferior to run.  For example, if <span class="sc">gdb</span>
is attached to two inferiors, each with two threads, the
<code>continue</code> command resumes only the two threads of the current
inferior.  This is useful, for example, when you debug a program that
forks and you want to hold the parent stopped (so that, for instance,
it doesn't run to exit), while you debug the child.  In other
situations, you may not be interested in inspecting the current state
of any of the processes <span class="sc">gdb</span> is attached to, and you may want
to resume them all until some breakpoint is hit.  In the latter case,
you can instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to allow all threads of all the
inferiors to run with the <code>set&nbsp;schedule-multiple</code><!-- /@w --> command.

<!-- This section is really only a place-holder, and needs to be expanded -->
<!-- with more details. -->

   <p>For some multi-threaded targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports an optional
mode of operation in which you can examine stopped program threads in
the debugger while other threads continue to execute freely.  This
minimizes intrusion when debugging live systems, such as programs
where some threads have real-time constraints or must continue to
respond to external events.  This is referred to as <dfn>non-stop</dfn> mode.

   <p>In non-stop mode, when a thread stops to report a debugging event,
<em>only</em> that thread is stopped; <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not stop other
threads as well, in contrast to the all-stop mode behavior.  Additionally,
execution commands such as <code>continue</code> and <code>step</code> apply by default
only to the current thread in non-stop mode, rather than all threads as
in all-stop mode.  This allows you to control threads explicitly in
ways that are not possible in all-stop mode &mdash; for example, stepping
one thread while allowing others to run freely, stepping
one thread while holding all others stopped, or stepping several threads
independently and simultaneously.

   <p>To enter non-stop mode, use this sequence of commands before you run
or attach to your program:

<pre class="smallexample">     # If using the CLI, pagination breaks non-stop.
     set pagination off
     
     # Finally, turn it on!
     set non-stop on
</pre>
   <p>You can use these commands to manipulate the non-stop mode setting:

     
<a name="index-set-non_002dstop-386"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set non-stop on</code><dd>Enable selection of non-stop mode. 
<br><dt><code>set non-stop off</code><dd>Disable selection of non-stop mode. 
<a name="index-show-non_002dstop-387"></a><br><dt><code>show non-stop</code><dd>Show the current non-stop enablement setting. 
</dl>

   <p>Note these commands only reflect whether non-stop mode is enabled,
not whether the currently-executing program is being run in non-stop mode. 
In particular, the <code>set non-stop</code> preference is only consulted when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> starts or connects to the target program, and it is generally
not possible to switch modes once debugging has started.  Furthermore,
since not all targets support non-stop mode, even when you have enabled
non-stop mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may still fall back to all-stop operation by
default.

   <p>In non-stop mode, all execution commands apply only to the current thread
by default.  That is, <code>continue</code> only continues one thread. 
To continue all threads, issue <code>continue -a</code> or <code>c -a</code>.

   <p>You can use <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s background execution commands
(see <a href="#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>) to run some threads in the background
while you continue to examine or step others from <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
The MI execution commands (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Program-Execution">GDB/MI Program Execution</a>) are
always executed asynchronously in non-stop mode.

   <p>Suspending execution is done with the <code>interrupt</code> command when
running in the background, or <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> during foreground execution. 
In all-stop mode, this stops the whole process;
but in non-stop mode the interrupt applies only to the current thread. 
To stop the whole program, use <code>interrupt -a</code>.

   <p>Other execution commands do not currently support the <code>-a</code> option.

   <p>In non-stop mode, when a thread stops, <span class="sc">gdb</span> doesn't automatically make
that thread current, as it does in all-stop mode.  This is because the
thread stop notifications are asynchronous with respect to <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
command interpreter, and it would be confusing if <span class="sc">gdb</span> unexpectedly
changed to a different thread just as you entered a command to operate on the
previously current thread.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.3 Background Execution</h4>

<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s execution commands have two variants:  the normal
foreground (synchronous) behavior, and a background
(asynchronous) behavior.  In foreground execution, <span class="sc">gdb</span> waits for
the program to report that some thread has stopped before prompting for
another command.  In background execution, <span class="sc">gdb</span> immediately gives
a command prompt so that you can issue other commands while your program runs.

   <p>If the target doesn't support async mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span> issues an error
message if you attempt to use the background execution commands.

   <p>To specify background execution, add a <code>&amp;</code> to the command.  For example,
the background form of the <code>continue</code> command is <code>continue&amp;</code>, or
just <code>c&amp;</code>.  The execution commands that accept background execution
are:

   </dl>

   <p>Background execution is especially useful in conjunction with non-stop
mode for debugging programs with multiple threads; see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>. 
However, you can also use these commands in the normal all-stop mode with
the restriction that you cannot issue another execution command until the
previous one finishes.  Examples of commands that are valid in all-stop
mode while the program is running include <code>help</code> and <code>info break</code>.

   <p>You can interrupt your program while it is running in the background by
using the <code>interrupt</code> command.

     
<a name="index-interrupt-401"></a>
<dl><dt><code>interrupt</code><dt><code>interrupt -a</code><dd>
Suspend execution of the running program.  In all-stop mode,
<code>interrupt</code> stops the whole process, but in non-stop mode, it stops
only the current thread.  To stop the whole program in non-stop mode,
use <code>interrupt -a</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.4 Thread-Specific Breakpoints</h4>

<p>When your program has multiple threads (see <a href="#Threads">Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</a>), you can choose whether to set
breakpoints on all threads, or on a particular thread.

     
<a name="index-breakpoints-and-threads-402"></a>
<a name="index-thread-breakpoints-403"></a>

writing them (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), but the effect is always to
specify some source line.

     <p>Use the qualifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>&rsquo; with a breakpoint command
to specify that you only want <span class="sc">gdb</span> to stop the program when a
particular thread reaches this breakpoint.  The <var>threadno</var> specifier
is one of the numeric thread identifiers assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, shown
in the first column of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>&rsquo; display.

     <p>If you do not specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>&rsquo; when you set a
breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to <em>all</em> threads of your
program.

     <p>You can use the <code>thread</code> qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
well; in this case, place &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>&rsquo; before or
after the breakpoint condition, like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) break frik.c:13 thread 28 if bartab &gt; lim
</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>Thread-specific breakpoints are automatically deleted when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> detects the corresponding thread is no longer in the
thread list.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) c
     Thread-specific breakpoint 3 deleted - thread 28 no longer in the thread list.
</pre>
   <p>There are several ways for a thread to disappear, such as a regular
thread exit, but also when you detach from the process with the
<code>detach</code> command (see <a href="#Attach">Debugging an Already-running Process</a>), or if <span class="sc">gdb</span> loses the remote connection
(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), etc.  Note that with some targets,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is only able to detect a thread has exited when the user
explictly asks for the thread list with the <code>info threads</code>
command.

multi-threaded programs.  If one thread stops for a
breakpoint, or for some other reason, and another thread is blocked in a
system call, then the system call may return prematurely.  This is a
consequence of the interaction between multiple threads and the signals
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to implement breakpoints and other events that
stop execution.

   <p>To handle this problem, your program should check the return value of
each system call and react appropriately.  This is good programming
style anyways.

   <p>For example, do not write code like this:

<pre class="smallexample">       sleep (10);
</pre>
   <p>The call to <code>sleep</code> will return early if a different thread stops
at a breakpoint or for some other reason.

   <p>Instead, write this:

<pre class="smallexample">       int unslept = 10;
       while (unslept &gt; 0)
         unslept = sleep (unslept);
</pre>
   <p>A system call is allowed to return early, so the system is still
conforming to its specification.  But <span class="sc">gdb</span> does cause your
multi-threaded program to behave differently than it would without
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>Also, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses internal breakpoints in the thread library to
monitor certain events such as thread creation and thread destruction. 
When such an event happens, a system call in another thread may return
prematurely, even though your program does not appear to stop.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.6 Observer Mode</h4>

<p>If you want to build on non-stop mode and observe program behavior
without any chance of disruption by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, you can set
variables to disable all of the debugger's attempts to modify state,
whether by writing memory, inserting breakpoints, etc.  These operate
at a low level, intercepting operations from all commands.

   <p>When all of these are set to <code>off</code>, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> is said to
be <dfn>observer mode</dfn>.  As a convenience, the variable
<code>observer</code> can be set to disable these, plus enable non-stop
mode.

   <p>Note that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not prevent you from making nonsensical
combinations of these settings. For instance, if you have enabled
<code>may-insert-breakpoints</code> but disabled <code>may-write-memory</code>,
then breakpoints that work by writing trap instructions into the code
stream will still not be able to be placed.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Running programs backward</h2>

<p><a name="index-reverse-execution-415"></a><a name="index-running-programs-backward-416"></a>
When you are debugging a program, it is not unusual to realize that
you have gone too far, and some event of interest has already happened. 
If the target environment supports it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can allow you to
&ldquo;rewind&rdquo; the program by running it backward.

   <p>A target environment that supports reverse execution should be able
to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; the changes in machine state that have taken place as the
program was executing normally.  Variables, registers etc. should
revert to their previous values.  Obviously this requires a great
deal of sophistication on the part of the target environment; not
all target environments can support reverse execution.

   <p>When a program is executed in reverse, the instructions that
have most recently been executed are &ldquo;un-executed&rdquo;, in reverse
order.  The program counter runs backward, following the previous
thread of execution in reverse.  As each instruction is &ldquo;un-executed&rdquo;,
the values of memory and/or registers that were changed by that
instruction are reverted to their previous states.  After executing
a piece of source code in reverse, all side effects of that code
should be &ldquo;undone&rdquo;, and all variables should be returned to their
prior values<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>.

   <p>If you are debugging in a target environment that supports
reverse execution, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following commands.

     
<a name="index-reverse_002dcontinue-417"></a>
<a name="index-rc-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007breverse_002dcontinue_007d_0029_007d-418"></a>
<dl><dt><code>reverse-continue </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>ignore-count</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>rc </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>ignore-count</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Beginning at the point where your program last stopped, start executing
in reverse.  Reverse execution will stop for breakpoints and synchronous

asynchronous signals depends on the target environment.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Recording Inferior's Execution and Replaying It</h2>

<p><a name="index-process-record-and-replay-430"></a><a name="index-recording-inferior_0027s-execution-and-replaying-it-431"></a>
On some platforms, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a special <dfn>process record
and replay</dfn> target that can record a log of the process execution, and
replay it later with both forward and reverse execution commands.

   <p><a name="index-replay-mode-432"></a>When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record
for the next instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>replay
mode</dfn>.  In the replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code
instructions.  Instead, all the events that normally happen during
code execution are taken from the execution log.  While code is not
really executed in replay mode, the values of registers (including the
program counter register) and the memory of the inferior are still
changed as they normally would.  Their contents are taken from the
execution log.

   <p><a name="index-record-mode-433"></a>If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will debug in <dfn>record mode</dfn>.  In this mode, the
inferior executes normally, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> records the execution log
for future replay.

   <p>The process record and replay target supports reverse execution
(see <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>), even if the platform on which the
inferior runs does not.  However, the reverse execution is limited in
this case by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution
log.  In other words, reverse execution on platforms that don't
support it directly can only be done in the replay mode.

   <p>When debugging in the reverse direction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will work in
replay mode as long as the execution log includes the record for the
previous instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the
platform supports reverse execution, or stop if not.

   <p>For architecture environments that support process record and replay,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following commands:

     
<a name="index-target-record-434"></a>

<a name="index-rec-pt-450"></a>
<dl><dt><code>record </code><var>method</var><dd>This command starts the process record and replay target.  The
recording method can be specified as parameter.  Without a parameter
the command uses the <code>full</code> recording method.  The following
recording methods are available:

          <dl>
<dt><code>full</code><dd>Full record/replay recording using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s software record and
replay implementation.  This method allows replaying and reverse
execution.

          <br><dt><code>btrace </code><var>format</var><dd>Hardware-supported instruction recording.  This method does not record
data.  Further, the data is collected in a ring buffer so old data will
be overwritten when the buffer is full.  It allows limited reverse
execution.  Variables and registers are not available during reverse
execution.

          <p>The recording format can be specified as parameter.  Without a parameter
the command chooses the recording format.  The following recording
formats are available:

               <dl>
<dt><code>bts</code><dd><a name="index-branch-trace-store-451"></a>Use the <dfn>Branch Trace Store</dfn> (<acronym>BTS</acronym>) recording format.  In
this format, the processor stores a from/to record for each executed
branch in the btrace ring buffer.

               <br><dt><code>pt</code><dd><a name="index-Intel_0028R_0029-Processor-Trace-452"></a>Use the <dfn>Intel(R) Processor Trace</dfn> recording format.  In this
format, the processor stores the execution trace in a compressed form
that is afterwards decoded by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

               <p>The trace can be recorded with very low overhead.  The compressed
trace format also allows small trace buffers to already contain a big
number of instructions compared to <acronym>BTS</acronym>.

               <p>Decoding the recorded execution trace, on the other hand, is more
expensive than decoding <acronym>BTS</acronym> trace.  This is mostly due to the
increased number of instructions to process.  You should increase the
buffer-size with care. 
</dl>

          <p>Not all recording formats may be available on all processors. 
</dl>

     <p>The process record and replay target can only debug a process that is
already running.  Therefore, you need first to start the process with
the <kbd>run</kbd> or <kbd>start</kbd> commands, and then start the recording
with the <kbd>record </kbd><var>method</var> command.

     <p><a name="index-displaced-stepping_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-453"></a>Displaced stepping (see <a href="#Maintenance-Commands">displaced stepping</a>)
will be automatically disabled when process record and replay target
is started.  That's because the process record and replay target
doesn't support displaced stepping.

     <p><a name="index-non_002dstop-mode_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-454"></a><a name="index-asynchronous-execution_002c-and-process-record-and-replay-455"></a>If the inferior is in the non-stop mode (see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) or in
the asynchronous execution mode (see <a href="#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>), not
all recording methods are available.  The <code>full</code> recording method
does not support these two modes.

     <p><a name="index-record-stop-456"></a><a name="index-rec-s-457"></a><br><dt><code>record stop</code><dd>Stop the process record and replay target.  When process record and
replay target stops, the entire execution log will be deleted and the
inferior will either be terminated, or will remain in its final state.

     <p>When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode (at
the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at the
next instruction that would have been recorded.  In other words, if
you record for a while and then stop recording, the inferior process
will be left in the same state as if the recording never happened.

     <p>On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is stopped
while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the execution log,
but at some earlier point), the inferior process will become &ldquo;live&rdquo;
at that earlier state, and it will then be possible to continue the
usual &ldquo;live&rdquo; debugging of the process from that state.

     <p>When the inferior process exits, or <span class="sc">gdb</span> detaches from it,
process record and replay target will automatically stop itself.

     <p><a name="index-record-goto-458"></a><br><dt><code>record goto</code><dd>Go to a specific location in the execution log.  There are several

<var>process_id</var> is the process ID of the inferior.

     <p>This command may not be available for all recording methods.

     <p><a name="index-record-restore-460"></a><br><dt><code>record restore </code><var>filename</var><dd>Restore the execution log from a file <samp><var>filename</var></samp>.

recording method.  Default value is 200000.

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is a positive number, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will start
deleting instructions from the log once the number of the record
instructions becomes greater than <var>limit</var>.  For every new recorded
instruction, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will delete the earliest recorded
instruction to keep the number of recorded instructions at the limit. 
(Since deleting recorded instructions loses information, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
lets you control what happens when the limit is reached, by means of
the <code>stop-at-limit</code> option, described below.)

     <p>If <var>limit</var> is <code>unlimited</code> or zero, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will never
delete recorded instructions from the execution log.  The number of
recorded instructions is limited only by the available memory.

     <p><a name="index-show-record-full-462"></a><br><dt><code>show record full insn-number-max</code><dd>Show the limit of instructions to be recorded with the <code>full</code>

number of recorded instructions reaches the limit.  If ON (the
default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will stop when the limit is reached for the
first time and ask you whether you want to stop the inferior or
continue running it and recording the execution log.  If you decide
to continue recording, each new recorded instruction will cause the
oldest one to be deleted.

     <p>If this option is OFF, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically delete the
oldest record to make room for each new one, without asking.

     <br><dt><code>show record full stop-at-limit</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>stop-at-limit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set record full memory-query</code><dd>Control the behavior when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is unable to record memory
changes caused by an instruction for the <code>full</code> recording method. 
If ON, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will query whether to stop the inferior in that
case.

     <p>If this option is OFF (the default), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will automatically
ignore the effect of such instructions on memory.  Later, when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> replays this execution log, it will mark the log of this
instruction as not accessible, and it will not affect the replay
results.

     <br><dt><code>show record full memory-query</code><dd>Show the current setting of <code>memory-query</code>.

     <p><a name="index-set-record-btrace-463"></a>The <code>btrace</code> record target does not trace data.  As a
convenience, when replaying, <span class="sc">gdb</span> reads read-only memory off
the live program directly, assuming that the addresses of the
read-only areas don't change.  This for example makes it possible to
disassemble code while replaying, but not to print variables. 
In some cases, being able to inspect variables might be useful. 
You can use the following command for that:

     <br><dt><code>set record btrace replay-memory-access</code><dd>Control the behavior of the <code>btrace</code> recording method when
accessing memory during replay.  If <code>read-only</code> (the default),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will only allow accesses to read-only memory. 
If <code>read-write</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will allow accesses to read-only
and to read-write memory.  Beware that the accessed memory corresponds
to the live target and not necessarily to the current replay
position.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Examining the Stack</h2>

<p>When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where it
stopped and how it got there.

   <p><a name="index-call-stack-476"></a>Each time your program performs a function call, information about the call
is generated. 
That information includes the location of the call in your program,
the arguments of the call,
and the local variables of the function being called. 
The information is saved in a block of data called a <dfn>stack frame</dfn>. 
The stack frames are allocated in a region of memory called the <dfn>call
stack</dfn>.

   <p>When your program stops, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands for examining the
stack allow you to see all of this information.

   <p><a name="index-selected-frame-477"></a>One of the stack frames is <dfn>selected</dfn> by <span class="sc">gdb</span> and many
<span class="sc">gdb</span> commands refer implicitly to the selected frame.  In
particular, whenever you ask <span class="sc">gdb</span> for the value of a variable in
your program, the value is found in the selected frame.  There are
special <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands to select whichever frame you are
interested in.  See <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>.

   <p>When your program stops, <span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically selects the
currently executing frame and describes it briefly, similar to the
<code>frame</code> command (see <a href="#Frame-Info">Information about a Frame</a>).

<h3 class="section">8.1 Stack Frames</h3>

<p><a name="index-frame_002c-definition-478"></a><a name="index-stack-frame-479"></a>The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called <dfn>stack
frames</dfn>, or <dfn>frames</dfn> for short; each frame is the data associated
with one call to one function.  The frame contains the arguments given
to the function, the function's local variables, and the address at
which the function is executing.

   <p><a name="index-initial-frame-480"></a><a name="index-outermost-frame-481"></a><a name="index-innermost-frame-482"></a>When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the
function <code>main</code>.  This is called the <dfn>initial</dfn> frame or the
<dfn>outermost</dfn> frame.  Each time a function is called, a new frame is
made.  Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation
is eliminated.  If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for
the same function.  The frame for the function in which execution is
actually occurring is called the <dfn>innermost</dfn> frame.  This is the most
recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.

   <p><a name="index-frame-pointer-483"></a>Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses.  A
stack frame consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address; each
kind of computer has a convention for choosing one byte whose
address serves as the address of the frame.  Usually this address is kept
in a register called the <dfn>frame pointer register</dfn>
(see <a href="#Registers">$fp</a>) while execution is going on in that frame.

   <p><a name="index-frame-number-484"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> assigns numbers to all existing stack frames, starting with
zero for the innermost frame, one for the frame that called it,
and so on upward.  These numbers do not really exist in your program;
they are assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span> to give you a way of designating stack
frames in <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands.

<!-- The -fomit-frame-pointer below perennially causes hbox overflow -->
<!-- underflow problems. -->
   <p><a name="index-frameless-execution-485"></a>Some compilers provide a way to compile functions so that they operate
without stack frames.  (For example, the <span class="sc">gcc</span> option
<pre class="smallexample">     &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fomit-frame-pointer</span></samp>&rsquo;
</pre>
   <p>generates functions without a frame.) 
This is occasionally done with heavily used library functions to save
the frame setup time.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> has limited facilities for dealing
with these function invocations.  If the innermost function invocation
has no stack frame, <span class="sc">gdb</span> nevertheless regards it as though
it had a separate frame, which is numbered zero as usual, allowing
correct tracing of the function call chain.  However, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
no provision for frameless functions elsewhere in the stack.

<h3 class="section">8.2 Backtraces</h3>

<p><a name="index-traceback-490"></a><a name="index-call-stack-traces-491"></a>A backtrace is a summary of how your program got where it is.  It shows one
line per frame, for many frames, starting with the currently executing
frame (frame zero), followed by its caller (frame one), and on up the
stack.

   <p><a name="backtrace_002dcommand"></a>
     
<a name="index-backtrace-492"></a>

<dl><dt><code>backtrace</code><dt><code>bt</code><dd>Print a backtrace of the entire stack: one line per frame for all
frames in the stack.

     <p>You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system interrupt
character, normally <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>backtrace </code><var>n</var><dt><code>bt </code><var>n</var><dd>Similar, but print only the innermost <var>n</var> frames.

See <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>, for more information.  Additionally use <a href="#disable-frame_002dfilter-all">disable frame-filter all</a> to turn off all frame filters.  This is only
relevant when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been configured with <code>Python</code>
support. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-where-494"></a><a name="index-info-stack-495"></a>The names <code>where</code> and <code>info stack</code> (abbreviated <code>info s</code>)
are additional aliases for <code>backtrace</code>.

   <p><a name="index-multiple-threads_002c-backtrace-496"></a>In a multi-threaded program, <span class="sc">gdb</span> by default shows the
backtrace only for the current thread.  To display the backtrace for
several or all of the threads, use the command <code>thread apply</code>
(see <a href="#Threads">thread apply</a>).  For example, if you type <kbd>thread
apply all backtrace</kbd>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will display the backtrace for all
the threads; this is handy when you debug a core dump of a
multi-threaded program.

   <p>Each line in the backtrace shows the frame number and the function name. 
The program counter value is also shown&mdash;unless you use <code>set
print address off</code>.  The backtrace also shows the source file name and
line number, as well as the arguments to the function.  The program
counter value is omitted if it is at the beginning of the code for that
line number.

   <p>Here is an example of a backtrace.  It was made with the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bt 3</span></samp>&rsquo;, so it shows the innermost three frames.

<pre class="smallexample">     #0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
         at builtin.c:993
     #1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=0x2b600, data=...) at macro.c:242
     #2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=177664, td=0xf7fffb08)
         at macro.c:71
     (More stack frames follow...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The display for frame zero does not begin with a program counter
value, indicating that your program has stopped at the beginning of the
code for line <code>993</code> of <code>builtin.c</code>.

<p class="noindent">The value of parameter <code>data</code> in frame 1 has been replaced by
<code>...</code>.  By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints the value of a parameter
only if it is a scalar (integer, pointer, enumeration, etc).  See command
<kbd>set print frame-arguments</kbd> in <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a> for more details
on how to configure the way function parameter values are printed.

   <p><a name="index-optimized-out_002c-in-backtrace-497"></a><a name="index-function-call-arguments_002c-optimized-out-498"></a>If your program was compiled with optimizations, some compilers will
optimize away arguments passed to functions if those arguments are
never used after the call.  Such optimizations generate code that
passes arguments through registers, but doesn't store those arguments
in the stack frame.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> has no way of displaying such
arguments in stack frames other than the innermost one.  Here's what
such a backtrace might look like:

<pre class="smallexample">     #0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
         at builtin.c:993
     #1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at macro.c:242
     #2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=&lt;optimized out&gt;, td=0xf7fffb08)
         at macro.c:71
     (More stack frames follow...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The values of arguments that were not saved in their stack frames are
shown as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;optimized out&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If you need to display the values of such optimized-out arguments,
either deduce that from other variables whose values depend on the one
you are interested in, or recompile without optimizations.

   <p><a name="index-backtrace-beyond-_0040code_007bmain_007d-function-499"></a><a name="index-program-entry-point-500"></a><a name="index-startup-code_002c-and-backtrace-501"></a>Most programs have a standard user entry point&mdash;a place where system
libraries and startup code transition into user code.  For C this is
<code>main</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>. 
When <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds the entry function in a backtrace
it will terminate the backtrace, to avoid tracing into highly
system-specific (and generally uninteresting) code.

   <p>If you need to examine the startup code, or limit the number of levels
in a backtrace, you can change this behavior:

     <dl>
<dt><code>set backtrace past-main</code><dt><code>set backtrace past-main on</code><dd><a name="index-set-backtrace-502"></a>Backtraces will continue past the user entry point.

     <br><dt><code>set backtrace past-main off</code><dd>Backtraces will stop when they encounter the user entry point.  This is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>show backtrace past-main</code><dd><a name="index-show-backtrace-503"></a>Display the current user entry point backtrace policy.

     <br><dt><code>set backtrace past-entry</code><dt><code>set backtrace past-entry on</code><dd>Backtraces will continue past the internal entry point of an application. 
This entry point is encoded by the linker when the application is built,
and is likely before the user entry point <code>main</code> (or equivalent) is called.

     <br><dt><code>set backtrace past-entry off</code><dd>Backtraces will stop when they encounter the internal entry point of an
application.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>show backtrace past-entry</code><dd>Display the current internal entry point backtrace policy.

or zero means unlimited levels.

     <br><dt><code>show backtrace limit</code><dd>Display the current limit on backtrace levels. 
</dl>

   <p>You can control how file names are displayed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set filename-display</code><dt><code>set filename-display relative</code><dd><a name="index-filename_002ddisplay-505"></a>Display file names relative to the compilation directory.  This is the default.

Frame filters are Python based utilities to manage and decorate the
output of frames.  See <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>, for further information.

   <p>Managing frame filters is performed by several commands available
within <span class="sc">gdb</span>, detailed here.

dictionary resides.  When <code>all</code> is specified, all frame filters
across all dictionaries are disabled.  The <var>filter-name</var> is the name
of the frame filter and is used when <code>all</code> is not the option for

     <br><dt><code>frame </code><var>stack-addr</var><code> [ </code><var>pc-addr</var><code> ]</code><dt><code>f </code><var>stack-addr</var><code> [ </code><var>pc-addr</var><code> ]</code><dd>Select the frame at address <var>stack-addr</var>.  This is useful mainly if the
chaining of stack frames has been damaged by a bug, making it
impossible for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to assign numbers properly to all frames.  In
addition, this can be useful when your program has multiple stacks and
switches between them.  The optional <var>pc-addr</var> can also be given to
specify the value of PC for the stack frame.

     <p><a name="index-up-514"></a><br><dt><code>up </code><var>n</var><dd>Move <var>n</var> frames up the stack; <var>n</var> defaults to 1.  For positive
numbers <var>n</var>, this advances toward the outermost frame, to higher
frame numbers, to frames that have existed longer.

     <p><a name="index-down-515"></a><a name="index-do-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007bdown_007d_0029_007d-516"></a><br><dt><code>down </code><var>n</var><dd>Move <var>n</var> frames down the stack; <var>n</var> defaults to 1.  For
positive numbers <var>n</var>, this advances toward the innermost frame, to
lower frame numbers, to frames that were created more recently. 
You may abbreviate <code>down</code> as <code>do</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>All of these commands end by printing two lines of output describing the
frame.  The first line shows the frame number, the function name, the
arguments, and the source file and line number of execution in that
frame.  The second line shows the text of that source line.

   <p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) up
     #1  0x22f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0xf7fffbf4, env=0xf7fffbfc)
         at env.c:10
     10              read_input_file (argv[i]);
</pre>
   <p>After such a printout, the <code>list</code> command with no arguments
prints ten lines centered on the point of execution in the frame. 
You can also edit the program at the point of execution with your favorite
editing program by typing <code>edit</code>. 
See <a href="#List">Printing Source Lines</a>,
for details.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Examining Source Files</h2>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can print parts of your program's source, since the debugging
information recorded in the program tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> what source files were
used to build it.  When your program stops, <span class="sc">gdb</span> spontaneously prints
the line where it stopped.  Likewise, when you select a stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>), <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints the line where
execution in that frame has stopped.  You can print other portions of
source files by explicit command.

   <p>If you use <span class="sc">gdb</span> through its <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs interface, you may
prefer to use Emacs facilities to view source; see <a href="#Emacs">Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> under <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs</a>.

<h3 class="section">9.1 Printing Source Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-list-523"></a><a name="index-l-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007blist_007d_0029_007d-524"></a>To print lines from a source file, use the <code>list</code> command
(abbreviated <code>l</code>).  By default, ten lines are printed. 
There are several ways to specify what part of the file you want to
print; see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for the full list.

   <p>Here are the forms of the <code>list</code> command most commonly used:

     <dl>
<dt><code>list </code><var>linenum</var><dd>Print lines centered around line number <var>linenum</var> in the
current source file.

     <br><dt><code>list </code><var>function</var><dd>Print lines centered around the beginning of function
<var>function</var>.

     <br><dt><code>list</code><dd>Print more lines.  If the last lines printed were printed with a
<code>list</code> command, this prints lines following the last lines
printed; however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed
as part of displaying a stack frame (see <a href="#Stack">Examining the Stack</a>), this prints lines centered around that line.

     <br><dt><code>list -</code><dd>Print lines just before the lines last printed. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blist_007d_002c-how-many-lines-to-display-525"></a>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints ten source lines with any of these forms of
the <code>list</code> command.  You can change this using <code>set listsize</code>:

     
<a name="index-set-listsize-526"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set listsize </code><var>count</var><dt><code>set listsize unlimited</code><dd>Make the <code>list</code> command display <var>count</var> source lines (unless
the <code>list</code> argument explicitly specifies some other number). 
Setting <var>count</var> to <code>unlimited</code> or 0 means there's no limit.

     <p><a name="index-show-listsize-527"></a><br><dt><code>show listsize</code><dd>Display the number of lines that <code>list</code> prints. 
</dl>

   <p>Repeating a <code>list</code> command with &lt;RET&gt; discards the argument,
so it is equivalent to typing just <code>list</code>.  This is more useful
than listing the same lines again.  An exception is made for an
argument of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;; that argument is preserved in repetition so that
each repetition moves up in the source file.

   <p>In general, the <code>list</code> command expects you to supply zero, one or two
<dfn>linespecs</dfn>.  Linespecs specify source lines; there are several ways
of writing them (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), but the effect is always
to specify some source line.

   <p>Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for <code>list</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>list </code><var>linespec</var><dd>Print lines centered around the line specified by <var>linespec</var>.

     <br><dt><code>list </code><var>first</var><code>,</code><var>last</var><dd>Print lines from <var>first</var> to <var>last</var>.  Both arguments are
linespecs.  When a <code>list</code> command has two linespecs, and the
source file of the second linespec is omitted, this refers to
the same source file as the first linespec.

     <br><dt><code>list ,</code><var>last</var><dd>Print lines ending with <var>last</var>.

     <br><dt><code>list </code><var>first</var><code>,</code><dd>Print lines starting with <var>first</var>.

     <br><dt><code>list +</code><dd>Print lines just after the lines last printed.

     <br><dt><code>list -</code><dd>Print lines just before the lines last printed.

     <br><dt><code>list</code><dd>As described in the preceding table.

<h3 class="section">9.2 Specifying a Location</h3>

<p><a name="index-specifying-location-528"></a><a name="index-linespec-529"></a>
Several <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands accept arguments that specify a location
of your program's code.  Since <span class="sc">gdb</span> is a source-level
debugger, a location usually specifies some line in the source code;
for that reason, locations are also known as <dfn>linespecs</dfn>.

   <p>Here are all the different ways of specifying a code location that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> understands:

     <dl>
<dt><var>linenum</var><dd>Specifies the line number <var>linenum</var> of the current source file.

     <br><dt><code>-</code><var>offset</var><dt><code>+</code><var>offset</var><dd>Specifies the line <var>offset</var> lines before or after the <dfn>current
line</dfn>.  For the <code>list</code> command, the current line is the last one
printed; for the breakpoint commands, this is the line at which
execution stopped in the currently selected <dfn>stack frame</dfn>
(see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>, for a description of stack frames.)  When
used as the second of the two linespecs in a <code>list</code> command,
this specifies the line <var>offset</var> lines up or down from the first
linespec.

     <br><dt><var>filename</var><code>:</code><var>linenum</var><dd>Specifies the line <var>linenum</var> in the source file <var>filename</var>. 
If <var>filename</var> is a relative file name, then it will match any
source file name with the same trailing components.  For example, if
<var>filename</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc/expr.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, then it will match source file
name of <samp><span class="file">/build/trunk/gcc/expr.c</span></samp>, but not
<samp><span class="file">/build/trunk/libcpp/expr.c</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/build/trunk/gcc/x-expr.c</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><var>function</var><dd>Specifies the line that begins the body of the function <var>function</var>. 
For example, in C, this is the line with the open brace.

     <br><dt><var>function</var><code>:</code><var>label</var><dd>Specifies the line where <var>label</var> appears in <var>function</var>.

     <br><dt><var>filename</var><code>:</code><var>function</var><dd>Specifies the line that begins the body of the function <var>function</var>
in the file <var>filename</var>.  You only need the file name with a
function name to avoid ambiguity when there are identically named
functions in different source files.

     <br><dt><var>label</var><dd>Specifies the line at which the label named <var>label</var> appears. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> searches for the label in the function corresponding to
the currently selected stack frame.  If there is no current selected
stack frame (for instance, if the inferior is not running), then
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will not search for a label.

     <br><dt><code>*</code><var>address</var><dd>Specifies the program address <var>address</var>.  For line-oriented
commands, such as <code>list</code> and <code>edit</code>, this specifies a source
line that contains <var>address</var>.  For <code>break</code> and other
breakpoint oriented commands, this can be used to set breakpoints in
parts of your program which do not have debugging information or
source files.

     <p>Here <var>address</var> may be any expression valid in the current working
language (see <a href="#Languages">working language</a>) that specifies a code
address.  In addition, as a convenience, <span class="sc">gdb</span> extends the
semantics of expressions used in locations to cover the situations
that frequently happen during debugging.  Here are the various forms
of <var>address</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><var>expression</var><dd>Any expression valid in the current working language.

          <br><dt><var>funcaddr</var><dd>An address of a function or procedure derived from its name.  In C,
C<tt>++</tt>, Java, Objective-C, Fortran, minimal, and assembly, this is
simply the function's name <var>function</var> (and actually a special case
of a valid expression).  In Pascal and Modula-2, this is
<code>&amp;</code><var>function</var>.  In Ada, this is <var>function</var><code>'Address</code>
(although the Pascal form also works).

          <p>This form specifies the address of the function's first instruction,
before the stack frame and arguments have been set up.

          <br><dt><code>'</code><var>filename</var><code>':</code><var>funcaddr</var><dd>Like <var>funcaddr</var> above, but also specifies the name of the source
file explicitly.  This is useful if the name of the function does not
specify the function unambiguously, e.g., if there are several
functions with identical names in different source files. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-breakpoint-at-static-probe-point-530"></a><br><dt><code>-pstap|-probe-stap </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>objfile</var><code>:</code><span class="roman">[</span><var>provider</var><code>:</code><span class="roman">]</span><span class="roman">]</span><var>name</var><dd>The <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux tool <code>SystemTap</code> provides a way for
applications to embed static probes.  See <a href="#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>, for more
information on finding and using static probes.  This form of linespec
specifies the location of such a static probe.

     <p>If <var>objfile</var> is given, only probes coming from that shared library
or executable matching <var>objfile</var> as a regular expression are considered. 
If <var>provider</var> is given, then only probes from that provider are considered. 
If several probes match the spec, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will insert a breakpoint at
each one of those probes.

The editing program of your choice
is invoked with the current line set to
the active line in the program. 
Alternatively, there are several ways to specify what part of the file you
want to print if you want to see other parts of the program:

     <dl>
<dt><code>edit </code><var>location</var><dd>Edit the source file specified by <code>location</code>.  Editing starts at
that <var>location</var>, e.g., at the specified source line of the
specified file.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for all the possible forms
of the <var>location</var> argument; here are the forms of the <code>edit</code>
command most commonly used:

          <dl>
<dt><code>edit </code><var>number</var><dd>Edit the current source file with <var>number</var> as the active line number.

          <br><dt><code>edit </code><var>function</var><dd>Edit the file containing <var>function</var> at the beginning of its definition.

<pre class="smallexample">     EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
     export EDITOR

<h3 class="section">9.5 Specifying Source Directories</h3>

<p><a name="index-source-path-539"></a><a name="index-directories-for-source-files-540"></a>Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the source
files from which they were compiled, just the names.  Even when they do,
the directories could be moved between the compilation and your debugging
session.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> has a list of directories to search for source files;
this is called the <dfn>source path</dfn>.  Each time <span class="sc">gdb</span> wants a source file,
it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are present
in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.

   <p>For example, suppose an executable references the file
<samp><span class="file">/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</span></samp>, and our source path is
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp>.  The file is first looked up literally; if this
fails, <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</span></samp> is tried; if this
fails, <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/foo.c</span></samp> is opened; if this fails, an error
message is printed.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not look up the parts of the
source file name, such as <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</span></samp>. 
Likewise, the subdirectories of the source path are not searched: if
the source path is <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp>, and the binary refers to
<samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> would not find it under
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib</span></samp>.

   <p>Plain file names, relative file names with leading directories, file
names containing dots, etc. are all treated as described above; for
instance, if the source path is <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp>, and the source file
is recorded as <samp><span class="file">../lib/foo.c</span></samp>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> would first try
<samp><span class="file">../lib/foo.c</span></samp>, then <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/../lib/foo.c</span></samp>, and after
that&mdash;<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/foo.c</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that the executable search path is <em>not</em> used to locate the
source files.

   <p>Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, <span class="sc">gdb</span> clears out
any information it has cached about where source files are found and where
each line is in the file.

   <p><a name="index-directory-541"></a><a name="index-dir-542"></a>When you start <span class="sc">gdb</span>, its source path includes only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdir</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cwd</span></samp>&rsquo;, in that order. 
To add other directories, use the <code>directory</code> command.

   <p>The search path is used to find both program source files and <span class="sc">gdb</span>
script files (read using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-command</span></samp>&rsquo; option and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">source</span></samp>&rsquo; command).

   <p>In addition to the source path, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a set of commands
that manage a list of source path substitution rules.  A <dfn>substitution
rule</dfn> specifies how to rewrite source directories stored in the program's
debug information in case the sources were moved to a different
directory between compilation and debugging.  A rule is made of
two strings, the first specifying what needs to be rewritten in
the path, and the second specifying how it should be rewritten. 
In <a href="#set-substitute_002dpath">set substitute-path</a>, we name these two parts <var>from</var> and
<var>to</var> respectively.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does a simple string replacement
of <var>from</var> with <var>to</var> at the start of the directory part of the
source file name, and uses that result instead of the original file
name to look up the sources.

   <p>Using the previous example, suppose the <samp><span class="file">foo-1.0</span></samp> tree has been
moved from <samp><span class="file">/usr/src</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp>, then you can tell
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to replace <samp><span class="file">/usr/src</span></samp> in all source path names with
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp>.  The first lookup will then be
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</span></samp> in place of the original location
of <samp><span class="file">/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</span></samp>.  To define a source path
substitution rule, use the <code>set substitute-path</code> command
(see <a href="#set-substitute_002dpath">set substitute-path</a>).

   <p>To avoid unexpected substitution results, a rule is applied only if the
<var>from</var> part of the directory name ends at a directory separator. 
For instance, a rule substituting  <samp><span class="file">/usr/source</span></samp> into
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/cross</span></samp> will be applied to <samp><span class="file">/usr/source/foo-1.0</span></samp> but
not to <samp><span class="file">/usr/sourceware/foo-2.0</span></samp>.  And because the substitution
is applied only at the beginning of the directory name, this rule will
not be applied to <samp><span class="file">/root/usr/source/baz.c</span></samp> either.

   <p>In many cases, you can achieve the same result using the <code>directory</code>
command.  However, <code>set substitute-path</code> can be more efficient in
the case where the sources are organized in a complex tree with multiple
subdirectories.  With the <code>directory</code> command, you need to add each
subdirectory of your project.  If you moved the entire tree while
preserving its internal organization, then <code>set substitute-path</code>
allows you to direct the debugger to all the sources with one single
command.

   <p><code>set substitute-path</code> is also more than just a shortcut command. 
The source path is only used if the file at the original location no
longer exists.  On the other hand, <code>set substitute-path</code> modifies
the debugger behavior to look at the rewritten location instead.  So, if
for any reason a source file that is not relevant to your executable is
located at the original location, a substitution rule is the only
method available to point <span class="sc">gdb</span> at the new location.

configuring <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with-relocated-sources=</span><var>dir</var></samp>&rsquo; option.  The <var>dir</var>
should be the name of a directory under <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s configured
prefix (set with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--exec-prefix</span></samp>&rsquo;), and
directory names in debug information under <var>dir</var> will be adjusted
automatically if the installed <span class="sc">gdb</span> is moved to a new
location.  This is useful if <span class="sc">gdb</span>, libraries or executables

     <p>In the case when more than one substitution rule have been defined,
the rules are evaluated one by one in the order where they have been

use the second rule to rewrite <samp><span class="file">/usr/src/lib/foo.c</span></samp> into
<samp><span class="file">/mnt/src/lib/foo.c</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>unset substitute-path [path]</code><dd><a name="index-unset-substitute_002dpath-557"></a>If a path is specified, search the current list of substitution rules

     <br><dt><code>show substitute-path [path]</code><dd><a name="index-show-substitute_002dpath-558"></a>If a path is specified, then print the source path substitution rule
which would rewrite that path, if any.

     <p>If no path is specified, then print all existing source path substitution
rules.

   </dl>

   <p>If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer of
interest, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong
versions of source.  You can correct the situation as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Use <code>directory</code> with no argument to reset the source path to its default value.

     <li>Use <code>directory</code> with suitable arguments to reinstall the
directories you want in the source path.  You can add all the
directories in one command.

You can use the command <code>info line</code> to map source lines to program
addresses (and vice versa), and the command <code>disassemble</code> to display
a range of addresses as machine instructions.  You can use the command
<code>set disassemble-next-line</code> to set whether to disassemble next
source line when execution stops.  When run under <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs
mode, the <code>info line</code> command causes the arrow to point to the
line specified.  Also, <code>info line</code> prints addresses in symbolic form as
well as hex.

   <p>For example, we can use <code>info line</code> to discover the location of
the object code for the first line of function
<code>m4_changequote</code>:

<dl><dt><code>disassemble</code><dt><code>disassemble /m</code><dt><code>disassemble /r</code><dd>This specialized command dumps a range of memory as machine
instructions.  It can also print mixed source+disassembly by specifying
the <code>/m</code> modifier and print the raw instructions in hex as well as
in symbolic form by specifying the <code>/r</code>. 
The default memory range is the function surrounding the
program counter of the selected frame.  A single argument to this
command is a program counter value; <span class="sc">gdb</span> dumps the function
surrounding this value.  When two arguments are given, they should
be separated by a comma, possibly surrounded by whitespace.  The
arguments specify a range of addresses to dump, in one of two forms:

          <dl>
<dt><var>start</var><code>,</code><var>end</var><dd>the addresses from <var>start</var> (inclusive) to <var>end</var> (exclusive)

<var>start</var><code>+</code><var>length</var> (exclusive). 
</dl>

     <p class="noindent">When 2 arguments are specified, the name of the function is also
printed (since there could be several functions in the given range).

     <p>The argument(s) can be any expression yielding a numeric value, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x32c4</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;main+10</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$pc - 8</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>If the range of memory being disassembled contains current program counter,
the instruction at that location is shown with a <code>=&gt;</code> marker. 
</dl>

   <p>The following example shows the disassembly of a range of addresses of
HP PA-RISC 2.0 code:

   <p>Addresses cannot be specified as a linespec (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>). 
So, for example, if you want to disassemble function <code>bar</code>

   <p>Some architectures have more than one commonly-used set of instruction
mnemonics or other syntax.

   <p>For programs that were dynamically linked and use shared libraries,
instructions that call functions or branch to locations in the shared
libraries might show a seemingly bogus location&mdash;it's actually a
location of the relocation table.  On some architectures, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
might be able to resolve these to actual function names.

<p><a name="index-printing-data-576"></a><a name="index-examining-data-577"></a><a name="index-print-578"></a><a name="index-inspect-579"></a>The usual way to examine data in your program is with the <code>print</code>
command (abbreviated <code>p</code>), or its synonym <code>inspect</code>.  It
evaluates and prints the value of an expression of the language your
program is written in (see <a href="#Languages">Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> with Different Languages</a>).  It may also print the expression using a
Python-based pretty-printer (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><code>print </code><var>expr</var><dt><code>print /</code><var>f</var> <var>expr</var><dd><var>expr</var> is an expression (in the source language).  By default the
value of <var>expr</var> is printed in a format appropriate to its data type;
you can choose a different format by specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span><var>f</var></samp>&rsquo;, where
<var>f</var> is a letter specifying the format; see <a href="#Output-Formats">Output Formats</a>.

     <br><dt><code>print</code><dt><code>print /</code><var>f</var><dd><a name="index-reprint-the-last-value-580"></a>If you omit <var>expr</var>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays the last value again (from the
<dfn>value history</dfn>; see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>).  This allows you to
conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative format. 
</dl>

   <p>A more low-level way of examining data is with the <code>x</code> command. 
It examines data in memory at a specified address and prints it in a
specified format.  See <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>.

   <p>If you are interested in information about types, or about how the
fields of a struct or a class are declared, use the <code>ptype </code><var>exp</var>
command rather than <code>print</code>.  See <a href="#Symbols">Examining the Symbol Table</a>.

   <p><a name="index-exploring-hierarchical-data-structures-581"></a><a name="index-explore-582"></a>Another way of examining values of expressions and type information is
through the Python extension command <code>explore</code> (available only if
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> build is configured with <code>--with-python</code>).  It
offers an interactive way to start at the highest level (or, the most
abstract level) of the data type of an expression (or, the data type
itself) and explore all the way down to leaf scalar values/fields
embedded in the higher level data types.

     <dl>
<dt><code>explore </code><var>arg</var><dd><var>arg</var> is either an expression (in the source language), or a type
visible in the current context of the program being debugged. 
</dl>

   <p>The working of the <code>explore</code> command can be illustrated with an
example.  If a data type <code>struct ComplexStruct</code> is defined in your
C program as

<pre class="smallexample">     struct SimpleStruct
     {
       int i;
       double d;
     };
     
     struct ComplexStruct
     {
       struct SimpleStruct *ss_p;
       int arr[10];
     };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">followed by variable declarations as

<pre class="smallexample">     struct SimpleStruct ss = { 10, 1.11 };
     struct ComplexStruct cs = { &amp;ss, { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then, the value of the variable <code>cs</code> can be explored using the
<code>explore</code> command as follows.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) explore cs
     The value of `cs' is a struct/class of type `struct ComplexStruct' with
     the following fields:

        arr = &lt;Enter 1 to explore this field of type `int [10]'&gt;
     
     Enter the field number of choice:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Since the fields of <code>cs</code> are not scalar values, you are being
prompted to chose the field you want to explore.  Let's say you choose
the field <code>ss_p</code> by entering <code>0</code>.  Then, since this field is a
pointer, you will be asked if it is pointing to a single value.  From
the declaration of <code>cs</code> above, it is indeed pointing to a single
value, hence you enter <code>y</code>.  If you enter <code>n</code>, then you will
be asked if it were pointing to an array of values, in which case this
field will be explored as if it were an array.

     SimpleStruct' with the following fields:
     
       i = 10 .. (Value of type `int')
       d = 1.1100000000000001 .. (Value of type `double')
     
     Press enter to return to parent value:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the field <code>arr</code> of <code>cs</code> was chosen for exploration by
entering <code>1</code> earlier, then since it is as array, you will be
prompted to enter the index of the element in the array that you want
to explore.

<pre class="smallexample">     `cs.arr' is an array of `int'.
     Enter the index of the element you want to explore in `cs.arr': 5
     
     `(cs.arr)[5]' is a scalar value of type `int'.
     
     (cs.arr)[5] = 4
     
     Press enter to return to parent value:
</pre>
   <p>In general, at any stage of exploration, you can go deeper towards the
leaf values by responding to the prompts appropriately, or hit the
return key to return to the enclosing data structure (the <i>higher</i>
level data structure).

   <p>Similar to exploring values, you can use the <code>explore</code> command to
explore types.  Instead of specifying a value (which is typically a
variable name or an expression valid in the current context of the
program being debugged), you specify a type name.  If you consider the
same example as above, your can explore the type
<code>struct ComplexStruct</code> by passing the argument
<code>struct ComplexStruct</code> to the <code>explore</code> command.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) explore struct ComplexStruct
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">By responding to the prompts appropriately in the subsequent interactive
session, you can explore the type <code>struct ComplexStruct</code> in a
manner similar to how the value <code>cs</code> was explored in the above
example.

   <p>The <code>explore</code> command also has two sub-commands,
<code>explore value</code> and <code>explore type</code>. The former sub-command is
a way to explicitly specify that value exploration of the argument is
being invoked, while the latter is a way to explicitly specify that type
exploration of the argument is being invoked.

     <dl>
<dt><code>explore value </code><var>expr</var><dd><a name="index-explore-value-583"></a>This sub-command of <code>explore</code> explores the value of the
expression <var>expr</var> (if <var>expr</var> is an expression valid in the
current context of the program being debugged).  The behavior of this
command is identical to that of the behavior of the <code>explore</code>
command being passed the argument <var>expr</var>.

     <br><dt><code>explore type </code><var>arg</var><dd><a name="index-explore-type-584"></a>This sub-command of <code>explore</code> explores the type of <var>arg</var> (if
<var>arg</var> is a type visible in the current context of program being

is an expression valid in the current context of the program being
debugged).  If <var>arg</var> is a type, then the behavior of this command is
identical to that of the <code>explore</code> command being passed the
argument <var>arg</var>.  If <var>arg</var> is an expression, then the behavior of
this command will be identical to that of the <code>explore</code> command
being passed the type of <var>arg</var> as the argument.

<h3 class="section">10.1 Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-expressions-585"></a><code>print</code> and many other <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands accept an expression and
compute its value.  Any kind of constant, variable or operator defined
by the programming language you are using is valid in an expression in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This includes conditional expressions, function calls,
casts, and string constants.  It also includes preprocessor macros, if
you compiled your program to include this information; see
<a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>.

   <p>Beware that nested functions usually need a context to be set up before
being called. Unfortunately, GDB currently has no knowledge of this
setup, and hence generally cannot call nested functions correctly. 
Therefore, the result of such a call is likely to be erroneous, and
may even crash the program being debugged.

   <p><a name="index-arrays-in-expressions-586"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports array constants in expressions input by
the user.  The syntax is {<var>element</var>, <var>element</var><small class="dots">...</small>}.  For example,
you can use the command <code>print {1, 2, 3}</code> to create an array
of three integers.  If you pass an array to a function or assign it
to a program variable, <span class="sc">gdb</span> copies the array to memory that
is <code>malloc</code>ed in the target program.

   <p>Because C is so widespread, most of the expressions shown in examples in
this manual are in C.  See <a href="#Languages">Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> with Different Languages</a>, for information on how to use expressions in other
languages.

   <p>In this section, we discuss operators that you can use in <span class="sc">gdb</span>
expressions regardless of your programming language.

   <p><a name="index-casts_002c-in-expressions-587"></a>Casts are supported in all languages, not just in C, because it is so
useful to cast a number into a pointer in order to examine a structure
at that address in memory. 
<!-- FIXME: casts supported-Mod2 true? -->

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports these operators, in addition to those common
to programming languages:

     <dl>
<dt><code>@</code><dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; is a binary operator for treating parts of memory as arrays. 
See <a href="#Arrays">Artificial Arrays</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>::</code><dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; allows you to specify a variable in terms of the file or
function where it is defined.  See <a href="#Variables">Program Variables</a>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040_007b_0040var_007btype_007d_0040_007d-588"></a><a name="index-type-casting-memory-589"></a><a name="index-memory_002c-viewing-as-typed-object-590"></a><a name="index-casts_002c-to-view-memory-591"></a><br><dt><code>{</code><var>type</var><code>} </code><var>addr</var><dd>Refers to an object of type <var>type</var> stored at address <var>addr</var> in
memory.  The address <var>addr</var> may be any expression whose value is
an integer or pointer (but parentheses are required around binary
operators, just as in a cast).  This construct is allowed regardless
of what kind of data is normally supposed to reside at <var>addr</var>.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Ambiguous Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-ambiguous-expressions-592"></a>
Expressions can sometimes contain some ambiguous elements.  For instance,
some programming languages (notably Ada, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C) permit
a single function name to be defined several times, for application in
different contexts.  This is called <dfn>overloading</dfn>.  Another example
involving Ada is generics.  A <dfn>generic package</dfn> is similar to C<tt>++</tt>
templates and is typically instantiated several times, resulting in
the same function name being defined in different contexts.

   <p>In some cases and depending on the language, it is possible to adjust
the expression to remove the ambiguity.  For instance in C<tt>++</tt>, you
can specify the signature of the function you want to break on, as in
<kbd>break </kbd><var>function</var><kbd>(</kbd><var>types</var><kbd>)</kbd>.  In Ada, using the fully
qualified name of your function often makes the expression unambiguous
as well.

   <p>When an ambiguity that needs to be resolved is detected, the debugger
has the capability to display a menu of numbered choices for each
possibility, and then waits for the selection with the prompt &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The first option is always &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0] cancel</span></samp>&rsquo;, and typing <kbd>0 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
aborts the current command.  If the command in which the expression was
used allows more than one choice to be selected, the next option in the
menu is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1] all</span></samp>&rsquo;, and typing <kbd>1 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> selects all possible
choices.

   <p>For example, the following session excerpt shows an attempt to set a
breakpoint at the overloaded symbol <code>String::after</code>. 
We choose three particular definitions of that function name:

<!-- FIXME! This is likely to change to show arg type lists, at least -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) b String::after
     [0] cancel
     [1] all
     [2] file:String.cc; line number:867
     [3] file:String.cc; line number:860
     [4] file:String.cc; line number:875
     [5] file:String.cc; line number:853
     [6] file:String.cc; line number:846
     [7] file:String.cc; line number:735
     &gt; 2 4 6
     Breakpoint 1 at 0xb26c: file String.cc, line 867.
     Breakpoint 2 at 0xb344: file String.cc, line 875.
     Breakpoint 3 at 0xafcc: file String.cc, line 846.
     Multiple breakpoints were set.
     Use the "delete" command to delete unwanted
      breakpoints.
     (gdb)
</pre>
     
<a name="index-set-multiple_002dsymbols-593"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set multiple-symbols </code><var>mode</var><dd><a name="index-multiple_002dsymbols-menu-594"></a>
This option allows you to adjust the debugger behavior when an expression
is ambiguous.

     <p>By default, <var>mode</var> is set to <code>all</code>.  If the command with which
the expression is used allows more than one choice, then <span class="sc">gdb</span>
automatically selects all possible choices.  For instance, inserting
a breakpoint on a function using an ambiguous name results in a breakpoint
inserted on each possible match.  However, if a unique choice must be made,
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the menu to help you disambiguate the expression. 
For instance, printing the address of an overloaded function will result
in the use of the menu.

     <p>When <var>mode</var> is set to <code>ask</code>, the debugger always uses the menu
when an ambiguity is detected.

     <p>Finally, when <var>mode</var> is set to <code>cancel</code>, the debugger reports
an error due to the ambiguity and the command is aborted.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Program Variables</h3>

<p>The most common kind of expression to use is the name of a variable
in your program.

   <p>Variables in expressions are understood in the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>); they must be either:

     <ul>
<li>global (or file-static)
</ul>

<p class="noindent">or

     <ul>
<li>visible according to the scope rules of the
programming language from the point of execution in that frame
</ul>

<p class="noindent">This means that in the function

<pre class="smallexample">     foo (a)
          int a;
     {
       bar (a);
       {
         int b = test ();
         bar (b);
       }
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you can examine and use the variable <code>a</code> whenever your program is
executing within the function <code>foo</code>, but you can only use or
examine the variable <code>b</code> while your program is executing inside
the block where <code>b</code> is declared.

   <p><a name="index-variable-name-conflict-596"></a>There is an exception: you can refer to a variable or function whose
scope is a single source file even if the current execution point is not
in this file.  But it is possible to have more than one such variable or
function with the same name (in different source files).  If that
happens, referring to that name has unpredictable effects.  If you wish,
you can specify a static variable in a particular function or file by
using the colon-colon (<code>::</code>) notation:

   <p><a name="index-colon_002dcolon_002c-context-for-variables_002ffunctions-597"></a><!-- info cannot cope with a :: index entry, but why deprive hard copy readers? -->
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_003a_003a_007d_002c-context-for-variables_002ffunctions-598"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     <var>file</var>::<var>variable</var>
     <var>function</var>::<var>variable</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <var>file</var> or <var>function</var> is the name of the context for the
static <var>variable</var>.  In the case of file names, you can use quotes to
make sure <span class="sc">gdb</span> parses the file name as a single word&mdash;for example,
to print a global value of <code>x</code> defined in <samp><span class="file">f2.c</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p 'f2.c'::x
</pre>
   <p>The <code>::</code> notation is normally used for referring to
static variables, since you typically disambiguate uses of local variables
in functions by selecting the appropriate frame and using the
simple name of the variable.  However, you may also use this notation
to refer to local variables in frames enclosing the selected frame:

<pre class="smallexample">     void
     foo (int a)
     {
       if (a &lt; 10)
         bar (a);
       else
         process (a);    /* Stop here */
     }
     
     int
     bar (int a)
     {
       foo (a + 5);
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, if there is a breakpoint at the commented line,
here is what you might see
when the program stops after executing the call <code>bar(0)</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p a
     $1 = 10
     (gdb) p bar::a
     $2 = 5
     (gdb) up 2
     #2  0x080483d0 in foo (a=5) at foobar.c:12
     (gdb) p a
     $3 = 5
     (gdb) p bar::a
     $4 = 0
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-scope-resolution-599"></a>These uses of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; are very rarely in conflict with the very
similar use of the same notation in C<tt>++</tt>.  When they are in
conflict, the C<tt>++</tt> meaning takes precedence; however, this can be
overridden by quoting the file or function name with single quotes.

   <p>For example, suppose the program is stopped in a method of a class
that has a field named <code>includefile</code>, and there is also an
include file named <samp><span class="file">includefile</span></samp> that defines a variable,
<code>some_global</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p includefile
     $1 = 23
     (gdb) p includefile::some_global
     A syntax error in expression, near `'.
     (gdb) p 'includefile'::some_global
     $2 = 27
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-wrong-values-600"></a><a name="index-variable-values_002c-wrong-601"></a><a name="index-function-entry_002fexit_002c-wrong-values-of-variables-602"></a><a name="index-optimized-code_002c-wrong-values-of-variables-603"></a><blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> Occasionally, a local variable may appear to have the
wrong value at certain points in a function&mdash;just after entry to a new
scope, and just before exit. 
</blockquote>
   You may see this problem when you are stepping by machine instructions. 
This is because, on most machines, it takes more than one instruction to
set up a stack frame (including local variable definitions); if you are
stepping by machine instructions, variables may appear to have the wrong
values until the stack frame is completely built.  On exit, it usually
also takes more than one machine instruction to destroy a stack frame;
after you begin stepping through that group of instructions, local
variable definitions may be gone.

   <p>This may also happen when the compiler does significant optimizations. 
To be sure of always seeing accurate values, turn off all optimization
when compiling.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0060_0060No-symbol-_0022foo_0022-in-current-context_0027_0027-604"></a>Another possible effect of compiler optimizations is to optimize
unused variables out of existence, or assign variables to registers (as
opposed to memory addresses).  Depending on the support for such cases
offered by the debug info format used by the compiler, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
might not be able to display values for such local variables.  If that
happens, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will print a message like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     No symbol "foo" in current context.
</pre>
   <p>To solve such problems, either recompile without optimizations, or use a
different debug info format, if the compiler supports several such
formats.  See <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>, for more information on choosing compiler
options.  See <a href="#C">C and C<tt>++</tt></a>, for more information about debug
info formats that are best suited to C<tt>++</tt> programs.

   <p>If you ask to print an object whose contents are unknown to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>, e.g., because its data type is not completely specified
by the debug information, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;incomplete
type&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="#Symbols">incomplete type</a>, for more about this.

   <p>If you append <kbd>@entry</kbd> string to a function parameter name you get its
value at the time the function got called.  If the value is not available an
error message is printed.  Entry values are available only with some compilers. 
Entry values are normally also printed at the function parameter list according
to <a href="#set-print-entry_002dvalues">set print entry-values</a>.

<pre class="smallexample">     Breakpoint 1, d (i=30) at gdb.base/entry-value.c:29
     29	  i++;
     (gdb) next
     30	  e (i);
     (gdb) print i
     $1 = 31
     (gdb) print i@entry
     $2 = 30
</pre>
   <p>Strings are identified as arrays of <code>char</code> values without specified
signedness.  Arrays of either <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> get
printed as arrays of 1 byte sized integers.  <code>-fsigned-char</code> or
<code>-funsigned-char</code> <span class="sc">gcc</span> options have no effect as <span class="sc">gdb</span>
defines literal string type <code>"char"</code> as <code>char</code> without a sign. 
For program code

<pre class="smallexample">     char var0[] = "A";
     signed char var1[] = "A";
</pre>
   <p>You get during debugging
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print var0

<h3 class="section">10.4 Artificial Arrays</h3>

<p><a name="index-artificial-array-605"></a><a name="index-arrays-606"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040_0040r_007b_002c-referencing-memory-as-an-array_007d-607"></a>It is often useful to print out several successive objects of the
same type in memory; a section of an array, or an array of
dynamically determined size for which only a pointer exists in the
program.

   <p>You can do this by referring to a contiguous span of memory as an
<dfn>artificial array</dfn>, using the binary operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The left
operand of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; should be the first element of the desired array
and be an individual object.  The right operand should be the desired length
of the array.  The result is an array value whose elements are all of
the type of the left argument.  The first element is actually the left
argument; the second element comes from bytes of memory immediately
following those that hold the first element, and so on.  Here is an
example.  If a program says

<pre class="smallexample">     int *array = (int *) malloc (len * sizeof (int));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you can print the contents of <code>array</code> with

<pre class="smallexample">     p *array@len
</pre>
   <p>The left operand of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; must reside in memory.  Array values made
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; in this way behave just like other arrays in terms of
subscripting, and are coerced to pointers when used in expressions. 
Artificial arrays most often appear in expressions via the value history
(see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>), after printing one out.

   <p>Another way to create an artificial array is to use a cast. 
This re-interprets a value as if it were an array. 
The value need not be in memory:
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p/x (short[2])0x12345678
     $1 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</pre>
   <p>As a convenience, if you leave the array length out (as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>type</var><span class="samp">[])</span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;) <span class="sc">gdb</span> calculates the size to fill
the value (as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sizeof(</span><var>value</var><span class="samp">)/sizeof(</span><var>type</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;:
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p/x (short[])0x12345678
     $2 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</pre>
   <p>Sometimes the artificial array mechanism is not quite enough; in
moderately complex data structures, the elements of interest may not
actually be adjacent&mdash;for example, if you are interested in the values
of pointers in an array.  One useful work-around in this situation is
to use a convenience variable (see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>) as a counter in an expression that prints the first
interesting value, and then repeat that expression via &lt;RET&gt;.  For
instance, suppose you have an array <code>dtab</code> of pointers to
structures, and you are interested in the values of a field <code>fv</code>
in each structure.  Here is an example of what you might type:

<pre class="smallexample">     set $i = 0
     p dtab[$i++]-&gt;fv
     &lt;RET&gt;
     &lt;RET&gt;
     ...

<h3 class="section">10.5 Output Formats</h3>

<p><a name="index-formatted-output-608"></a><a name="index-output-formats-609"></a>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints a value according to its data type.  Sometimes
this is not what you want.  For example, you might want to print a number
in hex, or a pointer in decimal.  Or you might want to view data in memory
at a certain address as a character string or as an instruction.  To do
these things, specify an <dfn>output format</dfn> when you print a value.

   <p>The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value
already computed.  This is done by starting the arguments of the
<code>print</code> command with a slash and a format letter.  The format
letters supported are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>x</code><dd>Regard the bits of the value as an integer, and print the integer in
hexadecimal.

     <br><dt><code>d</code><dd>Print as integer in signed decimal.

     <br><dt><code>u</code><dd>Print as integer in unsigned decimal.

     <br><dt><code>o</code><dd>Print as integer in octal.

     <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Print as integer in binary.  The letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for &ldquo;two&rdquo;. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>

     <br><dt><code>a</code><dd><a name="index-unknown-address_002c-locating-610"></a><a name="index-locate-address-611"></a>Print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset from
the nearest preceding symbol.  You can use this format used to discover
where (in what function) an unknown address is located:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) p/a 0x54320
          $3 = 0x54320 &lt;_initialize_vx+396&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The command <code>info symbol 0x54320</code> yields similar results. 
See <a href="#Symbols">info symbol</a>.

     <br><dt><code>c</code><dd>Regard as an integer and print it as a character constant.  This
prints both the numerical value and its character representation.  The
character representation is replaced with the octal escape &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\nnn</span></samp>&rsquo;
for characters outside the 7-bit <span class="sc">ascii</span> range.

     <p>Without this format, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays <code>char</code>,
<code>unsigned&nbsp;char</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>signed&nbsp;char</code><!-- /@w --> data as character
constants.  Single-byte members of vectors are displayed as integer
data.

     <br><dt><code>f</code><dd>Regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print
using typical floating point syntax.

     <br><dt><code>s</code><dd><a name="index-printing-strings-612"></a><a name="index-printing-byte-arrays-613"></a>Regard as a string, if possible.  With this format, pointers to single-byte
data are displayed as null-terminated strings and arrays of single-byte data
are displayed as fixed-length strings.  Other values are displayed in their
natural types.

     <p>Without this format, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays pointers to and arrays of
<code>char</code>, <code>unsigned&nbsp;char</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>signed&nbsp;char</code><!-- /@w --> as
strings.  Single-byte members of a vector are displayed as an integer
array.

     <br><dt><code>z</code><dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; formatting, the value is treated as an integer and
printed as hexadecimal, but leading zeros are printed to pad the value
to the size of the integer type.

     <br><dt><code>r</code><dd><a name="index-raw-printing-614"></a>Print using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">raw</span></samp>&rsquo; formatting.  By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
use a Python-based pretty-printer, if one is available (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).  This typically results in a higher-level display of the
value's contents.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; format bypasses any Python
pretty-printer which might exist. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, to print the program counter in hex (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>), type

<pre class="smallexample">     p/x $pc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that no space is required before the slash; this is because command
names in <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot contain a slash.

   <p>To reprint the last value in the value history with a different format,
you can use the <code>print</code> command with just a format and no
expression.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p/x</span></samp>&rsquo; reprints the last value in hex.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Examining Memory</h3>

<p>You can use the command <code>x</code> (for &ldquo;examine&rdquo;) to examine memory in
any of several formats, independently of your program's data types.

   <p><a name="index-examining-memory-615"></a>
     
<a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028examine-memory_0029_007d-616"></a>
<dl><dt><code>x/</code><var>nfu</var> <var>addr</var><dt><code>x </code><var>addr</var><dt><code>x</code><dd>Use the <code>x</code> command to examine memory. 
</dl>

   <p><var>n</var>, <var>f</var>, and <var>u</var> are all optional parameters that specify how
much memory to display and how to format it; <var>addr</var> is an
expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory. 
If you use defaults for <var>nfu</var>, you need not type the slash &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Several commands set convenient defaults for <var>addr</var>.

     <dl>
<dt><var>n</var><span class="roman">, the repeat count</span><dd>The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1.  It specifies
how much memory (counting by units <var>u</var>) to display. 
<!-- This really is **decimal**; unaffected by 'set radix' as of GDB -->
<!-- 4.1.2. -->

     <br><dt><var>f</var><span class="roman">, the display format</span><dd>The display format is one of the formats used by <code>print</code>
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;), and in addition &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; (for machine instructions). 
The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; (hexadecimal) initially.  The default changes
each time you use either <code>x</code> or <code>print</code>.

     <br><dt><var>u</var><span class="roman">, the unit size</span><dd>The unit size is any of

          <dl>
<dt><code>b</code><dd>Bytes. 
<br><dt><code>h</code><dd>Halfwords (two bytes). 
<br><dt><code>w</code><dd>Words (four bytes).  This is the initial default. 
<br><dt><code>g</code><dd>Giant words (eight bytes). 
</dl>

     <p>Each time you specify a unit size with <code>x</code>, that size becomes the
default unit the next time you use <code>x</code>.  For the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; format,
the unit size is ignored and is normally not written.  For the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; format,
the unit size defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, unless it is explicitly given. 
Use <kbd>x /hs</kbd> to display 16-bit char strings and <kbd>x /ws</kbd> to display
32-bit strings.  The next use of <kbd>x /s</kbd> will again display 8-bit strings. 
Note that the results depend on the programming language of the
current compilation unit.  If the language is C, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;
modifier will use the UTF-16 encoding while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; will use
UTF-32.  The encoding is set by the programming language and cannot
be altered.

     <br><dt><var>addr</var><span class="roman">, starting display address</span><dd><var>addr</var> is the address where you want <span class="sc">gdb</span> to begin displaying
memory.  The expression need not have a pointer value (though it may);
it is always interpreted as an integer address of a byte of memory. 
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>, for more information on expressions.  The default for
<var>addr</var> is usually just after the last address examined&mdash;but several
other commands also set the default address: <code>info breakpoints</code> (to
the address of the last breakpoint listed), <code>info line</code> (to the
starting address of a line), and <code>print</code> (if you use it to display
a value from memory). 
</dl>

   <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/3uh 0x54320</span></samp>&rsquo; is a request to display three halfwords
(<code>h</code>) of memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo;),
starting at address <code>0x54320</code>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/4xw $sp</span></samp>&rsquo; prints the four
words (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo;) of memory above the stack pointer (here, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$sp</span></samp>&rsquo;;
see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>) in hexadecimal (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>Since the letters indicating unit sizes are all distinct from the
letters specifying output formats, you do not have to remember whether
unit size or format comes first; either order works.  The output
specifications &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4xw</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4wx</span></samp>&rsquo; mean exactly the same thing. 
(However, the count <var>n</var> must come first; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wx4</span></samp>&rsquo; does not work.)

   <p>Even though the unit size <var>u</var> is ignored for the formats &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;, you might still want to use a count <var>n</var>; for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3i</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies that you want to see three machine instructions,
including any operands.  For convenience, especially when used with
the <code>display</code> command, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; format also prints branch delay
slot instructions, if any, beyond the count specified, which immediately
follow the last instruction that is within the count.  The command
<code>disassemble</code> gives an alternative way of inspecting machine
instructions; see <a href="#Machine-Code">Source and Machine Code</a>.

   <p>All the defaults for the arguments to <code>x</code> are designed to make it
easy to continue scanning memory with minimal specifications each time
you use <code>x</code>.  For example, after you have inspected three machine
instructions with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/3i </span><var>addr</var></samp>&rsquo;, you can inspect the next seven
with just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/7</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you use &lt;RET&gt; to repeat the <code>x</code> command,
the repeat count <var>n</var> is used again; the other arguments default as
for successive uses of <code>x</code>.

   <p>When examining machine instructions, the instruction at current program
counter is shown with a <code>=&gt;</code> marker. For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x/5i $pc-6
        0x804837f &lt;main+11&gt;: mov    %esp,%ebp
        0x8048381 &lt;main+13&gt;: push   %ecx
        0x8048382 &lt;main+14&gt;: sub    $0x4,%esp
     =&gt; 0x8048385 &lt;main+17&gt;: movl   $0x8048460,(%esp)
        0x804838c &lt;main+24&gt;: call   0x80482d4 &lt;puts@plt&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_005f_007d_002c-_0040code_007b_0024_005f_005f_007d_002c-and-value-history-617"></a>The addresses and contents printed by the <code>x</code> command are not saved
in the value history because there is often too much of them and they
would get in the way.  Instead, <span class="sc">gdb</span> makes these values available for
subsequent use in expressions as values of the convenience variables
<code>$_</code> and <code>$__</code>.  After an <code>x</code> command, the last address
examined is available for use in expressions in the convenience variable
<code>$_</code>.  The contents of that address, as examined, are available in
the convenience variable <code>$__</code>.

   <p>If the <code>x</code> command has a repeat count, the address and contents saved
are from the last memory unit printed; this is not the same as the last
address printed if several units were printed on the last line of output.

   <p><a name="addressable-memory-unit"></a><a name="index-addressable-memory-unit-618"></a>Most targets have an addressable memory unit size of 8 bits.  This means
that to each memory address are associated 8 bits of data.  Some
targets, however, have other addressable memory unit sizes. 
Within <span class="sc">gdb</span> and this document, the term
<dfn>addressable memory unit</dfn> (or <dfn>memory unit</dfn> for short) is used
when explicitly referring to a chunk of data of that size.  The word
<dfn>byte</dfn> is used to refer to a chunk of data of 8 bits, regardless of
the addressable memory unit size of the target.  For most systems,
addressable memory unit is a synonym of byte.

(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), you may wish to verify the program's image
in the remote machine's memory against the executable file you
downloaded to the target.  Or, on any target, you may want to check
whether the program has corrupted its own read-only sections.  The
<code>compare-sections</code> command is provided for such situations.

     
<a name="index-compare_002dsections-623"></a>
<dl><dt><code>compare-sections </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>section-name</var><span class="roman">|</span><code>-r</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Compare the data of a loadable section <var>section-name</var> in the
executable file of the program being debugged with the same section in
the target machine's memory, and report any mismatches.  With no
arguments, compares all loadable sections.  With an argument of
<code>-r</code>, compares all loadable read-only sections.

     <p>Note: for remote targets, this command can be accelerated if the
target supports computing the CRC checksum of a block of memory
(see <a href="#qCRC-packet">qCRC packet</a>).

<h3 class="section">10.7 Automatic Display</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-display-624"></a><a name="index-display-of-expressions-625"></a>
If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently
(to see how it changes), you might want to add it to the <dfn>automatic
display list</dfn> so that <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints its value each time your program stops. 
Each expression added to the list is given a number to identify it;
to remove an expression from the list, you specify that number. 
The automatic display looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     2: foo = 38
     3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values.  As with
displays you request manually using <code>x</code> or <code>print</code>, you can
specify the output format you prefer; in fact, <code>display</code> decides
whether to use <code>print</code> or <code>x</code> depending your format
specification&mdash;it uses <code>x</code> if you specify either the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; format, or a unit size; otherwise it uses <code>print</code>.

     
<a name="index-display-626"></a>
<dl><dt><code>display </code><var>expr</var><dd>Add the expression <var>expr</var> to the list of expressions to display

     <br><dt><code>display/</code><var>fmt</var> <var>expr</var><dd>For <var>fmt</var> specifying only a display format and not a size or
count, add the expression <var>expr</var> to the auto-display list but

     <br><dt><code>display/</code><var>fmt</var> <var>addr</var><dd>For <var>fmt</var> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;, or including a unit-size or a
number of units, add the expression <var>addr</var> as a memory address to
be examined each time your program stops.  Examining means in effect
doing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x/</span><var>fmt</var> <var>addr</var></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">display/i $pc</span></samp>&rsquo; can be helpful, to see the machine
instruction about to be executed each time execution stops (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$pc</span></samp>&rsquo;

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-display-disabled-out-of-scope-632"></a>If a display expression refers to local variables, then it does not make
sense outside the lexical context for which it was set up.  Such an
expression is disabled when execution enters a context where one of its
variables is not defined.  For example, if you give the command
<code>display last_char</code> while inside a function with an argument
<code>last_char</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays this argument while your program
continues to stop inside that function.  When it stops elsewhere&mdash;where
there is no variable <code>last_char</code>&mdash;the display is disabled
automatically.  The next time your program stops where <code>last_char</code>
is meaningful, you can enable the display expression once again.

<h3 class="section">10.8 Print Settings</h3>

<p><a name="index-format-options-633"></a><a name="index-print-settings-634"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following ways to control how arrays, structures,
and symbols are printed.

<p class="noindent">These settings are useful for debugging programs in any language:

     
<a name="index-set-print-635"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set print address</code><dt><code>set print address on</code><dd><a name="index-print_002fdon_0027t-print-memory-addresses-636"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> prints memory addresses showing the location of stack
traces, structure values, pointer values, breakpoints, and so forth,
even when it also displays the contents of those addresses.  The default
is <code>on</code>.  For example, this is what a stack frame display looks like with
<code>set print address on</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) f
          #0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&lt;&lt;", rq=0x34c88 "&gt;&gt;")
              at input.c:530
          530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>set print address off</code><dd>Do not print addresses when displaying their contents.  For example,
this is the same stack frame displayed with <code>set print address off</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set print addr off
          (gdb) f
          #0  set_quotes (lq="&lt;&lt;", rq="&gt;&gt;") at input.c:530
          530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre>
     <p>You can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print address off</span></samp>&rsquo; to eliminate all machine
dependent displays from the <span class="sc">gdb</span> interface.  For example, with
<code>print address off</code>, you should get the same text for backtraces on
all machines&mdash;whether or not they involve pointer arguments.

     <p><a name="index-show-print-637"></a><br><dt><code>show print address</code><dd>Show whether or not addresses are to be printed. 
</dl>

   <p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints a symbolic address, it normally prints the
closest earlier symbol plus an offset.  If that symbol does not uniquely
identify the address (for example, it is a name whose scope is a single
source file), you may need to clarify.  One way to do this is with
<code>info line</code>, for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info line *0x4537</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Alternately,
you can set <span class="sc">gdb</span> to print the source file and line number when
it prints a symbolic address:

     <dl>

   <p>Another situation where it is helpful to show symbol filenames and line
numbers is when disassembling code; <span class="sc">gdb</span> shows you the line
number and source file that corresponds to each instruction.

   <p>Also, you may wish to see the symbolic form only if the address being
printed is reasonably close to the closest earlier symbol:

to always print the symbolic form of an address if any symbol precedes
it.  Zero is equivalent to <code>unlimited</code>.

     <br><dt><code>show print max-symbolic-offset</code><dd>Ask how large the maximum offset is that <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints in a
symbolic address.

   <p><a name="index-wild-pointer_002c-interpreting-641"></a><a name="index-pointer_002c-finding-referent-642"></a>If you have a pointer and you are not sure where it points, try
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print symbol-filename on</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then you can determine the name
and source file location of the variable where it points, using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p/a </span><var>pointer</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This interprets the address in symbolic form. 
For example, here <span class="sc">gdb</span> shows that a variable <code>ptt</code> points
at another variable <code>t</code>, defined in <samp><span class="file">hi2.c</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set print symbol-filename on

   <p>You can also enable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/a</span></samp>&rsquo;-like formatting all the time using

     <br><dt><code>set print array-indexes off</code><dd>Stop printing element indexes when displaying arrays.

     <br><dt><code>show print array-indexes</code><dd>Show whether the index of each element is printed when displaying

If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is printing a large array, it stops printing after it has
printed the number of elements set by the <code>set print elements</code> command. 
This limit also applies to the display of strings. 
When <span class="sc">gdb</span> starts, this limit is set to 200. 
Setting <var>number-of-elements</var> to <code>unlimited</code> or zero means
that the number of elements to print is unlimited.

     <br><dt><code>show print elements</code><dd>Display the number of elements of a large array that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will print. 
If the number is 0, then the printing is unlimited.

when the debugger prints a frame (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>).  The possible
values are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>all</code><dd>The values of all arguments are printed.

          <br><dt><code>scalars</code><dd>Print the value of an argument only if it is a scalar.  The value of more
complex arguments such as arrays, structures, unions, etc, is replaced
by <code>...</code>.  This is the default.  Here is an example where
only scalar arguments are shown:

          <pre class="smallexample">               #1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=3, s=..., ss=0xbf8d508c, u=..., e=green)
                 at frame-args.c:23
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>none</code><dd>None of the argument values are printed.  Instead, the value of each argument
is replaced by <code>...</code>.  In this case, the example above now becomes:

          <pre class="smallexample">               #1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=..., s=..., ss=..., u=..., e=...)
                 at frame-args.c:23
</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>By default, only scalar arguments are printed.  This command can be used
to configure the debugger to print the value of all arguments, regardless
of their type.  However, it is often advantageous to not print the value
of more complex parameters.  For instance, it reduces the amount of
information printed in each frame, making the backtrace more readable. 
Also, it improves performance when displaying Ada frames, because
the computation of large arguments can sometimes be CPU-intensive,
especially in large applications.  Setting <code>print frame-arguments</code>
to <code>scalars</code> (the default) or <code>none</code> avoids this computation,
thus speeding up the display of each Ada frame.

     <br><dt><code>show print frame-arguments</code><dd>Show how the value of arguments should be displayed when printing a frame.

     <br><dt><code>set print raw frame-arguments on</code><dd>Print frame arguments in raw, non pretty-printed, form.

otherwise print the value in raw form. 
This is the default.

     <p>The default value is <code>default</code> (see below for its description).  Older

<h4 class="subsection">10.9.1 Pretty-Printer Introduction</h4>

<p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints a value, it first sees if there is a pretty-printer
registered for the value.  If there is then <span class="sc">gdb</span> invokes the
pretty-printer to print the value.  Otherwise the value is printed normally.

   <p>Pretty-printers are normally named.  This makes them easy to manage. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info pretty-printer</span></samp>&rsquo; command will list all the installed
pretty-printers with their names. 
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<dfn>subprinters</dfn> are the printers for the individual data types. 
Each such subprinter has its own name. 
The format of the name is <var>printer-name</var>;<var>subprinter-name</var>.

   <p>Pretty-printers are installed by <dfn>registering</dfn> them with <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
Typically they are automatically loaded and registered when the corresponding
debug information is loaded, thus making them available without having to
do anything special.

   <p>There are three places where a pretty-printer can be registered.

     <ul>
<li>Pretty-printers registered globally are available when debugging
all inferiors.

     <li>Pretty-printers registered with a program space are available only
when debugging that program. 
See <a href="#Progspaces-In-Python">Progspaces In Python</a>, for more details on program spaces in Python.

     <li>Pretty-printers registered with an objfile are loaded and unloaded
with the corresponding objfile (e.g., shared library). 
See <a href="#Objfiles-In-Python">Objfiles In Python</a>, for more details on objfiles in Python. 
</ul>

   <p>See <a href="#Selecting-Pretty_002dPrinters">Selecting Pretty-Printers</a>, for further information on how
pretty-printers are selected,

   <p>See <a href="#Writing-a-Pretty_002dPrinter">Writing a Pretty-Printer</a>, for implementing pretty printers
for new types.

<h4 class="subsection">10.9.2 Pretty-Printer Example</h4>

<p>Here is how a C<tt>++</tt> <code>std::string</code> looks without a pretty-printer:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print s
     $1 = {
       static npos = 4294967295,
       _M_dataplus = {
         &lt;std::allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {
           &lt;__gnu_cxx::new_allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; = {
             &lt;No data fields&gt;}, &lt;No data fields&gt;
           },
         members of std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,
           std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;::_Alloc_hider:
         _M_p = 0x804a014 "abcd"
       }
     }
</pre>
   <p>With a pretty-printer for <code>std::string</code> only the contents are printed:

<h3 class="section">10.10 Value History</h3>

<p><a name="index-value-history-676"></a><a name="index-history-of-values-printed-by-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-677"></a>Values printed by the <code>print</code> command are saved in the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<dfn>value history</dfn>.  This allows you to refer to them in other expressions. 
Values are kept until the symbol table is re-read or discarded
(for example with the <code>file</code> or <code>symbol-file</code> commands). 
When the symbol table changes, the value history is discarded,
since the values may contain pointers back to the types defined in the
symbol table.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_007d-678"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_0024_007d-679"></a><a name="index-history-number-680"></a>The values printed are given <dfn>history numbers</dfn> by which you can
refer to them.  These are successive integers starting with one. 
<code>print</code> shows you the history number assigned to a value by
printing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span><var>num</var><span class="samp"> = </span></samp>&rsquo; before the value; here <var>num</var> is the
history number.

   <p>To refer to any previous value, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the value's
history number.  The way <code>print</code> labels its output is designed to
remind you of this.  Just <code>$</code> refers to the most recent value in
the history, and <code>$$</code> refers to the value before that. 
<code>$$</code><var>n</var> refers to the <var>n</var>th value from the end; <code>$$2</code>
is the value just prior to <code>$$</code>, <code>$$1</code> is equivalent to
<code>$$</code>, and <code>$$0</code> is equivalent to <code>$</code>.

   <p>For example, suppose you have just printed a pointer to a structure and
want to see the contents of the structure.  It suffices to type

<pre class="smallexample">     p *$
</pre>
   <p>If you have a chain of structures where the component <code>next</code> points
to the next one, you can print the contents of the next one with this:

<pre class="smallexample">     p *$.next
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can print successive links in the chain by repeating this
command&mdash;which you can do by just typing &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>Note that the history records values, not expressions.  If the value of
<code>x</code> is 4 and you type these commands:

<pre class="smallexample">     print x
     set x=5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then the value recorded in the value history by the <code>print</code> command
remains 4 even though the value of <code>x</code> has changed.

     
<a name="index-show-values-681"></a>
<dl><dt><code>show values</code><dd>Print the last ten values in the value history, with their item numbers. 
This is like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p $$9</span></samp>&rsquo; repeated ten times, except that <code>show
values</code> does not change the history.

     <br><dt><code>show values </code><var>n</var><dd>Print ten history values centered on history item number <var>n</var>.

     <br><dt><code>show values +</code><dd>Print ten history values just after the values last printed.  If no more
values are available, <code>show values +</code> produces no display. 
</dl>

   <p>Pressing &lt;RET&gt; to repeat <code>show values </code><var>n</var> has exactly the
same effect as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show values +</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h3 class="section">10.11 Convenience Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-convenience-variables-682"></a><a name="index-user_002ddefined-variables-683"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides <dfn>convenience variables</dfn> that you can use within
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to hold on to a value and refer to it later.  These variables
exist entirely within <span class="sc">gdb</span>; they are not part of your program, and
setting a convenience variable has no direct effect on further execution
of your program.  That is why you can use them freely.

   <p>Convenience variables are prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Any name preceded by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used for a convenience variable, unless it is one of
the predefined machine-specific register names (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>). 
(Value history references, in contrast, are <em>numbers</em> preceded
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>.)

   <p>You can save a value in a convenience variable with an assignment
expression, just as you would set a variable in your program. 
For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     set $foo = *object_ptr
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would save in <code>$foo</code> the value contained in the object pointed to by
<code>object_ptr</code>.

   <p>Using a convenience variable for the first time creates it, but its
value is <code>void</code> until you assign a new value.  You can alter the
value with another assignment at any time.

   <p>Convenience variables have no fixed types.  You can assign a convenience
variable any type of value, including structures and arrays, even if
that variable already has a value of a different type.  The convenience
variable, when used as an expression, has the type of its current value.

     
<a name="index-show-convenience-684"></a>
<a name="index-show-all-user-variables-and-functions-685"></a>
<dl><dt><code>show convenience</code><dd>Print a list of convenience variables used so far, and their values,
as well as a list of the convenience functions. 
Abbreviated <code>show conv</code>.

     <p><a name="index-init_002dif_002dundefined-686"></a><a name="index-convenience-variables_002c-initializing-687"></a><br><dt><code>init-if-undefined $</code><var>variable</var><code> = </code><var>expression</var><dd>Set a convenience variable if it has not already been set.  This is useful
for user-defined commands that keep some state.  It is similar, in concept,
to using local static variables with initializers in C (except that
convenience variables are global).  It can also be used to allow users to
override default values used in a command script.

     <p>If the variable is already defined then the expression is not evaluated so
any side-effects do not occur. 
</dl>

   <p>One of the ways to use a convenience variable is as a counter to be
incremented or a pointer to be advanced.  For example, to print
a field from successive elements of an array of structures:

<pre class="smallexample">     set $i = 0
     print bar[$i++]-&gt;contents
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Repeat that command by typing &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>Some convenience variables are created automatically by <span class="sc">gdb</span> and given
values likely to be useful.

<dl><dt><code>$_</code><dd>The variable <code>$_</code> is automatically set by the <code>x</code> command to
the last address examined (see <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>).  Other
commands which provide a default address for <code>x</code> to examine also
set <code>$_</code> to that address; these commands include <code>info line</code>
and <code>info breakpoint</code>.  The type of <code>$_</code> is <code>void *</code>
except when set by the <code>x</code> command, in which case it is a pointer
to the type of <code>$__</code>.

automatically sets this variable to the exit code of the program, and

<span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically sets this variable to that signal's number,
and resets <code>$_exitcode</code> to <code>void</code>.

     <p>To distinguish between whether the program being debugged has exited
(i.e., <code>$_exitcode</code> is not <code>void</code>) or signalled (i.e.,
<code>$_exitsignal</code> is not <code>void</code>), the convenience function
<code>$_isvoid</code> can be used (see <a href="#Convenience-Funs">Convenience Functions</a>).  For example, considering the following source code:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
          
          int
          main (int argc, char *argv[])
          {
            raise (SIGALRM);
            return 0;
          }
</pre>
     <p>A valid way of telling whether the program being debugged has exited
or signalled would be:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) define has_exited_or_signalled
          Type commands for definition of ``has_exited_or_signalled''.
          End with a line saying just ``end''.
          &gt;if $_isvoid ($_exitsignal)
           &gt;echo The program has exited\n
           &gt;else
           &gt;echo The program has signalled\n
           &gt;end
          &gt;end
          (gdb) run
          Starting program:
          
          Program terminated with signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
          The program no longer exists.
          (gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
          The program has signalled
</pre>
     <p>As can be seen, <span class="sc">gdb</span> correctly informs that the program being
debugged has signalled, since it calls <code>raise</code> and raises a
<code>SIGALRM</code> signal.  If the program being debugged had not called
<code>raise</code>, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> would report a normal exit:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
          The program has exited
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>$_exception</code><dd>The variable <code>$_exception</code> is set to the exception object being

<h3 class="section">10.12 Convenience Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-convenience-functions-695"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> also supplies some <dfn>convenience functions</dfn>.  These
have a syntax similar to convenience variables.  A convenience
function can be used in an expression just like an ordinary function;
however, a convenience function is implemented internally to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>These functions do not require <span class="sc">gdb</span> to be configured with
<code>Python</code> support, which means that they are always available.

     <dl>
<dt><code>$_isvoid (</code><var>expr</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fisvoid_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-function_007d-696"></a>Return one if the expression <var>expr</var> is <code>void</code>.  Otherwise it
returns zero.

     <p>A <code>void</code> expression is an expression where the type of the result
is <code>void</code>.  For example, you can examine a convenience variable
(see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>) to check whether
it is <code>void</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) print $_exitcode
          $1 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
          $2 = 1
          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          [Inferior 1 (process 29572) exited normally]
          (gdb) print $_exitcode
          $3 = 0
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
          $4 = 0
</pre>
     <p>In the example above, we used <code>$_isvoid</code> to check whether
<code>$_exitcode</code> is <code>void</code> before and after the execution of the
program being debugged.  Before the execution there is no exit code to
be examined, therefore <code>$_exitcode</code> is <code>void</code>.  After the
execution the program being debugged returned zero, therefore
<code>$_exitcode</code> is zero, which means that it is not <code>void</code>
anymore.

     <p>The <code>void</code> expression can also be a call of a function from the
program being debugged.  For example, given the following function:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void
          foo (void)
          {
          }
</pre>
     <p>The result of calling it inside <span class="sc">gdb</span> is <code>void</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) print foo ()
          $1 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid (foo ())
          $2 = 1
          (gdb) set $v = foo ()
          (gdb) print $v
          $3 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($v)
          $4 = 1
</pre>

<h3 class="section">10.13 Registers</h3>

<p><a name="index-registers-707"></a>You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables
with names starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The names of registers are different
for each machine; use <code>info registers</code> to see the names used on
your machine.

     
<a name="index-info-registers-708"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info registers</code><dd>Print the names and values of all registers except floating-point
and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).

     <p><a name="index-info-all_002dregisters-709"></a><a name="index-floating-point-registers-710"></a><br><dt><code>info all-registers</code><dd>Print the names and values of all registers, including floating-point
and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).

     <br><dt><code>info registers </code><var>regname</var><code> ...</code><dd>Print the <dfn>relativized</dfn> value of each specified register <var>regname</var>. 
As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative to
the selected stack frame.  The <var>regname</var> may be any register name valid on
the machine you are using, with or without the initial &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="standard-registers"></a><a name="index-stack-pointer-register-711"></a><a name="index-program-counter-register-712"></a><a name="index-process-status-register-713"></a><a name="index-frame-pointer-register-714"></a><a name="index-standard-registers-715"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> has four &ldquo;standard&rdquo; register names that are available (in
expressions) on most machines&mdash;whenever they do not conflict with an
architecture's canonical mnemonics for registers.  The register names
<code>$pc</code> and <code>$sp</code> are used for the program counter register and
the stack pointer.  <code>$fp</code> is used for a register that contains a
pointer to the current stack frame, and <code>$ps</code> is used for a
register that contains the processor status.  For example,
you could print the program counter in hex with

<pre class="smallexample">     p/x $pc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or print the instruction to be executed next with

<pre class="smallexample">     x/i $pc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or add four to the stack pointer<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a> with

<pre class="smallexample">     set $sp += 4
</pre>
   <p>Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available on
your machine even though the machine has different canonical mnemonics,
so long as there is no conflict.  The <code>info registers</code> command
shows the canonical names.  For example, on the SPARC, <code>info
registers</code> displays the processor status register as <code>$psr</code> but you
can also refer to it as <code>$ps</code>; and on x86-based machines <code>$ps</code>
is an alias for the <span class="sc">eflags</span> register.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an
integer when the register is examined in this way.  Some machines have
special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these
registers are considered to have floating point values.  There is no way
to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value
(although you can <em>print</em> it as a floating point value with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print/f $</span><var>regname</var></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>Some registers have distinct &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; data formats.  This
means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by
the operating system is not the same one that your program normally
sees.  For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point
coprocessor are always saved in &ldquo;extended&rdquo; (raw) format, but all C
programs expect to work with &ldquo;double&rdquo; (virtual) format.  In such
cases, <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally works with the virtual format only (the format
that makes sense for your program), but the <code>info registers</code> command
prints the data in both formats.

   <p><a name="index-SSE-registers-_0028x86_0029-716"></a><a name="index-MMX-registers-_0028x86_0029-717"></a>Some machines have special registers whose contents can be interpreted
in several different ways.  For example, modern x86-based machines
have SSE and MMX registers that can hold several values packed
together in several different formats.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> refers to such
registers in <code>struct</code> notation:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print $xmm1
     $1 = {
       v4_float = {0, 3.43859137e-038, 1.54142831e-044, 1.821688e-044},
       v2_double = {9.92129282474342e-303, 2.7585945287983262e-313},
       v16_int8 = "\000\000\000\000\3706;\001\v\000\000\000\r\000\000",
       v8_int16 = {0, 0, 14072, 315, 11, 0, 13, 0},
       v4_int32 = {0, 20657912, 11, 13},
       v2_int64 = {88725056443645952, 55834574859},
       uint128 = 0x0000000d0000000b013b36f800000000
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To set values of such registers, you need to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> which
view of the register you wish to change, as if you were assigning
value to a <code>struct</code> member:

<pre class="smallexample">      (gdb) set $xmm1.uint128 = 0x000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF
</pre>
   <p>Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>).  This means that you get the
value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in
were exited and their saved registers restored.  In order to see the
true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost
frame (with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">frame 0</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p><a name="index-caller_002dsaved-registers-718"></a><a name="index-call_002dclobbered-registers-719"></a><a name="index-volatile-registers-720"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cnot-saved_003e-values-721"></a>Usually ABIs reserve some registers as not needed to be saved by the
callee (a.k.a.: &ldquo;caller-saved&rdquo;, &ldquo;call-clobbered&rdquo; or &ldquo;volatile&rdquo;
registers).  It may therefore not be possible for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to know
the value a register had before the call (in other words, in the outer
frame), if the register value has since been changed by the callee. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to deduce where the inner frame saved
(&ldquo;callee-saved&rdquo;) registers, from the debug info, unwind info, or the
machine code generated by your compiler.  If some register is not
saved, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows the register is &ldquo;caller-saved&rdquo; (via
its own knowledge of the ABI, or because the debug/unwind info
explicitly says the register's value is undefined), <span class="sc">gdb</span>
displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;not&nbsp;saved&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> as the register's value.  With targets
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> has no knowledge of the register saving convention,
if a register was not saved by the callee, then its value and location
in the outer frame are assumed to be the same of the inner frame. 
This is usually harmless, because if the register is call-clobbered,
the caller either does not care what is in the register after the
call, or has code to restore the value that it does care about.  Note,
however, that if you change such a register in the outer frame, you
may also be affecting the inner frame.  Also, the more &ldquo;outer&rdquo; the
frame is you're looking at, the more likely a call-clobbered
register's value is to be wrong, in the sense that it doesn't actually
represent the value the register had just before the call.

<p><a name="index-OS-information-726"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides interfaces to useful OS facilities that can help
you debug your program.

   <p><a name="index-auxiliary-vector-727"></a><a name="index-vector_002c-auxiliary-728"></a>Some operating systems supply an <dfn>auxiliary vector</dfn> to programs at

binary values that tell system libraries important details about the
hardware, operating system, and process.  Each value's purpose is
identified by an integer tag; the meanings are well-known but system-specific. 
Depending on the configuration and operating system facilities,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may be able to show you this information.  For remote
targets, this functionality may further depend on the remote stub's
support of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:auxv:read</span></samp>&rsquo; packet, see

an unrecognized tag. 
</dl>

   <p>On some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can access operating system-specific

<h3 class="section">10.17 Memory Region Attributes</h3>

<p><a name="index-memory-region-attributes-741"></a>
<dfn>Memory region attributes</dfn> allow you to describe special handling
required by regions of your target's memory.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses
attributes to determine whether to allow certain types of memory
accesses; whether to use specific width accesses; and whether to cache
target memory.  By default the description of memory regions is

user can override the fetched regions.

   <p>Defined memory regions can be individually enabled and disabled.  When a
memory region is disabled, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the default attributes when
accessing memory in that region.  Similarly, if no memory regions have
been defined, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the default attributes when accessing
all memory.

   <p>When a memory region is defined, it is given a number to identify it;
to enable, disable, or remove a memory region, you specify that number.

<h4 class="subsection">10.17.1 Attributes</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.17.1.1 Memory Access Mode</h5>

<p>The access mode attributes set whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> may make read or
write accesses to a memory region.

   <p>While these attributes prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from performing invalid
memory accesses, they do nothing to prevent the target system, I/O DMA,
etc. from accessing memory.

     <dl>
<dt><code>ro</code><dd>Memory is read only. 
<br><dt><code>wo</code><dd>Memory is write only. 
<br><dt><code>rw</code><dd>Memory is read/write.  This is the default. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.17.1.2 Memory Access Size</h5>

<p>The access size attribute tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use specific sized
accesses in the memory region.  Often memory mapped device registers
require specific sized accesses.  If no access size attribute is
specified, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may use accesses of any size.

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.17.1.3 Data Cache</h5>

<p>The data cache attributes set whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> will cache target

<h4 class="subsection">10.17.2 Memory Access Checking</h4>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can be instructed to refuse accesses to memory that is
not explicitly described.  This can be useful if accessing such
regions has undesired effects for a specific target, or to provide
better error checking.  The following commands control this behaviour.

treat the memory not explicitly described by the memory ranges as RAM. 
The default value is <code>on</code>.

You can use the commands <code>dump</code>, <code>append</code>, and
<code>restore</code> to copy data between target memory and a file.  The
<code>dump</code> and <code>append</code> commands write data to a file, and the
<code>restore</code> command reads data from a file back into the inferior's
memory.  Files may be in binary, Motorola S-record, Intel hex,
Tektronix Hex, or Verilog Hex format; however, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can only

<h3 class="section">10.19 How to Produce a Core File from Your Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-dump-core-from-inferior-756"></a>
A <dfn>core file</dfn> or <dfn>core dump</dfn> is a file that records the memory
image of a running process and its process status (register values
etc.).  Its primary use is post-mortem debugging of a program that
crashed while it ran outside a debugger.  A program that crashes
automatically produces a core file, unless this feature is disabled by
the user.  See <a href="#Files">Files</a>, for information on invoking <span class="sc">gdb</span> in
the post-mortem debugging mode.

   <p>Occasionally, you may wish to produce a core file of the program you
are debugging in order to preserve a snapshot of its state. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> has a special command for that.

     
<a name="index-gcore-757"></a>
<a name="index-generate_002dcore_002dfile-758"></a>
<dl><dt><code>generate-core-file [</code><var>file</var><code>]</code><dt><code>gcore [</code><var>file</var><code>]</code><dd>Produce a core dump of the inferior process.  The optional argument
<var>file</var> specifies the file name where to put the core dump.  If not
specified, the file name defaults to <samp><span class="file">core.</span><var>pid</var></samp>, where
<var>pid</var> is the inferior process ID.

     <p>Note that this command is implemented only for some systems (as of
this writing, <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and S390).

     <p>On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, this command can take into account the value of the
file <samp><span class="file">/proc/</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">/coredump_filter</span></samp> when generating the core
dump (see <a href="#set-use_002dcoredump_002dfilter">set use-coredump-filter</a>).

     <p><a name="index-set-use_002dcoredump_002dfilter-759"></a><a name="set-use_002dcoredump_002dfilter"></a><br><dt><code>set use-coredump-filter on</code><dt><code>set use-coredump-filter off</code><dd>Enable or disable the use of the file
<samp><span class="file">/proc/</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">/coredump_filter</span></samp> when generating core dump
files.  This file is used by the Linux kernel to decide what types of
memory mappings will be dumped or ignored when generating a core dump
file.  <var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.

     <p>To make use of this feature, you have to write in the
<samp><span class="file">/proc/</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">/coredump_filter</span></samp> file a value, in hexadecimal,
which is a bit mask representing the memory mapping types.  If a bit
is set in the bit mask, then the memory mappings of the corresponding
types will be dumped; otherwise, they will be ignored.  This
configuration is inherited by child processes.  For more information
about the bits that can be set in the
<samp><span class="file">/proc/</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">/coredump_filter</span></samp> file, please refer to the
manpage of <code>core(5)</code>.

     <p>By default, this option is <code>on</code>.  If this option is turned
<code>off</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not read the <samp><span class="file">coredump_filter</span></samp> file
and instead uses the same default value as the Linux kernel in order
to decide which pages will be dumped in the core dump file.  This
value is currently <code>0x33</code>, which means that bits <code>0</code>
(anonymous private mappings), <code>1</code> (anonymous shared mappings),
<code>4</code> (ELF headers) and <code>5</code> (private huge pages) are active. 
This will cause these memory mappings to be dumped automatically.

<h3 class="section">10.20 Character Sets</h3>

<p><a name="index-character-sets-760"></a><a name="index-charset-761"></a><a name="index-translating-between-character-sets-762"></a><a name="index-host-character-set-763"></a><a name="index-target-character-set-764"></a>
If the program you are debugging uses a different character set to
represent characters and strings than the one <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses itself,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can automatically translate between the character sets for
you.  The character set <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses we call the <dfn>host
character set</dfn>; the one the inferior program uses we call the
<dfn>target character set</dfn>.

   <p>For example, if you are running <span class="sc">gdb</span> on a <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux system, which
uses the ISO Latin 1 character set, but you are using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
remote protocol (see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>) to debug a program
running on an IBM mainframe, which uses the <span class="sc">ebcdic</span> character set,
then the host character set is Latin-1, and the target character set is
<span class="sc">ebcdic</span>.  If you give <span class="sc">gdb</span> the command <code>set
target-charset EBCDIC-US</code>, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> translates between
<span class="sc">ebcdic</span> and Latin 1 as you print character or string values, or use
character and string literals in expressions.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> has no way to automatically recognize which character set
the inferior program uses; you must tell it, using the <code>set
target-charset</code> command, described below.

   <p>Here are the commands for controlling <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s character set
support:

     <dl>
<dt><code>set target-charset </code><var>charset</var><dd><a name="index-set-target_002dcharset-765"></a>Set the current target character set to <var>charset</var>.  To display the
list of supported target character sets, type
<kbd>set&nbsp;target-charset&nbsp;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;<!-- /@w --></kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>set host-charset </code><var>charset</var><dd><a name="index-set-host_002dcharset-766"></a>Set the current host character set to <var>charset</var>.

     <p>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses a host character set appropriate to the
system it is running on; you can override that default using the
<code>set host-charset</code> command.  On some systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot
automatically determine the appropriate host character set.  In this
case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can only use certain character sets as its host character
set.  If you type <kbd>set&nbsp;host-charset&nbsp;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;<!-- /@w --></kbd>,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will list the host character sets it supports.

     <br><dt><code>set charset </code><var>charset</var><dd><a name="index-set-charset-767"></a>Set the current host and target character sets to <var>charset</var>.  As
above, if you type <kbd>set&nbsp;charset&nbsp;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;<!-- /@w --></kbd>,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will list the names of the character sets that can be used
for both host and target.

     <br><dt><code>show charset</code><dd><a name="index-show-charset-768"></a>Show the names of the current host and target character sets.

     <br><dt><code>show host-charset</code><dd><a name="index-show-host_002dcharset-769"></a>Show the name of the current host character set.

     <br><dt><code>show target-charset</code><dd><a name="index-show-target_002dcharset-770"></a>Show the name of the current target character set.

     <br><dt><code>set target-wide-charset </code><var>charset</var><dd><a name="index-set-target_002dwide_002dcharset-771"></a>Set the current target's wide character set to <var>charset</var>.  This is
the character set used by the target's <code>wchar_t</code> type.  To
display the list of supported wide character sets, type
<kbd>set&nbsp;target-wide-charset&nbsp;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;<!-- /@w --></kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>show target-wide-charset</code><dd><a name="index-show-target_002dwide_002dcharset-772"></a>Show the name of the current target's wide character set. 
</dl>

   <p>Here is an example of <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s character set support in action. 
Assume that the following source code has been placed in the file
<samp><span class="file">charset-test.c</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     
     char ascii_hello[]
       = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119,
          111, 114, 108, 100, 33, 10, 0};
     char ibm1047_hello[]
       = {200, 133, 147, 147, 150, 107, 64, 166,
          150, 153, 147, 132, 90, 37, 0};
     
     main ()
     {
       printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     }
</pre>
   <p>In this program, <code>ascii_hello</code> and <code>ibm1047_hello</code> are arrays
containing the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Hello, world!</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a newline,
encoded in the <span class="sc">ascii</span> and <span class="sc">ibm1047</span> character sets.

   <p>We compile the program, and invoke the debugger on it:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gcc -g charset-test.c -o charset-test
     $ gdb -nw charset-test
     GNU gdb 2001-12-19-cvs
     Copyright 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     ...
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>We can use the <code>show charset</code> command to see what character sets
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is currently using to interpret and display characters and
strings:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) show charset
     The current host and target character set is `ISO-8859-1'.
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>For the sake of printing this manual, let's use <span class="sc">ascii</span> as our
initial character set:
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set charset ASCII
     (gdb) show charset
     The current host and target character set is `ASCII'.
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>Let's assume that <span class="sc">ascii</span> is indeed the correct character set for our
host system &mdash; in other words, let's assume that if <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints
characters using the <span class="sc">ascii</span> character set, our terminal will display
them properly.  Since our current target character set is also
<span class="sc">ascii</span>, the contents of <code>ascii_hello</code> print legibly:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print ascii_hello
     $1 = 0x401698 "Hello, world!\n"
     (gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
     $2 = 72 'H'
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the target character set for character and string
literals you use in expressions:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print '+'
     $3 = 43 '+'
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="sc">ascii</span> character set uses the number 43 to encode the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
character.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> relies on the user to tell it which character set the
target program uses.  If we print <code>ibm1047_hello</code> while our target
character set is still <span class="sc">ascii</span>, we get jibberish:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello
     $4 = 0x4016a8 "\310\205\223\223\226k@\246\226\231\223\204Z%"
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
     $5 = 200 '\310'
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>If we invoke the <code>set target-charset</code> followed by &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> tells us the character sets it supports:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set target-charset
     ASCII       EBCDIC-US   IBM1047     ISO-8859-1
     (gdb) set target-charset
</pre>
   <p>We can select <span class="sc">ibm1047</span> as our target character set, and examine the
program's strings again.  Now the <span class="sc">ascii</span> string is wrong, but
<span class="sc">gdb</span> translates the contents of <code>ibm1047_hello</code> from the
target character set, <span class="sc">ibm1047</span>, to the host character set,
<span class="sc">ascii</span>, and they display correctly:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set target-charset IBM1047
     (gdb) show charset
     The current host character set is `ASCII'.
     The current target character set is `IBM1047'.
     (gdb) print ascii_hello
     $6 = 0x401698 "\110\145%%?\054\040\167?\162%\144\041\012"
     (gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
     $7 = 72 '\110'
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello
     $8 = 0x4016a8 "Hello, world!\n"
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
     $9 = 200 'H'
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>As above, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the target character set for character and
string literals you use in expressions:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print '+'
     $10 = 78 '+'
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="sc">ibm1047</span> character set uses the number 78 to encode the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
character.

<h3 class="section">10.21 Caching Data of Targets</h3>

<p><a name="index-caching-data-of-targets-773"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> caches data exchanged between the debugger and a target. 
Each cache is associated with the address space of the inferior. 
See <a href="#Inferiors-and-Programs">Inferiors and Programs</a>, about inferior and address space. 
Such caching generally improves performance in remote debugging
(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), because it reduces the overhead of the
remote protocol by bundling memory reads and writes into large chunks. 
Unfortunately, simply caching everything would lead to incorrect results,
since <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not necessarily know anything about volatile
values, memory-mapped I/O addresses, etc.  Furthermore, in non-stop mode
(see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) memory can be changed <em>while</em> a gdb command
is executing. 
Therefore, by default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> only caches data
known to be on the stack<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a> or
in the code segment. 
Other regions of memory can be explicitly marked as
cacheable; see <a href="#Memory-Region-Attributes">Memory Region Attributes</a>.

</dl>

   <p><var>s</var> and <var>n</var> are optional parameters. 
They may be specified in either order, apart or together.

     <dl>
<dt><var>s</var><span class="roman">, search query size</span><dd>The size of each search query value.

          <dl>

<br><dt><code>w</code><dd>words (four bytes)
<br><dt><code>g</code><dd>giant words (eight bytes)
</dl>

     <p>All values are interpreted in the current language. 
This means, for example, that if the current source language is C/C<tt>++</tt>
then searching for the string &ldquo;hello&rdquo; includes the trailing '\0'.

     <p>If the value size is not specified, it is taken from the
value's type in the current language. 
This is useful when one wants to specify the search
pattern as a mixture of types. 
Note that this means, for example, that in the case of C-like languages
a search for an untyped 0x42 will search for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(int) 0x42</span></samp>&rsquo;
which is typically four bytes.

     <br><dt><var>n</var><span class="roman">, maximum number of finds</span><dd>The maximum number of matches to print.  The default is to print all finds. 
</dl>

   <p>You can use strings as search values.  Quote them with double-quotes
 (<code>"</code>). 
The string value is copied into the search pattern byte by byte,
regardless of the endianness of the target and the size specification.

   <p>The address of each match found is printed as well as a count of the
number of matches found.

   <p>The address of the last value found is stored in convenience variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$_</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A count of the number of matches is stored in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$numfound</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>For example, if stopped at the <code>printf</code> in this function:

<pre class="smallexample">     void

     {
       static char hello[] = "hello-hello";
       static struct { char c; short s; int i; }

       printf ("%s\n", hello);
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you get during debugging:

<h2 class="chapter">11 Debugging Optimized Code</h2>

<p><a name="index-optimized-code_002c-debugging-789"></a><a name="index-debugging-optimized-code-790"></a>
Almost all compilers support optimization.  With optimization
disabled, the compiler generates assembly code that corresponds
directly to your source code, in a simplistic way.  As the compiler
applies more powerful optimizations, the generated assembly code
diverges from your original source code.  With help from debugging
information generated by the compiler, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can map from
the running program back to constructs from your original source.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> is more accurate with optimization disabled.  If you
can recompile without optimization, it is easier to follow the
progress of your program during debugging.  But, there are many cases
where you may need to debug an optimized version.

   <p>When you debug a program compiled with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g -O</span></samp>&rsquo;, remember that the
optimizer has rearranged your code; the debugger shows you what is
really there.  Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not
exactly match your source file!  An extreme example: if you define a
variable, but never use it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> never sees that
variable&mdash;because the compiler optimizes it out of existence.

   <p>Some things do not work as well with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g -O</span></samp>&rsquo; as with just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo;, particularly on machines with instruction scheduling.  If in
doubt, recompile with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; alone, and if this fixes the problem,
please report it to us as a bug (including a test case!). 
See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>, for more information about debugging optimized code.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Inline Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-inline-functions_002c-debugging-791"></a>
<dfn>Inlining</dfn> is an optimization that inserts a copy of the function
body directly at each call site, instead of jumping to a shared
routine.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays inlined functions just like
non-inlined functions.  They appear in backtraces.  You can view their
arguments and local variables, step into them with <code>step</code>, skip
them with <code>next</code>, and escape from them with <code>finish</code>. 
You can check whether a function was inlined by using the
<code>info frame</code> command.

   <p>For <span class="sc">gdb</span> to support inlined functions, the compiler must
record information about inlining in the debug information &mdash;
<span class="sc">gcc</span> using the <span class="sc">dwarf 2</span> format does this, and several
other compilers do also.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> only supports inlined functions
when using <span class="sc">dwarf 2</span>.  Versions of <span class="sc">gcc</span> before 4.1
do not emit two required attributes (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DW_AT_call_file</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DW_AT_call_line</span></samp>&rsquo;); <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not display inlined
function calls with earlier versions of <span class="sc">gcc</span>.  It instead
displays the arguments and local variables of inlined functions as
local variables in the caller.

   <p>The body of an inlined function is directly included at its call site;
unlike a non-inlined function, there are no instructions devoted to
the call.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> still pretends that the call site and the
start of the inlined function are different instructions.  Stepping to
the call site shows the call site, and then stepping again shows
the first line of the inlined function, even though no additional
instructions are executed.

   <p>This makes source-level debugging much clearer; you can see both the
context of the call and then the effect of the call.  Only stepping by
a single instruction using <code>stepi</code> or <code>nexti</code> does not do
this; single instruction steps always show the inlined body.

   <p>There are some ways that <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not pretend that inlined
function calls are the same as normal calls:

     <ul>
<li>Setting breakpoints at the call site of an inlined function may not
work, because the call site does not contain any code.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
may incorrectly move the breakpoint to the next line of the enclosing
function, after the call.  This limitation will be removed in a future
version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>; until then, set a breakpoint on an earlier line
or inside the inlined function instead.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot locate the return value of inlined calls after
using the <code>finish</code> command.  This is a limitation of compiler-generated
debugging information; after <code>finish</code>, you can step to the next line
and print a variable where your program stored the return value.

   </ul>

<h3 class="section">11.2 Tail Call Frames</h3>

<p><a name="index-tail-call-frames_002c-debugging-792"></a>
Function <code>B</code> can call function <code>C</code> in its very last statement.  In
unoptimized compilation the call of <code>C</code> is immediately followed by return
instruction at the end of <code>B</code> code.  Optimizing compiler may replace the
call and return in function <code>B</code> into one jump to function <code>C</code>
instead.  Such use of a jump instruction is called <dfn>tail call</dfn>.

   <p>During execution of function <code>C</code>, there will be no indication in the
function call stack frames that it was tail-called from <code>B</code>.  If function
<code>A</code> regularly calls function <code>B</code> which tail-calls function <code>C</code>,
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will see <code>A</code> as the caller of <code>C</code>.  However, in
some cases <span class="sc">gdb</span> can determine that <code>C</code> was tail-called from
<code>B</code>, and it will then create fictitious call frame for that, with the
return address set up as if <code>B</code> called <code>C</code> normally.

   <p>This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging format and
the compiler has to produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DW_TAG_GNU_call_site</span></samp>&rsquo; tags.  With
<span class="sc">gcc</span>, you need to specify <samp><span class="option">-O -g</span></samp> during compilation, to get
this information.

   <p><kbd>info frame</kbd> command (see <a href="#Frame-Info">Frame Info</a>) will indicate the tail call frame
kind by text <code>tail call frame</code> such as in this sample <span class="sc">gdb</span> output:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x/i $pc - 2
        0x40066b &lt;b(int, double)+11&gt;: jmp 0x400640 &lt;c(int, double)&gt;
     (gdb) info frame

      source language c++.
      Arglist at unknown address.
      Locals at unknown address, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffda30
</pre>
   <p>The detection of all the possible code path executions can find them ambiguous. 
There is no execution history stored (possible <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a> is never
used for this purpose) and the last known caller could have reached the known
callee by multiple different jump sequences.  In such case <span class="sc">gdb</span> still
tries to show at least all the unambiguous top tail callers and all the
unambiguous bottom tail calees, if any.

     <dl>

values at function entry and tail calls.  It will show all the possible valid
tail calls code paths it has considered.  It will also print the intersection
of them with the final unambiguous (possibly partial or even empty) code path
result.

values at function entry and tail calls. 
</dl>

   <p>The analysis messages for tail calls can for example show why the virtual tail
call frame for function <code>c</code> has not been recognized (due to the indirect
reference by variable <code>x</code>):

<pre class="smallexample">     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void);
     void (*x) (void) = c;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { a (); }
     int main (void) { x (); return 0; }

     #1  0x000000000040039a in main () at t.c:5

   <p>Another possibility is an ambiguous virtual tail call frames resolution:

<pre class="smallexample">     int i;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) f (void) { i++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) e (void) { f (); }

   <p><code>initial:</code> state shows some random possible calling sequence <span class="sc">gdb</span>
has found.  It then finds another possible calling sequcen - that one is
prefixed by <code>compare:</code>.  The non-ambiguous intersection of these two is
printed as the <code>reduced:</code> calling sequence.  That one could have many
futher <code>compare:</code> and <code>reduced:</code> statements as long as there remain
any non-ambiguous sequence entries.

   <p>For the frame of function <code>b</code> in both cases there are different possible
<code>$pc</code> values (<code>0x4004cc</code> or <code>0x4004ce</code>), therefore this frame is
also ambigous.  The only non-ambiguous frame is the one for function <code>a</code>,
therefore this one is displayed to the user while the ambiguous frames are
omitted.

   <p>There can be also reasons why printing of frame argument values at function
entry may fail:

<pre class="smallexample">     int v;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (int i) { v++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i);
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (int i) { a (i); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i)
     { if (i) b (i - 1); else c (0); }
     int main (void) { a (5); return 0; }

</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot find out from the inferior state if and how many times did
function <code>a</code> call itself (via function <code>b</code>) as these calls would be
tail calls.  Such tail calls would modify thue <code>i</code> variable, therefore

<h2 class="chapter">12 C Preprocessor Macros</h2>

<p>Some languages, such as C and C<tt>++</tt>, provide a way to define and invoke
&ldquo;preprocessor macros&rdquo; which expand into strings of tokens. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can evaluate expressions containing macro invocations, show
the result of macro expansion, and show a macro's definition, including
where it was defined.

   <p>You may need to compile your program specially to provide <span class="sc">gdb</span>
with information about preprocessor macros.  Most compilers do not
include macros in their debugging information, even when you compile
with the <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> flag.  See <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>.

   <p>A program may define a macro at one point, remove that definition later,
and then provide a different definition after that.  Thus, at different
points in the program, a macro may have different definitions, or have
no definition at all.  If there is a current stack frame, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
uses the macros in scope at that frame's source code line.  Otherwise,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the macros in scope at the current listing location;
see <a href="#List">List</a>.

   <p>Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> evaluates an expression, it always expands any
macro invocations present in the expression.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> also provides
the following commands for working with macros explicitly.

     
<a name="index-macro-expand-795"></a>

expansions.  Since <span class="sc">gdb</span> simply expands macros, but does not
parse the result, <var>expression</var> need not be a valid expression; it

   <p><a name="index-macros_002c-example-of-debugging-with-812"></a>Here is a transcript showing the above commands in action.  First, we
show our source files:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ cat sample.c
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include "sample.h"
     
     #define M 42
     #define ADD(x) (M + x)
     
     main ()
     {
     #define N 28
       printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     #undef N
       printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     #define N 1729
       printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
     }
     $ cat sample.h
     #define Q &lt;
     $
</pre>
   <p>Now, we compile the program using the <span class="sc">gnu</span> C compiler,
<span class="sc">gcc</span>.  We pass the <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a> <em>and</em> <samp><span class="option">-g3</span></samp> flags to ensure the compiler
includes information about preprocessor macros in the debugging
information.

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gcc -gdwarf-2 -g3 sample.c -o sample
     $
</pre>
   <p>Now, we start <span class="sc">gdb</span> on our sample program:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb -nw sample
     GNU gdb 2002-05-06-cvs
     Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     GDB is free software, ...
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>We can expand macros and examine their definitions, even when the
program is not running.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the current listing position
to decide which macro definitions are in scope:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) list main
     3
     4       #define M 42
     5       #define ADD(x) (M + x)
     6
     7       main ()
     8       {
     9       #define N 28
     10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     11      #undef N
     12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     (gdb) info macro ADD
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:5
     #define ADD(x) (M + x)
     (gdb) info macro Q
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.h:1
       included at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:2
     #define Q &lt;
     (gdb) macro expand ADD(1)
     expands to: (42 + 1)
     (gdb) macro expand-once ADD(1)
     expands to: once (M + 1)
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>In the example above, note that <code>macro expand-once</code> expands only
the macro invocation explicit in the original text &mdash; the invocation of
<code>ADD</code> &mdash; but does not expand the invocation of the macro <code>M</code>,
which was introduced by <code>ADD</code>.

   <p>Once the program is running, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the macro definitions in
force at the source line of the current stack frame:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break main
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048370: file sample.c, line 10.
     (gdb) run
     Starting program: /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample
     
     Breakpoint 1, main () at sample.c:10
     10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>At line 10, the definition of the macro <code>N</code> at line 9 is in force:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info macro N
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:9
     #define N 28
     (gdb) macro expand N Q M
     expands to: 28 &lt; 42
     (gdb) print N Q M
     $1 = 1
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>As we step over directives that remove <code>N</code>'s definition, and then
give it a new definition, <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds the definition (or lack
thereof) in force at each point:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) next
     Hello, world!
     12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     (gdb) info macro N
     The symbol `N' has no definition as a C/C++ preprocessor macro
     at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:12
     (gdb) next
     We're so creative.
     14        printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
     (gdb) info macro N
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:13
     #define N 1729
     (gdb) macro expand N Q M
     expands to: 1729 &lt; 42
     (gdb) print N Q M
     $2 = 0
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>In addition to source files, macros can be defined on the compilation command
line using the <samp><span class="option">-D</span><var>name</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var></samp> syntax.  For macros defined in
such a way, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays the location of their definition as line zero
of the source file submitted to the compiler.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info macro __STDC__

<h2 class="chapter">13 Tracepoints</h2>

<!-- This chapter is based on the documentation written by Michael -->
<!-- Snyder, David Taylor, Jim Blandy, and Elena Zannoni. -->
<p><a name="index-tracepoints-813"></a>In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn
anything helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness
depends on its real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger
might cause the program to change its behavior drastically, or perhaps
fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able
to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   <p>Using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s <code>trace</code> and <code>collect</code> commands, you can
specify locations in the program, called <dfn>tracepoints</dfn>, and
arbitrary expressions to evaluate when those tracepoints are reached. 
Later, using the <code>tfind</code> command, you can examine the values
those expressions had when the program hit the tracepoints.  The
expressions may also denote objects in memory&mdash;structures or arrays,
for example&mdash;whose values <span class="sc">gdb</span> should record; while visiting
a particular tracepoint, you may inspect those objects as if they were
in memory at that moment.  However, because <span class="sc">gdb</span> records these
values without interacting with you, it can do so quickly and
unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program's behavior.

   <p>The tracepoint facility is currently available only for remote
targets.  See <a href="#Targets">Targets</a>.  In addition, your remote target must know
how to collect trace data.  This functionality is implemented in the
remote stub; however, none of the stubs distributed with <span class="sc">gdb</span>
support tracepoints as of this writing.  The format of the remote
packets used to implement tracepoints are described in <a href="#Tracepoint-Packets">Tracepoint Packets</a>.

   <p>It is also possible to get trace data from a file, in a manner reminiscent
of corefiles; you specify the filename, and use <code>tfind</code> to search
through the file.  See <a href="#Trace-Files">Trace Files</a>, for more details.

   <p>This chapter describes the tracepoint commands and features.

<h3 class="section">13.1 Commands to Set Tracepoints</h3>

<p>Before running such a <dfn>trace experiment</dfn>, an arbitrary number of
tracepoints can be set.  A tracepoint is actually a special type of
breakpoint (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Set Breaks</a>), so you can manipulate it using
standard breakpoint commands.  For instance, as with breakpoints,
tracepoint numbers are successive integers starting from one, and many
of the commands associated with tracepoints take the tracepoint number
as their argument, to identify which tracepoint to work on.

   <p>For each tracepoint, you can specify, in advance, some arbitrary set
of data that you want the target to collect in the trace buffer when
it hits that tracepoint.  The collected data can include registers,
local variables, or global data.  Later, you can use <span class="sc">gdb</span>
commands to examine the values these data had at the time the
tracepoint was hit.

   <p>Tracepoints do not support every breakpoint feature.  Ignore counts on
tracepoints have no effect, and tracepoints cannot run <span class="sc">gdb</span>
commands when they are hit.  Tracepoints may not be thread-specific
either.

   <p><a name="index-fast-tracepoints-814"></a>Some targets may support <dfn>fast tracepoints</dfn>, which are inserted in
a different way (such as with a jump instead of a trap), that is
faster but possibly restricted in where they may be installed.

   <p><a name="index-static-tracepoints-815"></a><a name="index-markers_002c-static-tracepoints-816"></a><a name="index-probing-markers_002c-static-tracepoints-817"></a>Regular and fast tracepoints are dynamic tracing facilities, meaning
that they can be used to insert tracepoints at (almost) any location
in the target.  Some targets may also support controlling <dfn>static
tracepoints</dfn> from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  With static tracing, a set of
instrumentation points, also known as <dfn>markers</dfn>, are embedded in
the target program, and can be activated or deactivated by name or
address.  These are usually placed at locations which facilitate
investigating what the target is actually doing.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
support for static tracing includes being able to list instrumentation
points, and attach them with <span class="sc">gdb</span> defined high level
tracepoints that expose the whole range of convenience of
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s tracepoints support.  Namely, support for collecting
registers values and values of global or local (to the instrumentation
point) variables; tracepoint conditions and trace state variables. 
The act of installing a <span class="sc">gdb</span> static tracepoint on an
instrumentation point, or marker, is referred to as <dfn>probing</dfn> a
static tracepoint marker.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> supports tracepoints on some target systems. 
See <a href="#Server">Tracepoints support in <code>gdbserver</code></a>.

   <p>This section describes commands to set tracepoints and associated
conditions and actions.

<a name="index-set-tracepoint-818"></a>
<a name="index-trace-819"></a>
<dl><dt><code>trace </code><var>location</var><dd>The <code>trace</code> command is very similar to the <code>break</code> command. 
Its argument <var>location</var> can be a source line, a function name, or
an address in the target program.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.  The
<code>trace</code> command defines a tracepoint, which is a point in the
target program where the debugger will briefly stop, collect some
data, and then allow the program to continue.  Setting a tracepoint or
changing its actions takes effect immediately if the remote stub
supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">InstallInTrace</span></samp>&rsquo; feature (see <a href="#install-tracepoint-in-tracing">install tracepoint in tracing</a>). 
If remote stub doesn't support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">InstallInTrace</span></samp>&rsquo; feature, all
these changes don't take effect until the next <code>tstart</code>
command, and once a trace experiment is running, further changes will
not have any effect until the next trace experiment starts.  In addition,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> supports <dfn>pending tracepoints</dfn>&mdash;tracepoints whose
address is not yet resolved.  (This is similar to pending breakpoints.) 
Pending tracepoints are not downloaded to the target and not installed
until they are resolved.  The resolution of pending tracepoints requires
<span class="sc">gdb</span> support&mdash;when debugging with the remote target, and
<span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnects from the remote stub (see <a href="#disconnected-tracing">disconnected tracing</a>), pending tracepoints can not be resolved (and downloaded to
the remote stub) while <span class="sc">gdb</span> is disconnected.

     <p>Here are some examples of using the <code>trace</code> command:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <b>trace foo.c:121</b>    // a source file and line number
          
          (gdb) <b>trace +2</b>           // 2 lines forward
          
          (gdb) <b>trace my_function</b>  // first source line of function
          
          (gdb) <b>trace *my_function</b> // EXACT start address of function
          
          (gdb) <b>trace *0x2117c4</b>    // an address
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can abbreviate <code>trace</code> as <code>tr</code>.

     <br><dt><code>trace </code><var>location</var><code> if </code><var>cond</var><dd>Set a tracepoint with condition <var>cond</var>; evaluate the expression
<var>cond</var> each time the tracepoint is reached, and collect data only
if the value is nonzero&mdash;that is, if <var>cond</var> evaluates as true. 
See <a href="#Tracepoint-Conditions">Tracepoint Conditions</a>, for more
information on tracepoint conditions.

     <br><dt><code>ftrace </code><var>location</var><code> [ if </code><var>cond</var><code> ]</code><dd><a name="index-set-fast-tracepoint-820"></a><a name="index-fast-tracepoints_002c-setting-821"></a><a name="index-ftrace-822"></a>The <code>ftrace</code> command sets a fast tracepoint.  For targets that
support them, fast tracepoints will use a more efficient but possibly
less general technique to trigger data collection, such as a jump
instruction instead of a trap, or some sort of hardware support.  It
may not be possible to create a fast tracepoint at the desired
location, in which case the command will exit with an explanatory
message.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> handles arguments to <code>ftrace</code> exactly as for
<code>trace</code>.

     <p>On 32-bit x86-architecture systems, fast tracepoints normally need to
be placed at an instruction that is 5 bytes or longer, but can be
placed at 4-byte instructions if the low 64K of memory of the target
program is available to install trampolines.  Some Unix-type systems,
such as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, exclude low addresses from the program's
address space; but for instance with the Linux kernel it is possible
to let <span class="sc">gdb</span> use this area by doing a <samp><span class="command">sysctl</span></samp> command
to set the <code>mmap_min_addr</code> kernel parameter, as in

     <pre class="example">          sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=32768
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which sets the low address to 32K, which leaves plenty of room for
trampolines.  The minimum address should be set to a page boundary.

     <br><dt><code>strace </code><var>location</var><code> [ if </code><var>cond</var><code> ]</code><dd><a name="index-set-static-tracepoint-823"></a><a name="index-static-tracepoints_002c-setting-824"></a><a name="index-probe-static-tracepoint-marker-825"></a><a name="index-strace-826"></a>The <code>strace</code> command sets a static tracepoint.  For targets that
support it, setting a static tracepoint probes a static
instrumentation point, or marker, found at <var>location</var>.  It may not
be possible to set a static tracepoint at the desired location, in
which case the command will exit with an explanatory message.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> handles arguments to <code>strace</code> exactly as for
<code>trace</code>, with the addition that the user can also specify
<code>-m </code><var>marker</var> as <var>location</var>.  This probes the marker
identified by the <var>marker</var> string identifier.  This identifier
depends on the static tracepoint backend library your program is
using.  You can find all the marker identifiers in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ID</span></samp>&rsquo; field
of the <code>info static-tracepoint-markers</code> command output. 
See <a href="#Listing-Static-Tracepoint-Markers">Listing Static Tracepoint Markers</a>.  For example, in the following small program using the UST
tracing engine:

     <pre class="smallexample">          main ()
          {
            trace_mark(ust, bar33, "str %s", "FOOBAZ");
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the marker id is composed of joining the first two arguments to the
<code>trace_mark</code> call with a slash, which translates to:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info static-tracepoint-markers
          Cnt Enb ID         Address            What
          1   n   ust/bar33  0x0000000000400ddc in main at stexample.c:22
                   Data: "str %s"
          [etc...]
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">so you may probe the marker above with:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) strace -m ust/bar33
</pre>
     <p>Static tracepoints accept an extra collect action &mdash; <code>collect
$_sdata</code>.  This collects arbitrary user data passed in the probe point
call to the tracing library.  In the UST example above, you'll see
that the third argument to <code>trace_mark</code> is a printf-like format
string.  The user data is then the result of running that formating
string against the following arguments.  Note that <code>info
static-tracepoint-markers</code> command output lists that format string in
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Data:</span></samp>&rsquo; field.

     <p>You can inspect this data when analyzing the trace buffer, by printing
the $_sdata variable like any other variable available to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  See <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024tpnum-827"></a><a name="index-last-tracepoint-number-828"></a><a name="index-recent-tracepoint-number-829"></a><a name="index-tracepoint-number-830"></a>The convenience variable <code>$tpnum</code> records the tracepoint number

<dl><dt><code>passcount </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>n</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>num</var><span class="roman">]]</span><dd>Set the <dfn>passcount</dfn> of a tracepoint.  The passcount is a way to
automatically stop a trace experiment.  If a tracepoint's passcount is
<var>n</var>, then the trace experiment will be automatically stopped on
the <var>n</var>'th time that tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number
<var>num</var> is not specified, the <code>passcount</code> command sets the
passcount of the most recently defined tracepoint.  If no passcount is
given, the trace experiment will run until stopped explicitly by the
user.

<h4 class="subsection">13.1.4 Tracepoint Conditions</h4>

<p><a name="index-conditional-tracepoints-837"></a><a name="index-tracepoint-conditions-838"></a>
The simplest sort of tracepoint collects data every time your program
reaches a specified place.  You can also specify a <dfn>condition</dfn> for
a tracepoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  A
tracepoint with a condition evaluates the expression each time your
program reaches it, and data collection happens only if the condition
is true.

   <p>Tracepoint conditions can be specified when a tracepoint is set, by
using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>&rsquo; in the arguments to the <code>trace</code> command. 
See <a href="#Create-and-Delete-Tracepoints">Setting Tracepoints</a>.  They can
also be set or changed at any time with the <code>condition</code> command,
just as with breakpoints.

   <p>Unlike breakpoint conditions, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not actually evaluate
the conditional expression itself.  Instead, <span class="sc">gdb</span> encodes the
expression into an agent expression (see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>)
suitable for execution on the target, independently of <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
Global variables become raw memory locations, locals become stack
accesses, and so forth.

   <p>For instance, suppose you have a function that is usually called
frequently, but should not be called after an error has occurred.  You
could use the following tracepoint command to collect data about calls
of that function that happen while the error code is propagating
through the program; an unconditional tracepoint could end up
collecting thousands of useless trace frames that you would have to
search through.

<h4 class="subsection">13.1.5 Trace State Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-trace-state-variables-839"></a>
A <dfn>trace state variable</dfn> is a special type of variable that is
created and managed by target-side code.  The syntax is the same as
that for GDB's convenience variables (a string prefixed with &ldquo;$&rdquo;),
but they are stored on the target.  They must be created explicitly,
using a <code>tvariable</code> command.  They are always 64-bit signed
integers.

   <p>Trace state variables are remembered by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and downloaded
to the target along with tracepoint information when the trace
experiment starts.  There are no intrinsic limits on the number of
trace state variables, beyond memory limitations of the target.

   <p><a name="index-convenience-variables_002c-and-trace-state-variables-840"></a>Although trace state variables are managed by the target, you can use
them in print commands and expressions as if they were convenience
variables; <span class="sc">gdb</span> will get the current value from the target
while the trace experiment is running.  Trace state variables share
the same namespace as other &ldquo;$&rdquo; variables, which means that you
cannot have trace state variables with names like <code>$23</code> or
<code>$pc</code>, nor can you have a trace state variable and a convenience
variable with the same name.

     <dl>
<dt><code>tvariable $</code><var>name</var><code> [ = </code><var>expression</var><code> ]</code><dd><a name="index-tvariable-841"></a>The <code>tvariable</code> command creates a new trace state variable named
<code>$</code><var>name</var>, and optionally gives it an initial value of
<var>expression</var>.  The <var>expression</var> is evaluated when this command is
entered; the result will be converted to an integer if possible,
otherwise <span class="sc">gdb</span> will report an error. A subsequent
<code>tvariable</code> command specifying the same name does not create a
variable, but instead assigns the supplied initial value to the
existing variable of that name, overwriting any previous initial
value. The default initial value is 0.

     <br><dt><code>info tvariables</code><dd><a name="index-info-tvariables-842"></a>List all the trace state variables along with their initial values.

<h4 class="subsection">13.1.6 Tracepoint Action Lists</h4>

     
<a name="index-actions-844"></a>
<a name="index-tracepoint-actions-845"></a>
<dl><dt><code>actions </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>num</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>This command will prompt for a list of actions to be taken when the
tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number <var>num</var> is not
specified, this command sets the actions for the one that was most
recently defined (so that you can define a tracepoint and then say
<code>actions</code> without bothering about its number).  You specify the
actions themselves on the following lines, one action at a time, and
terminate the actions list with a line containing just <code>end</code>.  So
far, the only defined actions are <code>collect</code>, <code>teval</code>, and
<code>while-stepping</code>.

     <p><code>actions</code> is actually equivalent to <code>commands</code> (see <a href="#Break-Commands">Breakpoint Command Lists</a>), except that only the defined
actions are allowed; any other <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is rejected.

     <p><a name="index-remove-actions-from-a-tracepoint-846"></a>To remove all actions from a tracepoint, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">actions </span><var>num</var></samp>&rsquo;
and follow it immediately with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">end</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <b>collect </b><var>data</var> // collect some data
          
          (gdb) <b>while-stepping 5</b> // single-step 5 times, collect data
          
          (gdb) <b>end</b>              // signals the end of actions.
</pre>
     <p>In the following example, the action list begins with <code>collect</code>
commands indicating the things to be collected when the tracepoint is
hit.  Then, in order to single-step and collect additional data
following the tracepoint, a <code>while-stepping</code> command is used,
followed by the list of things to be collected after each step in a
sequence of single steps.  The <code>while-stepping</code> command is
terminated by its own separate <code>end</code> command.  Lastly, the action
list is terminated by an <code>end</code> command.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <b>trace foo</b>
          (gdb) <b>actions</b>
          Enter actions for tracepoint 1, one per line:
          &gt; collect bar,baz
          &gt; collect $regs
          &gt; while-stepping 12
            &gt; collect $pc, arr[i]
            &gt; end
          end
</pre>

This command accepts a comma-separated list of any valid expressions. 
In addition to global, static, or local variables, the following
special arguments are supported:

          <dl>
<dt><code>$regs</code><dd>Collect all registers.

          <br><dt><code>$args</code><dd>Collect all function arguments.

          <br><dt><code>$locals</code><dd>Collect all local variables.

          <br><dt><code>$_ret</code><dd>Collect the return address.  This is helpful if you want to see more
of a backtrace.

          <br><dt><code>$_probe_argc</code><dd>Collects the number of arguments from the static probe at which the
tracepoint is located. 
See <a href="#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>.

          <br><dt><code>$_probe_arg</code><var>n</var><dd><var>n</var> is an integer between 0 and 11.  Collects the <var>n</var>th argument
from the static probe at which the tracepoint is located. 
See <a href="#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>.

          <br><dt><code>$_sdata</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fsdata_0040r_007b_002c-collect_007d-848"></a>Collect static tracepoint marker specific data.  Only available for
static tracepoints.  See <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>.  On the UST static tracepoints library backend, an
instrumentation point resembles a <code>printf</code> function call.  The
tracing library is able to collect user specified data formatted to a
character string using the format provided by the programmer that
instrumented the program.  Other backends have similar mechanisms. 
Here's an example of a UST marker call:

          <pre class="smallexample">                const char master_name[] = "$your_name";
                trace_mark(channel1, marker1, "hello %s", master_name)
</pre>
          <p>In this case, collecting <code>$_sdata</code> collects the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hello $yourname</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When analyzing the trace buffer, you can
inspect &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$_sdata</span></samp>&rsquo; like any other variable available to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
</dl>

     <p>You can give several consecutive <code>collect</code> commands, each one
with a single argument, or one <code>collect</code> command with several
arguments separated by commas; the effect is the same.

     <p>The optional <var>mods</var> changes the usual handling of the arguments. 
<code>s</code> requests that pointers to chars be handled as strings, in
particular collecting the contents of the memory being pointed at, up
to the first zero.  The upper bound is by default the value of the
<code>print elements</code> variable; if <code>s</code> is followed by a decimal
number, that is the upper bound instead.  So for instance
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">collect/s25 mystr</span></samp>&rsquo; collects as many as 25 characters at
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mystr</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>The command <code>info scope</code> (see <a href="#Symbols">info scope</a>) is
particularly useful for figuring out what data to collect.

     <p><a name="index-teval-_0040r_007b_0028tracepoints_0029_007d-849"></a><br><dt><code>teval </code><var>expr1</var><code>, </code><var>expr2</var><code>, ...</code><dd>Evaluate the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.  This
command accepts a comma-separated list of expressions.  The results
are discarded, so this is mainly useful for assigning values to trace
state variables (see <a href="#Trace-State-Variables">Trace State Variables</a>) without adding those
values to the trace buffer, as would be the case if the <code>collect</code>
action were used.

     <p><a name="index-while_002dstepping-_0040r_007b_0028tracepoints_0029_007d-850"></a><br><dt><code>while-stepping </code><var>n</var><dd>Perform <var>n</var> single-step instruction traces after the tracepoint,
collecting new data after each step.  The <code>while-stepping</code>
command is followed by the list of what to collect while stepping
(followed by its own <code>end</code> command):

     <pre class="smallexample">          &gt; while-stepping 12
            &gt; collect $regs, myglobal
            &gt; end
          &gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that <code>$pc</code> is not automatically collected by
<code>while-stepping</code>; you need to explicitly collect that register if
you need it.  You may abbreviate <code>while-stepping</code> as <code>ws</code> or
<code>stepping</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set default-collect </code><var>expr1</var><code>, </code><var>expr2</var><code>, ...</code><dd><a name="index-set-default_002dcollect-851"></a><a name="index-default-collection-action-852"></a>This variable is a list of expressions to collect at each tracepoint
hit.  It is effectively an additional <code>collect</code> action prepended
to every tracepoint action list.  The expressions are parsed
individually for each tracepoint, so for instance a variable named
<code>xyz</code> may be interpreted as a global for one tracepoint, and a
local for another, as appropriate to the tracepoint's location.

     <br><dt><code>show default-collect</code><dd><a name="index-show-default_002dcollect-853"></a>Show the list of expressions that are collected by default at each

   <p>When you reconnect to the target, the trace experiment may or may not
still be running; it might have filled the trace buffer in the
meantime, or stopped for one of the other reasons.  If it is running,
it will continue after reconnection.

   <p>Upon reconnection, the target will upload information about the
tracepoints in effect.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will then compare that
information to the set of tracepoints currently defined, and attempt
to match them up, allowing for the possibility that the numbers may
have changed due to creation and deletion in the meantime.  If one of
the target's tracepoints does not match any in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the
debugger will create a new tracepoint, so that you have a number with
which to specify that tracepoint.  This matching-up process is
necessarily heuristic, and it may result in useless tracepoints being
created; you may simply delete them if they are of no use.

   <p><a name="index-circular-trace-buffer-870"></a>If your target agent supports a <dfn>circular trace buffer</dfn>, then you
can run a trace experiment indefinitely without filling the trace
buffer; when space runs out, the agent deletes already-collected trace
frames, oldest first, until there is enough room to continue
collecting.  This is especially useful if your tracepoints are being
hit too often, and your trace gets terminated prematurely because the
buffer is full.  To ask for a circular trace buffer, simply set
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">circular-trace-buffer</span></samp>&rsquo; to on.  You can set this at any time,
including during tracing; if the agent can do it, it will change
buffer handling on the fly, otherwise it will not take effect until

<h4 class="subsection">13.1.10 Tracepoint Restrictions</h4>

<p><a name="index-tracepoint-restrictions-881"></a>There are a number of restrictions on the use of tracepoints.  As
described above, tracepoint data gathering occurs on the target
without interaction from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Thus the full capabilities of
the debugger are not available during data gathering, and then at data
examination time, you will be limited by only having what was
collected.  The following items describe some common problems, but it
is not exhaustive, and you may run into additional difficulties not
mentioned here.

     <ul>
<li>Tracepoint expressions are intended to gather objects (lvalues).  Thus
the full flexibility of GDB's expression evaluator is not available. 
You cannot call functions, cast objects to aggregate types, access
convenience variables or modify values (except by assignment to trace
state variables).  Some language features may implicitly call
functions (for instance Objective-C fields with accessors), and therefore
cannot be collected either.

     <li>Collection of local variables, either individually or in bulk with
<code>$locals</code> or <code>$args</code>, during <code>while-stepping</code> may
behave erratically.  The stepping action may enter a new scope (for
instance by stepping into a function), or the location of the variable
may change (for instance it is loaded into a register).  The
tracepoint data recorded uses the location information for the
variables that is correct for the tracepoint location.  When the
tracepoint is created, it is not possible, in general, to determine
where the steps of a <code>while-stepping</code> sequence will advance the
program&mdash;particularly if a conditional branch is stepped.

     <li>Collection of an incompletely-initialized or partially-destroyed object
may result in something that <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot display, or displays
in a misleading way.

     <li>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays a pointer to character it automatically
dereferences the pointer to also display characters of the string
being pointed to.  However, collecting the pointer during tracing does
not automatically collect the string.  You need to explicitly
dereference the pointer and provide size information if you want to
collect not only the pointer, but the memory pointed to.  For example,
<code>*ptr@50</code> can be used to collect the 50 element array pointed to
by <code>ptr</code>.

     <li>It is not possible to collect a complete stack backtrace at a
tracepoint.  Instead, you may collect the registers and a few hundred
bytes from the stack pointer with something like <code>*(unsigned char *)$esp@300</code>
(adjust to use the name of the actual stack pointer register on your
target architecture, and the amount of stack you wish to capture). 
Then the <code>backtrace</code> command will show a partial backtrace when
using a trace frame.  The number of stack frames that can be examined
depends on the sizes of the frames in the collected stack.  Note that
if you ask for a block so large that it goes past the bottom of the
stack, the target agent may report an error trying to read from an
invalid address.

     <li>If you do not collect registers at a tracepoint, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can
infer that the value of <code>$pc</code> must be the same as the address of
the tracepoint and use that when you are looking at a trace frame
for that tracepoint.  However, this cannot work if the tracepoint has
multiple locations (for instance if it was set in a function that was
inlined), or if it has a <code>while-stepping</code> loop.  In those cases
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will warn you that it can't infer <code>$pc</code>, and default
it to zero.

<h3 class="section">13.2 Using the Collected Data</h3>

<p>After the tracepoint experiment ends, you use <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands
for examining the trace data.  The basic idea is that each tracepoint
collects a trace <dfn>snapshot</dfn> every time it is hit and another
snapshot every time it single-steps.  All these snapshots are
consecutively numbered from zero and go into a buffer, and you can
examine them later.  The way you examine them is to <dfn>focus</dfn> on a
specific trace snapshot.  When the remote stub is focused on a trace
snapshot, it will respond to all <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests for memory and
registers by reading from the buffer which belongs to that snapshot,
rather than from <em>real</em> memory or registers of the program being
debugged.  This means that <strong>all</strong> <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands
(<code>print</code>, <code>info registers</code>, <code>backtrace</code>, etc.) will
behave as if we were currently debugging the program state as it was
when the tracepoint occurred.  Any requests for data that are not in
the buffer will fail.

<h4 class="subsection">13.2.1 <code>tfind </code><var>n</var></h4>

<p><a name="index-tfind-882"></a><a name="index-select-trace-snapshot-883"></a><a name="index-find-trace-snapshot-884"></a>The basic command for selecting a trace snapshot from the buffer is
<code>tfind </code><var>n</var>, which finds trace snapshot number <var>n</var>,
counting from zero.  If no argument <var>n</var> is given, the next
snapshot is selected.

   <p>Here are the various forms of using the <code>tfind</code> command.

     <dl>
<dt><code>tfind start</code><dd>Find the first snapshot in the buffer.  This is a synonym for
<code>tfind 0</code> (since 0 is the number of the first snapshot).

     <br><dt><code>tfind none</code><dd>Stop debugging trace snapshots, resume <em>live</em> debugging.

     <br><dt><code>tfind end</code><dd>Same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tfind none</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>tfind</code><dd>No argument means find the next trace snapshot.

     <br><dt><code>tfind -</code><dd>Find the previous trace snapshot before the current one.  This permits
retracing earlier steps.

     <br><dt><code>tfind tracepoint </code><var>num</var><dd>Find the next snapshot associated with tracepoint <var>num</var>.  Search
proceeds forward from the last examined trace snapshot.  If no
argument <var>num</var> is given, it means find the next snapshot collected
for the same tracepoint as the current snapshot.

     <br><dt><code>tfind pc </code><var>addr</var><dd>Find the next snapshot associated with the value <var>addr</var> of the
program counter.  Search proceeds forward from the last examined trace
snapshot.  If no argument <var>addr</var> is given, it means find the next
snapshot with the same value of PC as the current snapshot.

     <br><dt><code>tfind outside </code><var>addr1</var><code>, </code><var>addr2</var><dd>Find the next snapshot whose PC is outside the given range of
addresses (exclusive).

     <br><dt><code>tfind range </code><var>addr1</var><code>, </code><var>addr2</var><dd>Find the next snapshot whose PC is between <var>addr1</var> and
<var>addr2</var> (inclusive).

     <br><dt><code>tfind line </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>file</var><code>:</code><span class="roman">]</span><var>n</var><dd>Find the next snapshot associated with the source line <var>n</var>.  If
the optional argument <var>file</var> is given, refer to line <var>n</var> in
that source file.  Search proceeds forward from the last examined
trace snapshot.  If no argument <var>n</var> is given, it means find the
next line other than the one currently being examined; thus saying
<code>tfind line</code> repeatedly can appear to have the same effect as
stepping from line to line in a <em>live</em> debugging session. 
</dl>

   <p>The default arguments for the <code>tfind</code> commands are specifically
designed to make it easy to scan through the trace buffer.  For
instance, <code>tfind</code> with no argument selects the next trace
snapshot, and <code>tfind -</code> with no argument selects the previous
trace snapshot.  So, by giving one <code>tfind</code> command, and then
simply hitting &lt;RET&gt; repeatedly you can examine all the trace
snapshots in order.  Or, by saying <code>tfind -</code> and then hitting
&lt;RET&gt; repeatedly you can examine the snapshots in reverse order. 
The <code>tfind line</code> command with no argument selects the snapshot
for the next source line executed.  The <code>tfind pc</code> command with
no argument selects the next snapshot with the same program counter
(PC) as the current frame.  The <code>tfind tracepoint</code> command with
no argument selects the next trace snapshot collected by the same
tracepoint as the current one.

   <p>In addition to letting you scan through the trace buffer manually,
these commands make it easy to construct <span class="sc">gdb</span> scripts that
scan through the trace buffer and print out whatever collected data
you are interested in.  Thus, if we want to examine the PC, FP, and SP
registers from each trace frame in the buffer, we can say this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>tfind start</b>
     (gdb) <b>while ($trace_frame != -1)</b>
     &gt; printf "Frame %d, PC = %08X, SP = %08X, FP = %08X\n", \
               $trace_frame, $pc, $sp, $fp
     &gt; tfind
     &gt; end
     
     Frame 0, PC = 0020DC64, SP = 0030BF3C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 1, PC = 0020DC6C, SP = 0030BF38, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 2, PC = 0020DC70, SP = 0030BF34, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 3, PC = 0020DC74, SP = 0030BF30, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 4, PC = 0020DC78, SP = 0030BF2C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 5, PC = 0020DC7C, SP = 0030BF28, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 6, PC = 0020DC80, SP = 0030BF24, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 7, PC = 0020DC84, SP = 0030BF20, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 8, PC = 0020DC88, SP = 0030BF1C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 9, PC = 0020DC8E, SP = 0030BF18, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 10, PC = 00203F6C, SP = 0030BE3C, FP = 0030BF14
</pre>
   <p>Or, if we want to examine the variable <code>X</code> at each source line in
the buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>tfind start</b>
     (gdb) <b>while ($trace_frame != -1)</b>
     &gt; printf "Frame %d, X == %d\n", $trace_frame, X
     &gt; tfind line
     &gt; end
     
     Frame 0, X = 1
     Frame 7, X = 2

   <p><code>tdump</code> works by scanning the tracepoint's current collection
actions and printing the value of each expression listed.  So
<code>tdump</code> can fail, if after a run, you change the tracepoint's
actions to mention variables that were not collected during the run.

   <p>Also, for tracepoints with <code>while-stepping</code> loops, <code>tdump</code>
uses the collected value of <code>$pc</code> to distinguish between trace
frames that were collected at the tracepoint hit, and frames that were
collected while stepping.  This allows it to correctly choose whether
to display the basic list of collections, or the collections from the
body of the while-stepping loop.  However, if <code>$pc</code> was not collected,
then <code>tdump</code> will always attempt to dump using the basic collection
list, and may fail if a while-stepping frame does not include all the
same data that is collected at the tracepoint hit.

<p><a name="index-trace-files-898"></a>
In some situations, the target running a trace experiment may no
longer be available; perhaps it crashed, or the hardware was needed
for a different activity.  To handle these cases, you can arrange to
dump the trace data into a file, and later use that file as a source
of trace data, via the <code>target tfile</code> command.

     
<a name="index-tsave-899"></a>
<dl><dt><code>tsave [ -r ] </code><var>filename</var><dt><code>tsave [-ctf] </code><var>dirname</var><dd>Save the trace data to <var>filename</var>.  By default, this command
assumes that <var>filename</var> refers to the host filesystem, so if
necessary <span class="sc">gdb</span> will copy raw trace data up from the target and
then save it.  If the target supports it, you can also supply the
optional argument <code>-r</code> (&ldquo;remote&rdquo;) to direct the target to save
the data directly into <var>filename</var> in its own filesystem, which may be
more efficient if the trace buffer is very large.  (Note, however, that
<code>target tfile</code> can only read from files accessible to the host.) 
By default, this command will save trace frame in tfile format. 
You can supply the optional argument <code>-ctf</code> to save date in CTF
format.  The <dfn>Common Trace Format</dfn> (CTF) is proposed as a trace format
that can be shared by multiple debugging and tracing tools.  Please go to
&lt;<code>http://www.efficios.com/ctf</code>&gt; to get more information.

a source of trace data.  Commands that examine data work as they do with
a live target, but it is not possible to run any new trace experiments. 
<code>tstatus</code> will report the state of the trace run at the moment
the data was saved, as well as the current trace frame you are examining. 
Both <var>filename</var> and <var>dirname</var> must be on a filesystem accessible to
the host.

<h2 class="chapter">14 Debugging Programs That Use Overlays</h2>

<p><a name="index-overlays-904"></a>
If your program is too large to fit completely in your target system's
memory, you can sometimes use <dfn>overlays</dfn> to work around this
problem.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides some support for debugging programs that
use overlays.

<h3 class="section">14.1 How Overlays Work</h3>

<p><a name="index-mapped-overlays-905"></a><a name="index-unmapped-overlays-906"></a><a name="index-load-address_002c-overlay_0027s-907"></a><a name="index-mapped-address-908"></a><a name="index-overlay-area-909"></a>
Suppose you have a computer whose instruction address space is only 64
kilobytes long, but which has much more memory which can be accessed by
other means: special instructions, segment registers, or memory
management hardware, for example.  Suppose further that you want to
adapt a program which is larger than 64 kilobytes to run on this system.

   <p>One solution is to identify modules of your program which are relatively
independent, and need not call each other directly; call these modules
<dfn>overlays</dfn>.  Separate the overlays from the main program, and place
their machine code in the larger memory.  Place your main program in
instruction memory, but leave at least enough space there to hold the
largest overlay as well.

   <p>Now, to call a function located in an overlay, you must first copy that
overlay's machine code from the large memory into the space set aside
for it in the instruction memory, and then jump to its entry point
there.

<!-- NB:  In the below the mapped area's size is greater or equal to the -->
<!-- size of all overlays.  This is intentional to remind the developer -->
<!-- that overlays don't necessarily need to be the same size. -->

</pre>
   <p>The diagram (see <a href="#A-code-overlay">A code overlay</a>) shows a system with separate data
and instruction address spaces.  To map an overlay, the program copies
its code from the larger address space to the instruction address space. 
Since the overlays shown here all use the same mapped address, only one
may be mapped at a time.  For a system with a single address space for
data and instructions, the diagram would be similar, except that the
program variables and heap would share an address space with the main
program and the overlay area.

   <p>An overlay loaded into instruction memory and ready for use is called a
<dfn>mapped</dfn> overlay; its <dfn>mapped address</dfn> is its address in the
instruction memory.  An overlay not present (or only partially present)
in instruction memory is called <dfn>unmapped</dfn>; its <dfn>load address</dfn>
is its address in the larger memory.  The mapped address is also called
the <dfn>virtual memory address</dfn>, or <dfn>VMA</dfn>; the load address is also
called the <dfn>load memory address</dfn>, or <dfn>LMA</dfn>.

   <p>Unfortunately, overlays are not a completely transparent way to adapt a
program to limited instruction memory.  They introduce a new set of
global constraints you must keep in mind as you design your program:

     <ul>
<li>Before calling or returning to a function in an overlay, your program
must make sure that overlay is actually mapped.  Otherwise, the call or
return will transfer control to the right address, but in the wrong
overlay, and your program will probably crash.

     <li>If the process of mapping an overlay is expensive on your system, you
will need to choose your overlays carefully to minimize their effect on
your program's performance.

     <li>The executable file you load onto your system must contain each
overlay's instructions, appearing at the overlay's load address, not its
mapped address.  However, each overlay's instructions must be relocated
and its symbols defined as if the overlay were at its mapped address. 
You can use GNU linker scripts to specify different load and relocation
addresses for pieces of your program; see <a href="ld.html#Overlay-Description">Overlay Description</a>.

     <li>The procedure for loading executable files onto your system must be able
to load their contents into the larger address space as well as the
instruction and data spaces.

   </ul>

   <p>The overlay system described above is rather simple, and could be
improved in many ways:

     <ul>
<li>If your system has suitable bank switch registers or memory management
hardware, you could use those facilities to make an overlay's load area
contents simply appear at their mapped address in instruction space. 
This would probably be faster than copying the overlay to its mapped
area in the usual way.

     <li>If your overlays are small enough, you could set aside more than one
overlay area, and have more than one overlay mapped at a time.

     <li>You can use overlays to manage data, as well as instructions.  In
general, data overlays are even less transparent to your design than
code overlays: whereas code overlays only require care when you call or
return to functions, data overlays require care every time you access
the data.  Also, if you change the contents of a data overlay, you
must copy its contents back out to its load address before you can copy a
different data overlay into the same mapped area.

   </ul>

<h3 class="section">14.2 Overlay Commands</h3>

<p>To use <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s overlay support, each overlay in your program must
correspond to a separate section of the executable file.  The section's
virtual memory address and load memory address must be the overlay's
mapped and load addresses.  Identifying overlays with sections allows
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to determine the appropriate address of a function or
variable, depending on whether the overlay is mapped or not.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s overlay commands all start with the word <code>overlay</code>;
you can abbreviate this as <code>ov</code> or <code>ovly</code>.  The commands are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>overlay off</code><dd><a name="index-overlay-910"></a>Disable <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s overlay support.  When overlay support is
disabled, <span class="sc">gdb</span> assumes that all functions and variables are
always present at their mapped addresses.  By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
overlay support is disabled.

     <br><dt><code>overlay manual</code><dd><a name="index-manual-overlay-debugging-911"></a>Enable <dfn>manual</dfn> overlay debugging.  In this mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
relies on you to tell it which overlays are mapped, and which are not,
using the <code>overlay map-overlay</code> and <code>overlay unmap-overlay</code>
commands described below.

     <br><dt><code>overlay map-overlay </code><var>overlay</var><dt><code>overlay map </code><var>overlay</var><dd><a name="index-map-an-overlay-912"></a>Tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> that <var>overlay</var> is now mapped; <var>overlay</var> must
be the name of the object file section containing the overlay.  When an
overlay is mapped, <span class="sc">gdb</span> assumes it can find the overlay's
functions and variables at their mapped addresses.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> assumes
that any other overlays whose mapped ranges overlap that of
<var>overlay</var> are now unmapped.

     <br><dt><code>overlay unmap-overlay </code><var>overlay</var><dt><code>overlay unmap </code><var>overlay</var><dd><a name="index-unmap-an-overlay-913"></a>Tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> that <var>overlay</var> is no longer mapped; <var>overlay</var>
must be the name of the object file section containing the overlay. 
When an overlay is unmapped, <span class="sc">gdb</span> assumes it can find the
overlay's functions and variables at their load addresses.

     <br><dt><code>overlay auto</code><dd>Enable <dfn>automatic</dfn> overlay debugging.  In this mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
consults a data structure the overlay manager maintains in the inferior
to see which overlays are mapped.  For details, see <a href="#Automatic-Overlay-Debugging">Automatic Overlay Debugging</a>.

     <br><dt><code>overlay load-target</code><dt><code>overlay load</code><dd><a name="index-reloading-the-overlay-table-914"></a>Re-read the overlay table from the inferior.  Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
re-reads the table <span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically each time the inferior
stops, so this command should only be necessary if you have changed the
overlay mapping yourself using <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This command is only
useful when using automatic overlay debugging.

     <br><dt><code>overlay list-overlays</code><dt><code>overlay list</code><dd><a name="index-listing-mapped-overlays-915"></a>Display a list of the overlays currently mapped, along with their mapped
addresses, load addresses, and sizes.

   </dl>

   <p>Normally, when <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints a code address, it includes the name
of the function the address falls in:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print main
     $3 = {int ()} 0x11a0 &lt;main&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When overlay debugging is enabled, <span class="sc">gdb</span> recognizes code in
unmapped overlays, and prints the names of unmapped functions with
asterisks around them.  For example, if <code>foo</code> is a function in an
unmapped overlay, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints it this way:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) overlay list
     No sections are mapped.
     (gdb) print foo
     $5 = {int (int)} 0x100000 &lt;*foo*&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When <code>foo</code>'s overlay is mapped, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints the function's
name normally:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) overlay list
     Section .ov.foo.text, loaded at 0x100000 - 0x100034,
             mapped at 0x1016 - 0x104a
     (gdb) print foo
     $6 = {int (int)} 0x1016 &lt;foo&gt;
</pre>
   <p>When overlay debugging is enabled, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can find the correct
address for functions and variables in an overlay, whether or not the
overlay is mapped.  This allows most <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands, like
<code>break</code> and <code>disassemble</code>, to work normally, even on unmapped
code.  However, <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s breakpoint support has some limitations:

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-breakpoints-in-overlays-916"></a><a name="index-overlays_002c-setting-breakpoints-in-917"></a>You can set breakpoints in functions in unmapped overlays, as long as
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can write to the overlay at its load address. 
<li><span class="sc">gdb</span> can not set hardware or simulator-based breakpoints in
unmapped overlays.  However, if you set a breakpoint at the end of your
overlay manager (and tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> which overlays are now mapped, if
you are using manual overlay management), <span class="sc">gdb</span> will re-set its
breakpoints properly. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">14.3 Automatic Overlay Debugging</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-overlay-debugging-918"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can automatically track which overlays are mapped and which
are not, given some simple co-operation from the overlay manager in the
inferior.  If you enable automatic overlay debugging with the
<code>overlay auto</code> command (see <a href="#Overlay-Commands">Overlay Commands</a>), <span class="sc">gdb</span>
looks in the inferior's memory for certain variables describing the
current state of the overlays.

   <p>Here are the variables your overlay manager must define to support
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s automatic overlay debugging:

     <dl>
<dt><code>_ovly_table</code>:<dd>This variable must be an array of the following structures:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct
          {
            /* The overlay's mapped address.  */
            unsigned long vma;
          
            /* The size of the overlay, in bytes.  */
            unsigned long size;
          
            /* The overlay's load address.  */
            unsigned long lma;
          
            /* Non-zero if the overlay is currently mapped;
               zero otherwise.  */
            unsigned long mapped;
          }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>_novlys</code>:<dd>This variable must be a four-byte signed integer, holding the total
number of elements in <code>_ovly_table</code>.

   </dl>

   <p>To decide whether a particular overlay is mapped or not, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
looks for an entry in <code>_ovly_table</code><!-- /@w --> whose <code>vma</code> and
<code>lma</code> members equal the VMA and LMA of the overlay's section in the
executable file.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds a matching entry, it consults
the entry's <code>mapped</code> member to determine whether the overlay is
currently mapped.

   <p>In addition, your overlay manager may define a function called
<code>_ovly_debug_event</code>.  If this function is defined, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will silently set a breakpoint there.  If the overlay manager then
calls this function whenever it has changed the overlay table, this
will enable <span class="sc">gdb</span> to accurately keep track of which overlays
are in program memory, and update any breakpoints that may be set
in overlays.  This will allow breakpoints to work even if the
overlays are kept in ROM or other non-writable memory while they
are not being executed.

<h3 class="section">14.4 Overlay Sample Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-overlay-example-program-919"></a>
When linking a program which uses overlays, you must place the overlays
at their load addresses, while relocating them to run at their mapped
addresses.  To do this, you must write a linker script (see <a href="ld.html#Overlay-Description">Overlay Description</a>).  Unfortunately,
since linker scripts are specific to a particular host system, target
architecture, and target memory layout, this manual cannot provide
portable sample code demonstrating <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s overlay support.

   <p>However, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source distribution does contain an overlaid
program, with linker scripts for a few systems, as part of its test
suite.  The program consists of the following files from
<samp><span class="file">gdb/testsuite/gdb.base</span></samp>:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">overlays.c</span></samp><dd>The main program file. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">ovlymgr.c</span></samp><dd>A simple overlay manager, used by <samp><span class="file">overlays.c</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">bar.c</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">baz.c</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">grbx.c</span></samp><dd>Overlay modules, loaded and used by <samp><span class="file">overlays.c</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="file">d10v.ld</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="file">m32r.ld</span></samp><dd>Linker scripts for linking the test program on the <code>d10v-elf</code>
and <code>m32r-elf</code> targets. 
</dl>

   <p>You can build the test program using the <code>d10v-elf</code> GCC
cross-compiler like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c overlays.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c ovlymgr.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c foo.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c bar.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c baz.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c grbx.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g overlays.o ovlymgr.o foo.o bar.o \
                       baz.o grbx.o -Wl,-Td10v.ld -o overlays
</pre>
   <p>The build process is identical for any other architecture, except that
you must substitute the appropriate compiler and linker script for the
target system for <code>d10v-elf-gcc</code> and <code>d10v.ld</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">15 Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> with Different Languages</h2>

<p><a name="index-languages-920"></a>
Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer <code>p</code> is accomplished by <code>*p</code>, but in
Modula-2, it is accomplished by <code>p^</code>.  Values can also be
represented (and displayed) differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x1ae</span></samp>&rsquo;, while in Modula-2 they appear as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1AEH</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-working-language-921"></a>Language-specific information is built into <span class="sc">gdb</span> for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program's
native language, and allowing <span class="sc">gdb</span> to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program's native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the <dfn>working
language</dfn>.

<h3 class="section">15.1 Switching Between Source Languages</h3>

<p>There are two ways to control the working language&mdash;either have <span class="sc">gdb</span>
set it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the
<code>set language</code> command for either purpose.  On startup, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
defaults to setting the language automatically.  The working language is
used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values
are printed, etc.

   <p>In addition to the working language, every source file that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> knows about has its own working language.  For some object
file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular
source file is in.  However, most of the time <span class="sc">gdb</span> infers the
language from the name of the file.  The language of a source file
controls whether C<tt>++</tt> names are demangled&mdash;this way <code>backtrace</code> can
show each frame appropriately for its own language.  There is no way to
set the language of a source file from within <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but you can
set the language associated with a filename extension.  See <a href="#Show">Displaying the Language</a>.

   <p>This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such
as <code>cfront</code> or <code>f2c</code>, that generates C but is written in
another language.  In that case, make the
program use <code>#line</code> directives in its C output; that way
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will know the correct language of the source code of the original
program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.2 Setting the Working Language</h4>

<p>If you allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to set the language automatically,
expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and
your program.

   <p><a name="index-set-language-922"></a>If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue the
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language </span><var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>lang</var> is the name of
a language, such as
<code>c</code> or <code>modula-2</code>. 
For a list of the supported languages, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Setting the language manually prevents <span class="sc">gdb</span> from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try
to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the
source language, when an expression is acceptable to both
languages&mdash;but means different things.  For instance, if the current
source file were written in C, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> was parsing Modula-2, a
command such as:

<pre class="smallexample">     print a = b + c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and place the result in <code>a</code>.  The result
printed would be the value of <code>a</code>.  In Modula-2, this means to compare
<code>a</code> to the result of <code>b+c</code>, yielding a <code>BOOLEAN</code> value.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.3 Having <span class="sc">gdb</span> Infer the Source Language</h4>

<p>To have <span class="sc">gdb</span> set the working language automatically, use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language local</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language auto</span></samp>&rsquo;.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), <span class="sc">gdb</span> sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> issues a warning.

   <p>This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language auto</span></samp>&rsquo; in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.

<h3 class="section">15.3 Type and Range Checking</h3>

<p>Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.

   <p>By default <span class="sc">gdb</span> checks for these errors according to the
rules of the current source language.  Although <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not check
the statements in your program, it can check expressions entered directly
into <span class="sc">gdb</span> for evaluation via the <code>print</code> command, for example.

<h4 class="subsection">15.3.1 An Overview of Type Checking</h4>

<p>Some languages, such as C and C<tt>++</tt>, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch
errors from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     int klass::my_method(char *b) { return  b ? 1 : 2; }
     
     (gdb) print obj.my_method (0)
     $1 = 2
<br>but<br>
     (gdb) print obj.my_method (0x1234)
     Cannot resolve method klass::my_method to any overloaded instance
</pre>
   <p>The second example fails because in C<tt>++</tt> the integer constant
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x1234</span></samp>&rsquo; is not type-compatible with the pointer parameter type.

   <p>For the expressions you use in <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands, you can tell
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to not enforce strict type checking or
to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression;
When type checking is disabled, <span class="sc">gdb</span> successfully evaluates
expressions like the second example above.

   <p>Even if type checking is off, there may be other reasons
related to type that prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from evaluating an expression. 
For instance, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not know how to add an <code>int</code> and
a <code>struct foo</code>.  These particular type errors have nothing to do
with the language in use and usually arise from expressions which make
little sense to evaluate anyway.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides some additional commands for controlling type checking:

   <p><a name="index-set-check-type-930"></a><a name="index-show-check-type-931"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set check type on</code><dt><code>set check type off</code><dd>Set strict type checking on or off.  If any type mismatches occur in
evaluating an expression while type checking is on, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints a
message and aborts evaluation of the expression.

     <br><dt><code>show check type</code><dd>Show the current setting of type checking and whether <span class="sc">gdb</span>
is enforcing strict type checking rules.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">15.3.2 An Overview of Range Checking</h4>

<p>In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.

   <p>For expressions you use in <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands, you can tell
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them,
always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue
warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.

   <p>A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member
of any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an
error.  In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the
result to &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; to lower values&mdash;for example, if <var>m</var> is
the largest integer value, and <var>s</var> is the smallest, then

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>m</var> + 1 &rArr; <var>s</var>
</pre>
   <p>This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases
specific to individual compilers or machines.  See <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>, for further details on specific languages.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides some additional commands for controlling the range checker:

   <p><a name="index-set-check-range-934"></a><a name="index-show-check-range-935"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set check range auto</code><dd>Set range checking on or off based on the current working language. 
See <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>, for the default settings for
each language.

     <br><dt><code>set check range on</code><dt><code>set check range off</code><dd>Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  A warning is issued if the setting does not
match the language default.  If a range error occurs and range checking is on,
then a message is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.

     <br><dt><code>set check range warn</code><dd>Output messages when the <span class="sc">gdb</span> range checker detects a range error,
but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing
memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix
systems).

     <br><dt><code>show range</code><dd>Show the current setting of the range checker, and whether or not it is
being set automatically by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<p><a name="index-C-and-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-operators-941"></a>
Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
<code>+</code> is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are
often defined on groups of types.

   <p>For the purposes of C and C<tt>++</tt>, the following definitions hold:

     <ul>
<li><em>Integral types</em> include <code>int</code> with any of its storage-class
specifiers; <code>char</code>; <code>enum</code>; and, for C<tt>++</tt>, <code>bool</code>.

     <li><em>Floating-point types</em> include <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and
<code>long double</code> (if supported by the target platform).

     <li><em>Pointer types</em> include all types defined as <code>(</code><var>type</var><code> *)</code>.

     <li><em>Scalar types</em> include all of the above.

   </ul>

<p class="noindent">The following operators are supported.  They are listed here
in order of increasing precedence:

     <dl>
<dt><code>,</code><dd>The comma or sequencing operator.  Expressions in a comma-separated list
are evaluated from left to right, with the result of the entire
expression being the last expression evaluated.

     <br><dt><code>=</code><dd>Assignment.  The value of an assignment expression is the value
assigned.  Defined on scalar types.

     <br><dt><var>op</var><code>=</code><dd>Used in an expression of the form <var>a</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>op</var><code>=&nbsp;</code><var>b</var><!-- /@w -->,
and translated to <var>a</var><code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</code><var>a&nbsp;op&nbsp;b</var><!-- /@w -->. 
<var>op</var><code>=</code><!-- /@w --> and <code>=</code> have the same precedence.  The operator
<var>op</var> is any one of the operators <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&amp;</code>,
<code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>.

     <br><dt><code>?:</code><dd>The ternary operator.  <var>a</var><code> ? </code><var>b</var><code> : </code><var>c</var> can be thought
of as:  if <var>a</var> then <var>b</var> else <var>c</var>.  The argument <var>a</var>
should be of an integral type.

     <br><dt><code>||</code><dd>Logical <span class="sc">or</span>.  Defined on integral types.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.1.2 C and C<tt>++</tt> Constants</h5>

<p><a name="index-C-and-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-constants-942"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> allows you to express the constants of C and C<tt>++</tt> in the
following ways:

     <ul>
<li>Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
specified by a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants
by a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0X</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Constants may also end with a letter
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>&rsquo;, specifying that the constant should be treated as a
<code>long</code> value.

     <li>Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal
point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an
exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e[[+]|-]</span><var>nnn</var><span class="samp"><!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>nnn</var> is another
sequence of digits.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is optional for positive exponents. 
A floating-point constant may also end with a letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;, specifying that the constant should be treated as being of
the <code>float</code> (as opposed to the default <code>double</code>) type; or with
a letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;, which specifies a <code>long double</code>
constant.

     <li>Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
integral equivalents.

     <li>Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes
(<code>'</code>), or a number&mdash;the ordinal value of the corresponding character
(usually its <span class="sc">ascii</span> value).  Within quotes, the single character may
be represented by a letter or by <dfn>escape sequences</dfn>, which are of
the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>nnn</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>nnn</var> is the octal representation
of the character's ordinal value; or of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>x</var></samp>&rsquo;, where
&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var></samp>&rsquo; is a predefined special character&mdash;for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo; for newline.

     <p>Wide character constants can be written by prefixing a character
constant with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;, as in C.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L'x'</span></samp>&rsquo; is the wide
form of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The target wide character set is used when
computing the value of this constant (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>).

     <li>String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded by
double quotes (<code>"</code>).  Any valid character constant (as described
above) may appear.  Double quotes within the string must be preceded by
a backslash, so for instance &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"a\"b'c"</span></samp>&rsquo; is a string of five
characters.

     <p>Wide string constants can be written by prefixing a string constant
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;, as in C.  The target wide character set is used when
computing the value of this constant (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>).

     <li>Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write pointers
to constants using the C operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;; for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{1,2,3}</span></samp>&rsquo; is a three-element array of
integers, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}</span></samp>&rsquo; is a three-by-two array,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{&amp;"hi", &amp;"there", &amp;"fred"}</span></samp>&rsquo; is a three-element array of pointers. 
</ul>

<em>Warning:</em> <span class="sc">gdb</span> can only debug C<tt>++</tt> code if you use

<span class="sc">gdb</span> works best when debugging C<tt>++</tt> code that is compiled
with the most recent version of <span class="sc">gcc</span> possible.  The DWARF

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <p><a name="index-member-functions-948"></a><li>Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like

     <p><a name="index-this_0040r_007b_002c-inside-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-member-functions_007d-949"></a><a name="index-namespace-in-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-950"></a><li>While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your

that is, <span class="sc">gdb</span> allows implicit references to the class instance
pointer <code>this</code> following the same rules as C<tt>++</tt>.  <code>using</code>

call to the right definition, with some restrictions.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not
perform overload resolution involving user-defined type conversions,
calls to constructors, or instantiations of templates that do not exist
in the program.  It also cannot handle ellipsis argument lists or
default arguments.

     <p>It does perform integral conversions and promotions, floating-point
promotions, arithmetic conversions, pointer conversions, conversions of
class objects to base classes, and standard conversions such as those of
functions or arrays to pointers; it requires an exact match on the
number of function arguments.

     <p>Overload resolution is always performed, unless you have specified
<code>set overload-resolution off</code>.  See <a href="#Debugging-C-Plus-Plus"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Features for C<tt>++</tt></a>.

     <p>You must specify <code>set overload-resolution off</code> in order to use an
explicit function signature to call an overloaded function, as in
     <pre class="smallexample">          p 'foo(char,int)'('x', 13)
</pre>
     <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> command-completion facility can simplify this;
see <a href="#Completion">Command Completion</a>.

     <p><a name="index-reference-declarations-954"></a><li><span class="sc">gdb</span> understands variables declared as C<tt>++</tt> references; you can use
them in expressions just as you do in C<tt>++</tt> source&mdash;they are automatically
dereferenced.

     <p>In the parameter list shown when <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays a frame, the values of
reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this
avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures. 
The <em>address</em> of a reference variable is always shown, unless
you have specified &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print address off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports the C<tt>++</tt> name resolution operator <code>::</code>&mdash;your
expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.  Since
one scope may be defined in another, you can use <code>::</code> repeatedly if
necessary, for example in an expression like
&lsquo;<samp><var>scope1</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>scope2</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo;.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> also allows
resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C<tt>++</tt>
debugging (see <a href="#Variables">Program Variables</a>).

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> performs argument-dependent lookup, following the C<tt>++</tt>

If you allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to set range checking automatically, it

selects the working language.

   <p>If you allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to set the language automatically, it
recognizes source files whose names end with <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.C</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="file">.cc</span></samp>, etc, and when <span class="sc">gdb</span> enters code compiled from one of

By default, when <span class="sc">gdb</span> parses C or C<tt>++</tt> expressions, strict type
checking is used.  However, if you turn type checking off, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will allow certain non-standard conversions, such as promoting integer
constants to pointers.

   <p>Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations.  Array
indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a pointer
that is not itself an array.

<span class="sc">gdb</span> can examine, set and perform computations with numbers in
decimal floating point format, which in the C language correspond to the
<code>_Decimal32</code>, <code>_Decimal64</code> and <code>_Decimal128</code> types as
specified by the extension to support decimal floating-point arithmetic.

   <p>There are two encodings in use, depending on the architecture: BID (Binary
Integer Decimal) for x86 and x86-64, and DPD (Densely Packed Decimal) for
PowerPC and S/390.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use the appropriate encoding for the
configured target.

   <p>Because of a limitation in <samp><span class="file">libdecnumber</span></samp>, the library used by <span class="sc">gdb</span>
to manipulate decimal floating point numbers, it is not possible to convert
(using a cast, for example) integers wider than 32-bit to decimal float.

   <p>In addition, in order to imitate <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s behaviour with binary floating
point computations, error checking in decimal float operations ignores
underflow, overflow and divide by zero exceptions.

   <p>In the PowerPC architecture, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a set of pseudo-registers
to inspect <code>_Decimal128</code> values stored in floating point registers.

few more commands specific to Objective-C support.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.4.1 Method Names in Commands</h5>

<p>The following commands have been extended to accept Objective-C method
names as line specifications:

   <p><a name="index-clear_0040r_007b_002c-and-Objective_002dC_007d-975"></a><a name="index-break_0040r_007b_002c-and-Objective_002dC_007d-976"></a><a name="index-info-line_0040r_007b_002c-and-Objective_002dC_007d-977"></a><a name="index-jump_0040r_007b_002c-and-Objective_002dC_007d-978"></a><a name="index-list_0040r_007b_002c-and-Objective_002dC_007d-979"></a>
     <ul>
<li><code>clear</code>
<li><code>break</code>
<li><code>info line</code>
<li><code>jump</code>
<li><code>list</code>
</ul>

   <p>A fully qualified Objective-C method name is specified as

<pre class="smallexample">     -[<var>Class</var> <var>methodName</var>]
</pre>
   <p>where the minus sign is used to indicate an instance method and a
plus sign (not shown) is used to indicate a class method.  The class
name <var>Class</var> and method name <var>methodName</var> are enclosed in
brackets, similar to the way messages are specified in Objective-C
source code.  For example, to set a breakpoint at the <code>create</code>
instance method of class <code>Fruit</code> in the program currently being
debugged, enter:

<pre class="smallexample">     break -[Fruit create]
</pre>
   <p>To list ten program lines around the <code>initialize</code> class method,
enter:

<pre class="smallexample">     list +[NSText initialize]
</pre>
   <p>In the current version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the plus or minus sign is
required.  In future versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the plus or minus
sign will be optional, but you can use it to narrow the search.  It
is also possible to specify just a method name:

<pre class="smallexample">     break create
</pre>
   <p>You must specify the complete method name, including any colons.  If
your program's source files contain more than one <code>create</code> method,
you'll be presented with a numbered list of classes that implement that
method.  Indicate your choice by number, or type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; to exit if
none apply.

   <p>As another example, to clear a breakpoint established at the
<code>makeKeyAndOrderFront:</code> method of the <code>NSWindow</code> class, enter:

<pre class="smallexample">     clear -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFront:]
</pre>

The print command has also been extended to accept methods.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     print -[<var>object</var> hash]
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-print-an-Objective_002dC-object-description-983"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005fNSPrintForDebugger_007d_002c-and-printing-Objective_002dC-objects-984"></a>will tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to send the <code>hash</code> message to <var>object</var>
and print the result.  Also, an additional command has been added,
<code>print-object</code> or <code>po</code> for short, which is meant to print
the description of an object.  However, this command may only work
with certain Objective-C libraries that have a particular hook
function, <code>_NSPrintForDebugger</code>, defined.

<code>+</code> is defined on numbers, but not on characters or other non-
arithmetic types.  Operators are often defined on groups of types.

     <dl>
<dt><code>**</code><dd>The exponentiation operator.  It raises the first operand to the power
of the second one.

     <br><dt><code>:</code><dd>The range operator.  Normally used in the form of array(low:high) to
represent a section of array.

     <br><dt><code>%</code><dd>The access component operator.  Normally used to access elements in derived
types.  Also suitable for unions.  As unions aren't part of regular Fortran,
this can only happen when accessing a register that uses a gdbarch-defined
union type.

Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
<code>+</code> is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are
often defined on groups of types.  For the purposes of Modula-2, the
following definitions hold:

     <ul>
<li><em>Integral types</em> consist of <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>CARDINAL</code>, and
their subranges.

     <li><em>Character types</em> consist of <code>CHAR</code> and its subranges.

     <li><em>Floating-point types</em> consist of <code>REAL</code>.

     <li><em>Pointer types</em> consist of anything declared as <code>POINTER TO
</code><var>type</var>.

     <li><em>Scalar types</em> consist of all of the above.

     <li><em>Set types</em> consist of <code>SET</code> and <code>BITSET</code> types.

     <li><em>Boolean types</em> consist of <code>BOOLEAN</code>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The following operators are supported, and appear in order of
increasing precedence:

     <dl>
<dt><code>,</code><dd>Function argument or array index separator.

<p><a name="index-Modula_002d2-built_002dins-1000"></a>
Modula-2 also makes available several built-in procedures and functions. 
In describing these, the following metavariables are used:

     <dl>
<dt><var>a</var><dd>represents an <code>ARRAY</code> variable.

     <br><dt><var>c</var><dd>represents a <code>CHAR</code> constant or variable.

     <br><dt><var>i</var><dd>represents a variable or constant of integral type.

     <br><dt><var>m</var><dd>represents an identifier that belongs to a set.  Generally used in the
same function with the metavariable <var>s</var>.  The type of <var>s</var> should
be <code>SET OF </code><var>mtype</var> (where <var>mtype</var> is the type of <var>m</var>).

     <br><dt><var>n</var><dd>represents a variable or constant of integral or floating-point type.

     <br><dt><var>r</var><dd>represents a variable or constant of floating-point type.

     <br><dt><var>t</var><dd>represents a type.

     <br><dt><var>v</var><dd>represents a variable.

     <br><dt><var>x</var><dd>represents a variable or constant of one of many types.  See the
explanation of the function for details.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.8.3 Constants</h5>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows you to express the constants of Modula-2 in the following
ways:

     <ul>
<li>Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with the
rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by a
trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">H</span></samp>&rsquo;, and octal integers by a trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a
decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional exponent can
then be specified, in the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E[+|-]</span><var>nnn</var></samp>&rsquo;, where
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+|-]</span><var>nnn</var></samp>&rsquo; is the desired exponent.  All of the
digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10)
digits.

     <li>Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of
like quotes, either single (<code>'</code>) or double (<code>"</code>).  They may
also be expressed by their ordinal value (their <span class="sc">ascii</span> value, usually)
followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
pair of like quotes, either single (<code>'</code>) or double (<code>"</code>). 
Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  See <a href="#C-Constants">C and C<tt>++</tt> Constants</a>, for a brief explanation of escape
sequences.

     <li>Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

     <li>Boolean constants consist of the identifiers <code>TRUE</code> and
<code>FALSE</code>.

     <li>Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

     <li>Set constants are not yet supported.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.8.4 Modula-2 Types</h5>

<p><a name="index-Modula_002d2-types-1002"></a>
Currently <span class="sc">gdb</span> can print the following data types in Modula-2
syntax: array types, record types, set types, pointer types, procedure
types, enumerated types, subrange types and base types.  You can also
print the contents of variables declared using these type. 
This section gives a number of simple source code examples together with
sample <span class="sc">gdb</span> sessions.

   <p>The first example contains the following section of code:

<pre class="smallexample">     VAR
        s: SET OF CHAR ;
        r: [20..40] ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you can request <span class="sc">gdb</span> to interrogate the type and value of
<code>r</code> and <code>s</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print s
     {'A'..'C', 'Z'}
     (gdb) ptype s
     SET OF CHAR
     (gdb) print r
     21
     (gdb) ptype r
     [20..40]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Likewise if your source code declares <code>s</code> as:

<pre class="smallexample">     VAR
        s: SET ['A'..'Z'] ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then you may query the type of <code>s</code> by:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) ptype s
     type = SET ['A'..'Z']
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that at present you cannot interactively manipulate set
expressions using the debugger.

   <p>The following example shows how you might declare an array in Modula-2
and how you can interact with <span class="sc">gdb</span> to print its type and contents:

<pre class="smallexample">     VAR
        s: ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR ;
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) ptype s
     ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR
</pre>
   <p>Note that the array handling is not yet complete and although the type
is printed correctly, expression handling still assumes that all
arrays have a lower bound of zero and not <code>-10</code> as in the example
above.

   <p>Here are some more type related Modula-2 examples:

<pre class="smallexample">     TYPE
        colour = (blue, red, yellow, green) ;
        t = [blue..yellow] ;
     VAR
        s: t ;
     BEGIN
        s := blue ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <span class="sc">gdb</span> interaction shows how you can query the data type
and value of a variable.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print s
     $1 = blue
     (gdb) ptype t
     type = [blue..yellow]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example a Modula-2 array is declared and its contents
displayed.  Observe that the contents are written in the same way as
their <code>C</code> counterparts.

<pre class="smallexample">     VAR
        s: ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
     BEGIN
        s[1] := 1 ;
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print s
     $1 = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
     (gdb) ptype s
     type = ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL
</pre>
   <p>The Modula-2 language interface to <span class="sc">gdb</span> also understands
pointer types as shown in this example:

<pre class="smallexample">     VAR
        s: POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
     BEGIN
        NEW(s) ;
        s^[1] := 1 ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you can request that <span class="sc">gdb</span> describes the type of <code>s</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) ptype s
     type = POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> handles compound types as we can see in this example. 
Here we combine array types, record types, pointer types and subrange
types:

<pre class="smallexample">     TYPE
        foo = RECORD
                 f1: CARDINAL ;
                 f2: CHAR ;
                 f3: myarray ;
              END ;
     
        myarray = ARRAY myrange OF CARDINAL ;
        myrange = [-2..2] ;
     VAR
        s: POINTER TO ARRAY myrange OF foo ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you can ask <span class="sc">gdb</span> to describe the type of <code>s</code> as shown
below.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) ptype s
     type = POINTER TO ARRAY [-2..2] OF foo = RECORD
         f1 : CARDINAL;
         f2 : CHAR;
         f3 : ARRAY [-2..2] OF CARDINAL;
     END
</pre>

If type and range checking are set automatically by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, they
both default to <code>on</code> whenever the working language changes to
Modula-2.  This happens regardless of whether you or <span class="sc">gdb</span>
selected the working language.

   <p>If you allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to set the language automatically, then entering
code compiled from a file whose name ends with <samp><span class="file">.mod</span></samp> sets the
working language to Modula-2.  See <a href="#Automatically">Having <span class="sc">gdb</span> Infer the Source Language</a>, for further details.

<p><a name="index-Modula_002d2_002c-deviations-from-1004"></a>
A few changes have been made to make Modula-2 programs easier to debug. 
This is done primarily via loosening its type strictness:

     <ul>
<li>Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in a
pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that
returned a pointer.)

     <li>C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent
non-printable characters.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints out strings with these
escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters are
printed using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CHR(</span><var>nnn</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; format.

     <li>The assignment operator (<code>:=</code>) returns the value of its right-hand
argument.

     <li>All built-in procedures both modify <em>and</em> return their argument. 
</ul>

   <!-- FIXME remove warning when type/range checks added -->

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> considers two Modula-2 variables type equivalent if:

     <ul>
<li>They are of types that have been declared equivalent via a <code>TYPE

     <li>They have been declared on the same line.  (Note:  This is true of the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Modula-2 compiler, but it may not be true of other compilers.) 
</ul>

   <p>As long as type checking is enabled, any attempt to combine variables
whose types are not equivalent is an error.

   <p>Range checking is done on all mathematical operations, assignment, array
index bounds, and all built-in functions and procedures.

There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator
(<code>.</code>) and the <span class="sc">gdb</span> scope operator (<code>::</code>).  The two have
similar syntax:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     <var>module</var> . <var>id</var>
     <var>scope</var> :: <var>id</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>scope</var> is the name of a module or a procedure,
<var>module</var> the name of a module, and <var>id</var> is any declared
identifier within your program, except another module.

   <p>Using the <code>::</code> operator makes <span class="sc">gdb</span> search the scope
specified by <var>scope</var> for the identifier <var>id</var>.  If it is not
found in the specified scope, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches all scopes
enclosing the one specified by <var>scope</var>.

   <p>Using the <code>.</code> operator makes <span class="sc">gdb</span> search the current scope for
the identifier specified by <var>id</var> that was imported from the
definition module specified by <var>module</var>.  With this operator, it is
an error if the identifier <var>id</var> was not imported from definition
module <var>module</var>, or if <var>id</var> is not an identifier in
<var>module</var>.

<p>Some <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands have little use when debugging Modula-2 programs. 
Five subcommands of <code>set print</code> and <code>show print</code> apply
specifically to C and C<tt>++</tt>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vtbl</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">demangle</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">asm-demangle</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">object</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">union</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The first four
apply to C<tt>++</tt>, and the last to the C <code>union</code> type, which has no direct
analogue in Modula-2.

   <p>The <code>@</code> operator (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>), while available
with any language, is not useful with Modula-2.  Its
intent is to aid the debugging of <dfn>dynamic arrays</dfn>, which cannot be
created in Modula-2 as they can in C or C<tt>++</tt>.  However, because an
address can be specified by an integral constant, the construct
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span><var>type</var><span class="samp">}</span><var>adrexp</var></samp>&rsquo; is still useful.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.1 Introduction</h5>

<p><a name="index-Ada-mode_002c-general-1013"></a>
The Ada mode of <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports a fairly large subset of Ada expression
syntax, with some extensions. 
The philosophy behind the design of this subset is

     <ul>
<li>That <span class="sc">gdb</span> should provide basic literals and access to operations for
arithmetic, dereferencing, field selection, indexing, and subprogram calls,
leaving more sophisticated computations to subprograms written into the
program (which therefore may be called from <span class="sc">gdb</span>).

     <li>That type safety and strict adherence to Ada language restrictions
are not particularly important to the <span class="sc">gdb</span> user.

     <li>That brevity is important to the <span class="sc">gdb</span> user. 
</ul>

   <p>Thus, for brevity, the debugger acts as if all names declared in
user-written packages are directly visible, even if they are not visible
according to Ada rules, thus making it unnecessary to fully qualify most
names with their packages, regardless of context.  Where this causes
ambiguity, <span class="sc">gdb</span> asks the user's intent.

   <p>The debugger will start in Ada mode if it detects an Ada main program. 
As for other languages, it will enter Ada mode when stopped in a program that
was translated from an Ada source file.

   <p>While in Ada mode, you may use `<tt>&ndash;</tt>' for comments.  This is useful
mostly for documenting command files.  The standard <span class="sc">gdb</span> comment
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) still works at the beginning of a line in Ada mode, but not in the
middle (to allow based literals).

   <p>The debugger supports limited overloading.  Given a subprogram call in which
the function symbol has multiple definitions, it will use the number of
actual parameters and some information about their types to attempt to narrow
the set of definitions.  It also makes very limited use of context, preferring
procedures to functions in the context of the <code>call</code> command, and
functions to procedures elsewhere.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.2 Omissions from Ada</h5>

<p><a name="index-Ada_002c-omissions-from-1014"></a>
Here are the notable omissions from the subset:

     <ul>
<li>Only a subset of the attributes are supported:

          <ul>
<li><tt>'First</tt>, <tt>'Last</tt>, and <tt>'Length</tt>
 on array objects (not on types and subtypes).

          <li><tt>'Min</tt> and <tt>'Max</tt>.

          <li><tt>'Pos</tt> and <tt>'Val</tt>.

          <li><tt>'Tag</tt>.

          <li><tt>'Range</tt> on array objects (not subtypes), but only as the right
operand of the membership (<code>in</code>) operator.

          <li><tt>'Access</tt>, <tt>'Unchecked_Access</tt>, and
<tt>'Unrestricted_Access</tt> (a GNAT extension).

          <li><tt>'Address</tt>. 
</ul>

     <li>The names in
<code>Characters.Latin_1</code> are not available and
concatenation is not implemented.  Thus, escape characters in strings are
not currently available.

     <li>Equality tests (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/=</span></samp>&rsquo;) on arrays test for bitwise
equality of representations.  They will generally work correctly
for strings and arrays whose elements have integer or enumeration types. 
They may not work correctly for arrays whose element
types have user-defined equality, for arrays of real values
(in particular, IEEE-conformant floating point, because of negative
zeroes and NaNs), and for arrays whose elements contain unused bits with
indeterminate values.

     <li>The other component-by-component array operations (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
<code>xor</code>, <code>not</code>, and relational tests other than equality)
are not implemented.

     <li><a name="index-array-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029-1015"></a><a name="index-record-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029-1016"></a><a name="index-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029-1017"></a>There is limited support for array and record aggregates.  They are
permitted only on the right sides of assignments, as in these examples:

          (gdb) set An_Array := (0|4 =&gt; 1, 1..3 =&gt; 2, 5 =&gt; 6)
          (gdb) set A_2D_Array := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
          (gdb) set A_Record := (1, "Peter", True);
          (gdb) set A_Record := (Name =&gt; "Peter", Id =&gt; 1, Alive =&gt; True)
</pre>
     <p>Changing a
discriminant's value by assigning an aggregate has an
undefined effect if that discriminant is used within the record. 
However, you can first modify discriminants by directly assigning to
them (which normally would not be allowed in Ada), and then performing an
aggregate assignment.  For example, given a variable <code>A_Rec</code>
declared to have a type such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          type Rec (Len : Small_Integer := 0) is record
              Id : Integer;
              Vals : IntArray (1 .. Len);
          end record;
</pre>
     <p>you can assign a value with a different size of <code>Vals</code> with two
assignments:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set A_Rec.Len := 4
          (gdb) set A_Rec := (Id =&gt; 42, Vals =&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4))
</pre>
     <p>As this example also illustrates, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is very loose about the usual
rules concerning aggregates.  You may leave out some of the
components of an array or record aggregate (such as the <code>Len</code>
component in the assignment to <code>A_Rec</code> above); they will retain their
original values upon assignment.  You may freely use dynamic values as
indices in component associations.  You may even use overlapping or
redundant component associations, although which component values are
assigned in such cases is not defined.

     <li>Calls to dispatching subprograms are not implemented.

     <li>The overloading algorithm is much more limited (i.e., less selective)
than that of real Ada.  It makes only limited use of the context in
which a subexpression appears to resolve its meaning, and it is much
looser in its rules for allowing type matches.  As a result, some
function calls will be ambiguous, and the user will be asked to choose
the proper resolution.

     <li>The <code>new</code> operator is not implemented.

     <li>Entry calls are not implemented.

     <li>Aside from printing, arithmetic operations on the native VAX floating-point
formats are not supported.

     <li>It is not possible to slice a packed array.

     <li>The names <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, when not part of a qualified name,
are interpreted as if implicitly prefixed by <code>Standard</code>, regardless of
context. 
Should your program
redefine these names in a package or procedure (at best a dubious practice),
you will have to use fully qualified names to access their new definitions.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.3 Additions to Ada</h5>

<p><a name="index-Ada_002c-deviations-from-1018"></a>
As it does for other languages, <span class="sc">gdb</span> makes certain generic
extensions to Ada (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>):

     <ul>
<li>If the expression <var>E</var> is a variable residing in memory (typically
a local variable or array element) and <var>N</var> is a positive integer,
then <var>E</var><code>@</code><var>N</var> displays the values of <var>E</var> and the
<var>N</var>-1 adjacent variables following it in memory as an array.  In
Ada, this operator is generally not necessary, since its prime use is
in displaying parts of an array, and slicing will usually do this in
Ada.  However, there are occasional uses when debugging programs in
which certain debugging information has been optimized away.

     <li><var>B</var><code>::</code><var>var</var> means &ldquo;the variable named <var>var</var> that
appears in function or file <var>B</var>.&rdquo;  When <var>B</var> is a file name,
you must typically surround it in single quotes.

     <li>The expression <code>{</code><var>type</var><code>} </code><var>addr</var> means &ldquo;the variable of type
<var>type</var> that appears at address <var>addr</var>.&rdquo;

     <li>A name starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; is a convenience variable
(see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Vars</a>) or a machine register (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>In addition, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a few other shortcuts and outright
additions specific to Ada:

     <ul>
<li>The assignment statement is allowed as an expression, returning
its right-hand operand as its value.  Thus, you may enter

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) set x := y + 3
          (gdb) print A(tmp := y + 1)
</pre>
     <li>The semicolon is allowed as an &ldquo;operator,&rdquo;  returning as its value
the value of its right-hand operand. 
This allows, for example,
complex conditional breaks:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) break f
          (gdb) condition 1 (report(i); k += 1; A(k) &gt; 100)
</pre>
     <li>Rather than use catenation and symbolic character names to introduce special
characters into strings, one may instead use a special bracket notation,
which is also used to print strings.  A sequence of characters of the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">["</span><var>XX</var><span class="samp">"]</span></samp>&rsquo; within a string or character literal denotes the
(single) character whose numeric encoding is <var>XX</var> in hexadecimal.  The
sequence of characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">["""]</span></samp>&rsquo; also denotes a single quotation mark
in strings.   For example,
     <pre class="smallexample">             "One line.["0a"]Next line.["0a"]"
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">contains an ASCII newline character (<code>Ada.Characters.Latin_1.LF</code>)
after each period.

     <li>The subtype used as a prefix for the attributes <tt>'Pos</tt>, <tt>'Min</tt>, and
<tt>'Max</tt> is optional (and is ignored in any case).  For example, it is valid
to write

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) print 'max(x, y)
</pre>
     <li>When printing arrays, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses positional notation when the
array has a lower bound of 1, and uses a modified named notation otherwise. 
For example, a one-dimensional array of three integers with a lower bound
of 3 might print as

     <pre class="smallexample">          (3 =&gt; 10, 17, 1)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">That is, in contrast to valid Ada, only the first component has a <code>=&gt;</code>
clause.

     <li>You may abbreviate attributes in expressions with any unique,
multi-character subsequence of
their names (an exact match gets preference). 
For example, you may use <tt>a'len</tt>, <tt>a'gth</tt>, or <tt>a'lh</tt>
in place of  <tt>a'length</tt>.

     <li><a name="index-quoting-Ada-internal-identifiers-1019"></a>Since Ada is case-insensitive, the debugger normally maps identifiers you type
to lower case.  The GNAT compiler uses upper-case characters for
some of its internal identifiers, which are normally of no interest to users. 
For the rare occasions when you actually have to look at them,
enclose them in angle brackets to avoid the lower-case mapping. 
For example,
     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) print &lt;JMPBUF_SAVE&gt;[0]
</pre>
     <li>Printing an object of class-wide type or dereferencing an
access-to-class-wide value will display all the components of the object's
specific type (as indicated by its run-time tag).  Likewise, component
selection on such a value will operate on the specific type of the
object.

<p><a name="index-breakpointing-Ada-elaboration-code-1020"></a>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration, and
before reaching the main procedure. 
As defined in the Ada Reference

<code>adainit</code>.  To run your program up to the beginning of
elaboration, simply use the following two commands:
<code>tbreak adainit</code> and <code>run</code>.

<dl><dt><code>info exceptions</code><dt><code>info exceptions </code><var>regexp</var><dd>The <code>info exceptions</code> command allows you to list all Ada exceptions

<p><a name="index-Ada-tasking-and-core-file-debugging-1031"></a>
When inspecting a core file, as opposed to debugging a live program,
tasking support may be limited or even unavailable, depending on
the platform being used. 
For instance, on x86-linux, the list of tasks is available, but task
switching is not supported.

   <p>On certain platforms, the debugger needs to perform some
memory writes in order to provide Ada tasking support.  When inspecting
a core file, this means that the core file must be opened with read-write
privileges, using the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"set write on"</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="#Patching">Patching</a>). 
Under these circumstances, you should make a backup copy of the core

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.9 Debugging Generic Units</h5>

<p><a name="index-Ada_002c-generic-units-1037"></a>
GNAT always uses code expansion for generic instantiation.  This means that
each time an instantiation occurs, a complete copy of the original code is
made with appropriate substitutions.

   <p>It is not possible to refer to the original generic entities themselves
in <span class="sc">gdb</span> (there is no code to refer to), but it
is certainly possible to debug a particular instance of a generic, simply by
using the appropriate expanded names.  For example, suppose that
<code>Gen</code> is a generic package:

<pre class="smallexample">     -- In file gen.ads:
     generic package Gen is
        function F (v1 : Integer) return Integer;
     end Gen;
     
     -- In file gen.adb:
     package body Gen is
        function F (v1 : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
           return v1+1;         -- Line 5
        end F;
     end Gen;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and we have the following expansions

<pre class="smallexample">     with Gen;
     procedure G is
        package Gen1 is new Gen;
        package Gen2 is new Gen;
     
        I : Integer := 0;
     begin
        I := Gen1.F (I);
        I := Gen2.F (I);
        I := Gen1.F (I);
        I := Gen2.F (I);
     end;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then to break on a call to procedure <code>F</code> in the <code>Gen2</code> instance, simply
use the command:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break G.Gen2.F
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To break at a particular line in a particular generic instance, say the return
statement in <code>G.Gen2</code>, append the line specification to the file and
function name:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break gen.adb:G.Gen2.F:5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To break on this line line in <em>all</em> instances of <code>Gen</code>, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;
as the function name:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break gen.adb:*:5
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will set individual breakpoints at all instances; they are independent of
each other and you may remove, conditionalize, or otherwise modify them
individually.

   <p>When a breakpoint occurs, you can step through the code of the generic
instance in the normal manner.  You can also examine values of data in the
normal manner, providing the appropriate generic package qualification to
refer to non-local entities.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.10 Set commands for Ada</h5>

<p>Ada introduces new <code>set</code> commands.

     
<a name="index-set-varsize_002dlimit-1038"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set varsize-limit </code><var>size</var><dd>Limit the size of the types of objects to <var>size</var> bytes
when those sizes are computed from run-time quantities. 
When this limit is set to 0, there is no
limit.  By default, it is about 65K.  The purpose of having such a limit is
to prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from trying to grab enormous chunks of virtual
memory when asked to evaluate a quantity whose bounds have been corrupted
or have not yet been fully initialized. 
The limit applies to the results
of some subexpressions as well as to complete expressions.  For example, an
expression denoting a simple integer component, such as <code>x.y.z</code>, may
fail if the size of <var>x.y</var> is dynamic and exceeds <var>size</var>. 
On the other hand, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is sometimes clever;
the expression <code>A(i)</code>, where <var>A</var> is an
array variable with non-constant size, will generally succeed regardless of the
bounds on <var>A</var>, as long as the component size is less than <var>size</var>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.4.9.11 Known Peculiarities of Ada Mode</h5>

<p><a name="index-Ada_002c-problems-1040"></a>
Besides the omissions listed previously (see <a href="#Omissions-from-Ada">Omissions from Ada</a>),
we know of several problems with and limitations of Ada mode in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>,
some of which will be fixed with planned future releases of the debugger
and the GNU Ada compiler.

     <ul>
<li>Static constants that the compiler chooses not to materialize as objects in
storage are invisible to the debugger.

     <li>Named parameter associations in function argument lists are ignored (the
argument lists are treated as positional).

     <li>Many useful library packages are currently invisible to the debugger.

     <li>Fixed-point arithmetic, conversions, input, and output is carried out using
floating-point arithmetic, and may give results that only approximate those on
the host machine.

     <li>When stopped in a particular subprogram, you can access variables defined
in other, lexically
enclosing subprograms by their simple names.  At the moment, however, this
may not always work; it depends on whether the compiler happens to have
made the necessary information (the &ldquo;static link&rdquo;) available
at execution time, which it can sometimes avoid.  Of course,
even in those cases where
the compiler does not provide the information, you can still look at such
variables by issuing the appropriate number of <code>up</code> commands to get to
frame containing the variable you wish to see. 
Access to non-local variables does not, at the moment, work in
the test expressions for conditional breakpoints
(see <a href="#Conditions">Break conditions</a>) unless you happen to specify these
while stopped in the subprogram in which they are to be applied.

     <li>The GNAT compiler never generates the prefix <code>Standard</code> for any of
the standard symbols defined by the Ada language.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows about
this: it will strip the prefix from names when you use it, and will never
look for a name you have so qualified among local symbols, nor match against
symbols in other packages or subprograms.  If you have
defined entities anywhere in your program other than parameters and
local variables whose simple names match names in <code>Standard</code>,
GNAT's lack of qualification here can cause confusion.  When this happens,
you can usually resolve the confusion
by qualifying the problematic names with package
<code>Standard</code> explicitly. 
</ul>

   <p>Older versions of the compiler sometimes generate erroneous debugging
information, resulting in the debugger incorrectly printing the value
of affected entities.  In some cases, the debugger is able to work
around an issue automatically. In other cases, the debugger is able
to work around the issue, but the work-around has to be specifically
enabled.

   <p><a name="index-set-ada-trust_002dPAD_002dover_002dXVS-1041"></a><a name="index-show-ada-trust_002dPAD_002dover_002dXVS-1042"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS on</code><dd>Configure GDB to strictly follow the GNAT encoding when computing the
value of Ada entities, particularly when <code>PAD</code> and <code>PAD___XVS</code>
types are involved (see <code>ada/exp_dbug.ads</code> in the GCC sources for
a complete description of the encoding used by the GNAT compiler). 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS off</code><dd>This is related to the encoding using by the GNAT compiler.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span>
sometimes prints the wrong value for certain entities, changing <code>ada
trust-PAD-over-XVS</code> to <code>off</code> activates a work-around which may fix
the issue.  It is always safe to set <code>ada trust-PAD-over-XVS</code> to
<code>off</code>, but this incurs a slight performance penalty, so it is
recommended to leave this setting to <code>on</code> unless necessary.

   </dl>

   <p><a name="index-GNAT-descriptive-types-1043"></a><a name="index-GNAT-encoding-1044"></a>Internally, the debugger also relies on the compiler following a number
of conventions known as the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GNAT Encoding</span></samp>&rsquo;, all documented in
<samp><span class="file">gcc/ada/exp_dbug.ads</span></samp> in the GCC sources. This encoding describes
how the debugging information should be generated for certain types. 
In particular, this convention makes use of <dfn>descriptive types</dfn>,
which are artificial types generated purely to help the debugger.

   <p>These encodings were defined at a time when the debugging information
format used was not powerful enough to describe some of the more complex
types available in Ada.  Since DWARF allows us to express nearly all
Ada features, the long-term goal is to slowly replace these descriptive
types by their pure DWARF equivalent.  To facilitate that transition,
a new maintenance option is available to force the debugger to ignore
those descriptive types.  It allows the user to quickly evaluate how
well <span class="sc">gdb</span> works without them.

<span class="sc">gdb</span> also provides a pseudo-language, called <code>minimal</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">16 Examining the Symbol Table</h2>

<p>The commands described in this chapter allow you to inquire about the
symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your
program.  This information is inherent in the text of your program and
does not change as your program executes.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds it in your
program's symbol table, in the file indicated when you started <span class="sc">gdb</span>
(see <a href="#File-Options">Choosing Files</a>), or by one of the
file-management commands (see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

   <p><a name="index-symbol-names-1049"></a><a name="index-names-of-symbols-1050"></a><a name="index-quoting-names-1051"></a>Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual
characters, which <span class="sc">gdb</span> ordinarily treats as word delimiters.  The
most frequent case is in referring to static variables in other
source files (see <a href="#Variables">Program Variables</a>).  File names
are recorded in object files as debugging symbols, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> would
ordinarily parse a typical file name, like <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>, as the three words
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to recognize
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.c</span></samp>&rsquo; as a single symbol, enclose it in single quotes; for example,

<pre class="smallexample">     p 'foo.c'::x
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">looks up the value of <code>x</code> in the scope of the file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>.

with case sensitivity determined by the current source language. 
Occasionally, you may wish to control that.  The command <code>set
case-sensitive</code> lets you do that by specifying <code>on</code> for
case-sensitive matches or <code>off</code> for case-insensitive ones.  If
you specify <code>auto</code>, case sensitivity is reset to the default
suitable for the source language.  The default is case-sensitive
matches for all languages except for Fortran, for which the default is
case-insensitive matches.

     <p>If <var>arg</var> is an expression (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>), it
is not actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such as
assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.

     <p>If <var>arg</var> is a variable or an expression, <code>whatis</code> prints its
literal type as it is used in the source code.  If the type was
defined using a <code>typedef</code>, <code>whatis</code> will <em>not</em> print
the data type underlying the <code>typedef</code>.  If the type of the
variable or the expression is a compound data type, such as
<code>struct</code> or  <code>class</code>, <code>whatis</code> never prints their
fields or methods.  It just prints the <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code>
name (a.k.a. its <dfn>tag</dfn>).  If you want to see the members of
such a compound data type, use <code>ptype</code>.

     <p>If <var>arg</var> is a type name that was defined using <code>typedef</code>,
<code>whatis</code> <dfn>unrolls</dfn> only one level of that <code>typedef</code>. 
Unrolling means that <code>whatis</code> will show the underlying type used
in the <code>typedef</code> declaration of <var>arg</var>.  However, if that
underlying type is also a <code>typedef</code>, <code>whatis</code> will not
unroll it.

     <p>For C code, the type names may also have the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">class

     <p><var>flags</var> can be used to modify how the type is displayed. 
Available flags are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>r</code><dd>Display in &ldquo;raw&rdquo; form.  Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> substitutes template
parameters and typedefs defined in a class when printing the class'
members.  The <code>/r</code> flag disables this.

          <br><dt><code>m</code><dd>Do not print methods defined in the class.

          <br><dt><code>M</code><dd>Print methods defined in the class.  This is the default, but the flag
exists in case you change the default with <samp><span class="command">set print type methods</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Do not print typedefs defined in the class.  Note that this controls
whether the typedef definition itself is printed, not whether typedef
names are substituted when printing other types.

          <br><dt><code>T</code><dd>Print typedefs defined in the class.  This is the default, but the flag
exists in case you change the default with <samp><span class="command">set print type typedefs</span></samp>. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-ptype-1068"></a><br><dt><code>ptype[/</code><var>flags</var><code>] [</code><var>arg</var><code>]</code><dd><code>ptype</code> accepts the same arguments as <code>whatis</code>, but prints a
detailed description of the type, instead of just the name of the type. 
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.

     <p>Contrary to <code>whatis</code>, <code>ptype</code> always unrolls any
<code>typedef</code>s in its argument declaration, whether the argument is
a variable, expression, or a data type.  This means that <code>ptype</code>
of a variable or an expression will not print literally its type as
present in the source code&mdash;use <code>whatis</code> for that.  <code>typedef</code>s at
the pointer or reference targets are also unrolled.  Only <code>typedef</code>s of

</pre>
     <p class="noindent">As with <code>whatis</code>, using <code>ptype</code> without an argument refers to
the type of <code>$</code>, the last value in the value history.

of complex data structure.  If the debug information included in the
program does not allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to display a full declaration of
the data type, it will say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;incomplete type&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example,
given these declarations:

              struct foo *fooptr;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">but no definition for <code>struct foo</code> itself, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will say:

</pre>
     <p class="noindent">&ldquo;Incomplete type&rdquo; is C terminology for data types that are not

correct results in the rest of the run.  You can find the answer by
experiment, using the <span class="sc">gdb</span> features for altering execution of the
program.

   <p>For example, you can store new values into variables or memory
locations, give your program a signal, restart it at a different

<h3 class="section">17.1 Assignment to Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-assignment-1110"></a><a name="index-setting-variables-1111"></a>To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression. 
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     print x=4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">stores the value 4 into the variable <code>x</code>, and then prints the
value of the assignment expression (which is 4). 
See <a href="#Languages">Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> with Different Languages</a>, for more
information on operators in supported languages.

   <p><a name="index-set-variable-1112"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-setting-1113"></a>If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment, use the
<code>set</code> command instead of the <code>print</code> command.  <code>set</code> is
really the same as <code>print</code> except that the expression's value is
not printed and is not put in the value history (see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>).  The expression is evaluated only for its effects.

   <p>If the beginning of the argument string of the <code>set</code> command
appears identical to a <code>set</code> subcommand, use the <code>set
variable</code> command instead of just <code>set</code>.  This command is identical
to <code>set</code> except for its lack of subcommands.  For example, if your
program has a variable <code>width</code>, you get an error if you try to set
a new value with just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set width=13</span></samp>&rsquo;, because <span class="sc">gdb</span> has the
command <code>set width</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) whatis width
     type = double
     (gdb) p width
     $4 = 13
     (gdb) set width=47
     Invalid syntax in expression.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The invalid expression, of course, is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=47</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In
order to actually set the program's variable <code>width</code>, use

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set var width=47
</pre>
   <p>Because the <code>set</code> command has many subcommands that can conflict
with the names of program variables, it is a good idea to use the
<code>set variable</code> command instead of just <code>set</code>.  For example, if
your program has a variable <code>g</code>, you run into problems if you try
to set a new value with just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set g=4</span></samp>&rsquo;, because <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
the command <code>set gnutarget</code>, abbreviated <code>set g</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) whatis g
     type = double
     (gdb) p g
     $1 = 1
     (gdb) set g=4
     (gdb) p g
     $2 = 1
     (gdb) r
     The program being debugged has been started already.
     Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
     Starting program: /home/smith/cc_progs/a.out
     "/home/smith/cc_progs/a.out": can't open to read symbols:
                                      Invalid bfd target.
     (gdb) show g
     The current BFD target is "=4".
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The program variable <code>g</code> did not change, and you silently set the
<code>gnutarget</code> to an invalid value.  In order to set the variable
<code>g</code>, use

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) set var g=4
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows more implicit conversions in assignments than C; you can
freely store an integer value into a pointer variable or vice versa,
and you can convert any structure to any other structure that is the
same length or shorter. 
<!-- FIXME: how do structs align/pad in these conversions? -->
<!-- /doc@cygnus.com 18dec1990 -->

   <p>To store values into arbitrary places in memory, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{...}</span></samp>&rsquo;
construct to generate a value of specified type at a specified address
(see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  For example, <code>{int}0x83040</code> refers
to memory location <code>0x83040</code> as an integer (which implies a certain size
and representation in memory), and

<pre class="smallexample">     set {int}0x83040 = 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">stores the value 4 into that memory location.

<h3 class="section">17.2 Continuing at a Different Address</h3>

<p>Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where
it stopped, with the <code>continue</code> command.  You can instead continue at
an address of your own choosing, with the following commands:

     
<a name="index-jump-1114"></a>
<a name="index-j-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007bjump_007d_0029_007d-1115"></a>
<dl><dt><code>jump </code><var>linespec</var><dt><code>j </code><var>linespec</var><dt><code>jump </code><var>location</var><dt><code>j </code><var>location</var><dd>Resume execution at line <var>linespec</var> or at address given by
<var>location</var>.  Execution stops again immediately if there is a
breakpoint there.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for a description of the
different forms of <var>linespec</var> and <var>location</var>.  It is common
practice to use the <code>tbreak</code> command in conjunction with
<code>jump</code>.  See <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>.

     <p>The <code>jump</code> command does not change the current stack frame, or
the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.  If line <var>linespec</var> is in
a different function from the one currently executing, the results may
be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns of arguments or
of local variables.  For this reason, the <code>jump</code> command requests
confirmation if the specified line is not in the function currently
executing.  However, even bizarre results are predictable if you are
well acquainted with the machine-language code of your program. 
</dl>

<!-- Doesn't work on HP-UX; have to set $pcoqh and $pcoqt. -->
   <p>On many systems, you can get much the same effect as the <code>jump</code>
command by storing a new value into the register <code>$pc</code>.  The
difference is that this does not start your program running; it only
changes the address of where it <em>will</em> run when you continue.  For
example,

<pre class="smallexample">     set $pc = 0x485
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">makes the next <code>continue</code> command or stepping command execute at
address <code>0x485</code>, rather than at the address where your program stopped. 
See <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.

   <p>The most common occasion to use the <code>jump</code> command is to back
up&mdash;perhaps with more breakpoints set&mdash;over a portion of a program
that has already executed, in order to examine its execution in more
detail.

<h3 class="section">17.3 Giving your Program a Signal</h3>

<a name="index-signal-1117"></a>
<dl><dt><code>signal </code><var>signal</var><dd>Resume execution where your program is stopped, but immediately give it the
signal <var>signal</var>.  The <var>signal</var> can be the name or the number of a
signal.  For example, on many systems <code>signal 2</code> and <code>signal
SIGINT</code> are both ways of sending an interrupt signal.

     <p>Alternatively, if <var>signal</var> is zero, continue execution without
giving a signal.  This is useful when your program stopped on account of
a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the
<code>continue</code> command; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal 0</span></samp>&rsquo; causes it to resume without a
signal.

     <p><em>Note:</em> When resuming a multi-threaded program, <var>signal</var> is
delivered to the currently selected thread, not the thread that last
reported a stop.  This includes the situation where a thread was
stopped due to a signal.  So if you want to continue execution
suppressing the signal that stopped a thread, you should select that

the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal 0</span></samp>&rsquo; command with another thread as the selected one,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> detects that and asks for confirmation.

     <p>Invoking the <code>signal</code> command is not the same as invoking the
<code>kill</code> utility from the shell.  Sending a signal with <code>kill</code>
causes <span class="sc">gdb</span> to decide what to do with the signal depending on
the signal handling tables (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).  The <code>signal</code> command
passes the signal directly to your program.

     <p><code>signal</code> does not repeat when you press &lt;RET&gt; a second time
after executing the command.

     <p><a name="index-queue_002dsignal-1118"></a><br><dt><code>queue-signal </code><var>signal</var><dd>Queue <var>signal</var> to be delivered immediately to the current thread
when execution of the thread resumes.  The <var>signal</var> can be the name or
the number of a signal.  For example, on many systems <code>signal 2</code> and
<code>signal SIGINT</code> are both ways of sending an interrupt signal. 
The handling of the signal must be set to pass the signal to the program,
otherwise <span class="sc">gdb</span> will report an error. 
You can control the handling of signals from <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the
<code>handle</code> command (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).

     <p>Alternatively, if <var>signal</var> is zero, any currently queued signal
for the current thread is discarded and when execution resumes no signal
will be delivered.  This is useful when your program stopped on account
of a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the
<code>continue</code> command.

     <p>This command differs from the <code>signal</code> command in that the signal
is just queued, execution is not resumed.  And <code>queue-signal</code> cannot
be used to pass a signal whose handling state has been set to <code>nopass</code>
(see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).

<h3 class="section">17.4 Returning from a Function</h3>

     
<a name="index-returning-from-a-function-1119"></a>
<a name="index-return-1120"></a>
<dl><dt><code>return</code><dt><code>return </code><var>expression</var><dd>You can cancel execution of a function call with the <code>return</code>
command.  If you give an
<var>expression</var> argument, its value is used as the function's return
value. 
</dl>

   <p>When you use <code>return</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> discards the selected stack frame
(and all frames within it).  You can think of this as making the
discarded frame return prematurely.  If you wish to specify a value to
be returned, give that value as the argument to <code>return</code>.

   <p>This pops the selected stack frame (see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>), and any other frames inside of it, leaving its caller as the
innermost remaining frame.  That frame becomes selected.  The
specified value is stored in the registers used for returning values
of functions.

   <p>The <code>return</code> command does not resume execution; it leaves the
program stopped in the state that would exist if the function had just
returned.  In contrast, the <code>finish</code> command (see <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>) resumes execution until the
selected stack frame returns naturally.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to know how the <var>expression</var> argument should be set for
the inferior.  The concrete registers assignment depends on the OS ABI and the
type being returned by the selected stack frame.  For example it is common for
OS ABI to return floating point values in FPU registers while integer values in
CPU registers.  Still some ABIs return even floating point values in CPU
registers.  Larger integer widths (such as <code>long long int</code>) also have
specific placement rules.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> already knows the OS ABI from its
current target so it needs to find out also the type being returned to make the
assignment into the right register(s).

   <p>Normally, the selected stack frame has debug info.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will always
use the debug info instead of the implicit type of <var>expression</var> when the
debug info is available.  For example, if you type <kbd>return -1</kbd>, and the
function in the current stack frame is declared to return a <code>long long
int</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> transparently converts the implicit <code>int</code> value of -1
into a <code>long long int</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     Breakpoint 1, func () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:29
     29        return 31;
     (gdb) return -1
     Make func return now? (y or n) y
     #0  0x004004f6 in main () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:43
     43        printf ("result=%lld\n", func ());
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>However, if the selected stack frame does not have a debug info, e.g., if the
function was compiled without debug info, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has to find out the type
to return from user.  Specifying a different type by mistake may set the value
in different inferior registers than the caller code expects.  For example,
typing <kbd>return -1</kbd> with its implicit type <code>int</code> would set only a part
of a <code>long long int</code> result for a debug info less function (on 32-bit
architectures).  Therefore the user is required to specify the return type by
an appropriate cast explicitly:

<pre class="smallexample">     Breakpoint 2, 0x0040050b in func ()
     (gdb) return -1
     Return value type not available for selected stack frame.
     Please use an explicit cast of the value to return.
     (gdb) return (long long int) -1
     Make selected stack frame return now? (y or n) y
     #0  0x00400526 in main ()
     (gdb)

<h3 class="section">17.7 Compiling and injecting code in <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-injecting-code-1138"></a><a name="index-writing-into-executables-1139"></a><a name="index-compiling-code-1140"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> supports on-demand compilation and code injection into
programs running under <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  GCC 5.0 or higher built with
<samp><span class="file">libcc1.so</span></samp> must be installed for this functionality to be enabled. 
This functionality is implemented with the following commands.

     
<a name="index-compile-code-1141"></a>
<dl><dt><code>compile code </code><var>source-code</var><dt><code>compile code -raw </code><var>&ndash;</var> <var>source-code</var><dd>Compile <var>source-code</var> with the compiler language found as the current
language in <span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="#Languages">Languages</a>).  If compilation and
injection is not supported with the current language specified in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>, or the compiler does not support this feature, an error
message will be printed.  If <var>source-code</var> compiles and links
successfully, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will load the object-code emitted,
and execute it within the context of the currently selected inferior. 
It is important to note that the compiled code is executed immediately. 
After execution, the compiled code is removed from <span class="sc">gdb</span> and any
new types or variables you have defined will be deleted.

     <p>The command allows you to specify <var>source-code</var> in two ways. 
The simplest method is to provide a single line of code to the command. 
E.g.:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code printf ("hello world\n");
</pre>
     <p>If you specify options on the command line as well as source code, they
may conflict.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo; delimiter can be used to separate options
from actual source code.  E.g.:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code -r -- printf ("hello world\n");
</pre>
     <p>Alternatively you can enter source code as multiple lines of text.  To
enter this mode, invoke the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">compile code</span></samp>&rsquo; command without any text
following the command.  This will start the multiple-line editor and
allow you to type as many lines of source code as required.  When you
have completed typing, enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">end</span></samp>&rsquo; on its own line to exit the
editor.

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code
          &gt;printf ("hello\n");
          &gt;printf ("world\n");
          &gt;end
</pre>
     <p>Specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-raw</span></samp>&rsquo;, prohibits <span class="sc">gdb</span> from wrapping the
provided <var>source-code</var> in a callable scope.  In this case, you must
specify the entry point of the code by defining a function named
<code>_gdb_expr_</code>.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-raw</span></samp>&rsquo; code cannot access variables of the
inferior.  Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-raw</span></samp>&rsquo; option may be needed for example when
<var>source-code</var> requires &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; lines which may conflict with
inferior symbols otherwise.

you can choose a different format by specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span><var>f</var></samp>&rsquo;, where

<h4 class="subsection">17.7.1 Compilation options for the <code>compile</code> command</h4>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to specify the right compilation options for the code
to be injected, in part to make its ABI compatible with the inferior
and in part to make the injected code compatible with <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
injecting process.

<p class="noindent">The options used, in increasing precedence:

     <dl>
<dt>target architecture and OS options (<code>gdbarch</code>)<dd>These options depend on target processor type and target operating
system, usually they specify at least 32-bit (<code>-m32</code>) or 64-bit
(<code>-m64</code>) compilation option.

     <br><dt>compilation options recorded in the target<dd><span class="sc">gcc</span> (since version 4.7) stores the options used for compilation

explicitly specify <code>-g</code> during inferior compilation otherwise
<span class="sc">gcc</span> produces no DWARF.  This feature is only relevant for
platforms where <code>-g</code> produces DWARF by default, otherwise one may
try to enforce DWARF by using <code>-gdwarf-4</code>.

</dl>

<h4 class="subsection">17.7.2 Caveats when using the <code>compile</code> command</h4>

<p>There are a few caveats to keep in mind when using the <code>compile</code>
command.  As the caveats are different per language, the table below
highlights specific issues on a per language basis.

     <dl>
<dt>C code examples and caveats<dd>When the language in <span class="sc">gdb</span> is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, the compiler will
attempt to compile the source code with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler.  The source
code provided to the <code>compile</code> command will have much the same
access to variables and types as it normally would if it were part of
the program currently being debugged in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>Below is a sample program that forms the basis of the examples that
follow.  This program has been compiled and loaded into <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
much like any other normal debugging session.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void function1 (void)
          {
             int i = 42;
             printf ("function 1\n");
          }
          
          void function2 (void)
          {
             int j = 12;
             function1 ();
          }
          
          int main(void)
          {
             int k = 6;
             int *p;
             function2 ();
             return 0;
          }
</pre>
     <p>For the purposes of the examples in this section, the program above has
been compiled, loaded into <span class="sc">gdb</span>, stopped at the function
<code>main</code>, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> is awaiting input from the user.

     <p>To access variables and types for any program in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the
program must be compiled and packaged with debug information.  The
<code>compile</code> command is not an exception to this rule.  Without debug
information, you can still use the <code>compile</code> command, but you will
be very limited in what variables and types you can access.

     <p>So with that in mind, the example above has been compiled with debug
information enabled.  The <code>compile</code> command will have access to
all variables and types (except those that may have been optimized
out).  Currently, as <span class="sc">gdb</span> has stopped the program in the
<code>main</code> function, the <code>compile</code> command would have access to
the variable <code>k</code>.  You could invoke the <code>compile</code> command
and type some source code to set the value of <code>k</code>.  You can also
read it, or do anything with that variable you would normally do in
<code>C</code>.  Be aware that changes to inferior variables in the
<code>compile</code> command are persistent.  In the following example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code k = 3;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the variable <code>k</code> is now 3.  It will retain that value until
something else in the example program changes it, or another
<code>compile</code> command changes it.

     <p>Normal scope and access rules apply to source code compiled and
injected by the <code>compile</code> command.  In the example, the variables
<code>j</code> and <code>k</code> are not accessible yet, because the program is
currently stopped in the <code>main</code> function, where these variables
are not in scope.  Therefore, the following command

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code j = 3;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">will result in a compilation error message.

     <p>Once the program is continued, execution will bring these variables in
scope, and they will become accessible; then the code you specify via
the <code>compile</code> command will be able to access them.

     <p>You can create variables and types with the <code>compile</code> command as
part of your source code.  Variables and types that are created as part
of the <code>compile</code> command are not visible to the rest of the program for
the duration of its run.  This example is valid:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code int ff = 5; printf ("ff is %d\n", ff);
</pre>
     <p>However, if you were to type the following into <span class="sc">gdb</span> after that
command has completed:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code printf ("ff is %d\n'', ff);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">a compiler error would be raised as the variable <code>ff</code> no longer
exists.  Object code generated and injected by the <code>compile</code>
command is removed when its execution ends.  Caution is advised
when assigning to program variables values of variables created by the
code submitted to the <code>compile</code> command.  This example is valid:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code int ff = 5; k = ff;
</pre>
     <p>The value of the variable <code>ff</code> is assigned to <code>k</code>.  The variable
<code>k</code> does not require the existence of <code>ff</code> to maintain the value
it has been assigned.  However, pointers require particular care in
assignment.  If the source code compiled with the <code>compile</code> command
changed the address of a pointer in the example program, perhaps to a
variable created in the <code>compile</code> command, that pointer would point
to an invalid location when the command exits.  The following example
would likely cause issues with your debugged program:

     <pre class="smallexample">          compile code int ff = 5; p = &amp;ff;
</pre>
     <p>In this example, <code>p</code> would point to <code>ff</code> when the
<code>compile</code> command is executing the source code provided to it. 
However, as variables in the (example) program persist with their
assigned values, the variable <code>p</code> would point to an invalid
location when the command exists.  A general rule should be followed
in that you should either assign <code>NULL</code> to any assigned pointers,
or restore a valid location to the pointer before the command exits.

     <p>Similar caution must be exercised with any structs, unions, and typedefs
defined in <code>compile</code> command.  Types defined in the <code>compile</code>
command will no longer be available in the next <code>compile</code> command. 
Therefore, if you cast a variable to a type defined in the
<code>compile</code> command, care must be taken to ensure that any future

<h3 class="section">18.1 Commands to Specify Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-table-1146"></a><a name="index-core-dump-file-1147"></a>
You may want to specify executable and core dump file names.  The usual
way to do this is at start-up time, using the arguments to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s start-up commands (see <a href="#Invocation">Getting In and Out of <span class="sc">gdb</span></a>).

   <p>Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session.  Or you may run <span class="sc">gdb</span> and forget to
specify a file you want to use.  Or you are debugging a remote target
via <code>gdbserver</code> (see <a href="#Server">file</a>).  In these situations the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands to specify
new files are useful.

     
<a name="index-executable-file-1148"></a>
<a name="index-file-1149"></a>
<dl><dt><code>file </code><var>filename</var><dd>Use <var>filename</var> as the program to be debugged.  It is read for its
symbols and for the contents of pure memory.  It is also the program
executed when you use the <code>run</code> command.  If you do not specify a
directory and the file is not found in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the environment variable <code>PATH</code> as a list of
directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a program
to run.  You can change the value of this variable, for both <span class="sc">gdb</span>
and your program, using the <code>path</code> command.

     <p><a name="index-unlinked-object-files-1150"></a><a name="index-patching-object-files-1151"></a>You can load unlinked object <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> files into <span class="sc">gdb</span> using
the <code>file</code> command.  You will not be able to &ldquo;run&rdquo; an object
file, but you can disassemble functions and inspect variables.  Also,
if the underlying BFD functionality supports it, you could use
<kbd>gdb -write</kbd> to patch object files using this technique.  Note
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> can neither interpret nor modify relocations in this
case, so branches and some initialized variables will appear to go to
the wrong place.  But this feature is still handy from time to time.

     <br><dt><code>file</code><dd><code>file</code> with no argument makes <span class="sc">gdb</span> discard any information it
has on both executable file and the symbol table.

     <p><a name="index-exec_002dfile-1152"></a><br><dt><code>exec-file </code><span class="roman">[</span> <var>filename</var> <span class="roman">]</span><dd>Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is found
in <var>filename</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches the environment variable <code>PATH</code>
if necessary to locate your program.  Omitting <var>filename</var> means to
discard information on the executable file.

     <p><a name="index-symbol_002dfile-1153"></a><br><dt><code>symbol-file </code><span class="roman">[</span> <var>filename</var> <span class="roman">]</span><dd>Read symbol table information from file <var>filename</var>.  <code>PATH</code> is
searched when necessary.  Use the <code>file</code> command to get both symbol
table and program to run from the same file.

     <p><code>symbol-file</code> with no argument clears out <span class="sc">gdb</span> information on your
program's symbol table.

     <p>The <code>symbol-file</code> command causes <span class="sc">gdb</span> to forget the contents of
some breakpoints and auto-display expressions.  This is because they may
contain pointers to the internal data recording symbols and data types,
which are part of the old symbol table data being discarded inside
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p><code>symbol-file</code> does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; again after
executing it once.

     <p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is configured for a particular environment, it
understands debugging information in whatever format is the standard
generated for that environment; you may use either a <span class="sc">gnu</span> compiler, or
other compilers that adhere to the local conventions. 
Best results are usually obtained from <span class="sc">gnu</span> compilers; for example,
using <span class="sc">gcc</span> you can generate debugging information for
optimized code.

     <p>For most kinds of object files, with the exception of old SVR3 systems
using COFF, the <code>symbol-file</code> command does not normally read the
symbol table in full right away.  Instead, it scans the symbol table
quickly to find which source files and which symbols are present.  The
details are read later, one source file at a time, as they are needed.

     <p>The purpose of this two-stage reading strategy is to make <span class="sc">gdb</span>
start up faster.  For the most part, it is invisible except for
occasional pauses while the symbol table details for a particular source
file are being read.  (The <code>set verbose</code> command can turn these
pauses into messages if desired.  See <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and Messages</a>.)

     <p>We have not implemented the two-stage strategy for COFF yet.  When the
symbol table is stored in COFF format, <code>symbol-file</code> reads the
symbol table data in full right away.  Note that &ldquo;stabs-in-COFF&rdquo;
still does the two-stage strategy, since the debug info is actually
in stabs format.

     <p><a name="index-readnow-1154"></a><a name="index-reading-symbols-immediately-1155"></a><a name="index-symbols_002c-reading-immediately-1156"></a><br><dt><code>symbol-file </code><span class="roman">[</span><code> -readnow </code><span class="roman">]</span> <var>filename</var><dt><code>file </code><span class="roman">[</span><code> -readnow </code><span class="roman">]</span> <var>filename</var><dd>You can override the <span class="sc">gdb</span> two-stage strategy for reading symbol
tables by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-readnow</span></samp>&rsquo; option with any of the commands that
load symbol table information, if you want to be sure <span class="sc">gdb</span> has the
entire symbol table available.

address space of the process that generated them; <span class="sc">gdb</span> can access the
executable file itself for other parts.

     <p><code>core-file</code> with no argument specifies that no core file is
to be used.

     <p>Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually running
under <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  So, if you have been running your program and you
wish to debug a core file instead, you must kill the subprocess in which
the program is running.  To do this, use the <code>kill</code> command
(see <a href="#Kill-Process">Killing the Child Process</a>).

address at which the file has been loaded; <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot figure
this out for itself.  You can additionally specify an arbitrary number
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s </span><var>section</var> <var>address</var></samp>&rsquo; pairs, to give an explicit
section name and base address for that section.  You can specify any

     <p>The symbol table of the file <var>filename</var> is added to the symbol table

provide these to the <code>add-symbol-file</code> command.

     <p class="noindent">Some embedded operating systems, like Sun Chorus and VxWorks, can load
relocatable files into an already running program; such systems
typically make the requirements above easy to meet.  However, it's
important to recognize that many native systems use complex link
procedures (<code>.linkonce</code> section factoring and C<tt>++</tt> constructor table
assembly, for example) that make the requirements difficult to meet.  In
general, one cannot assume that using <code>add-symbol-file</code> to read a
relocatable object file's symbolic information will have the same effect
as linking the relocatable object file into the program in the normal
way.

For example, the Linux kernel maps a <code>syscall DSO</code> into each

exec file does not contain section addresses, (such as in the
<code>a.out</code> format), or when the addresses specified in the file
itself are wrong.  Each section must be changed separately.  The
<code>info files</code> command, described below, lists all the sections and
their addresses.

   <p>All file-specifying commands allow both absolute and relative file names

   <p><a name="index-shared-libraries-1175"></a><a name="Shared-Libraries"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, MS-Windows, HP-UX, SunOS, SVr4, Irix,
and IBM RS/6000 AIX shared libraries.

   <p>On MS-Windows <span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support
shared libraries.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically loads symbol definitions from shared libraries
when you use the <code>run</code> command, or when you examine a core file. 
(Before you issue the <code>run</code> command, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not understand
references to a function in a shared library, however&mdash;unless you are
debugging a core file).

   <p>On HP-UX, if the program loads a library explicitly, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
automatically loads the symbols at the time of the <code>shl_load</code> call.

<!-- FIXME: some @value{GDBN} release may permit some refs to undef -->
<!-- FIXME...symbols-eg in a break cmd-assuming they are from a shared -->
<!-- FIXME...lib; check this from time to time when updating manual -->
   <p>There are times, however, when you may wish to not automatically load
symbol definitions from shared libraries, such as when they are
particularly large or there are many of them.

   <p>To control the automatic loading of shared library symbols, use the
commands:

     
<a name="index-set-auto_002dsolib_002dadd-1176"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set auto-solib-add </code><var>mode</var><dd>If <var>mode</var> is <code>on</code>, symbols from all shared object libraries
will be loaded automatically when the inferior begins execution, you
attach to an independently started inferior, or when the dynamic linker
informs <span class="sc">gdb</span> that a new library has been loaded.  If <var>mode</var>
is <code>off</code>, symbols must be loaded manually, using the
<code>sharedlibrary</code> command.  The default value is <code>on</code>.

     <p><a name="index-memory-used-for-symbol-tables-1177"></a>If your program uses lots of shared libraries with debug info that
takes large amounts of memory, you can decrease the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
memory footprint by preventing it from automatically loading the
symbols from shared libraries.  To that end, type <kbd>set
auto-solib-add off</kbd> before running the inferior, then load each
library whose debug symbols you do need with <kbd>sharedlibrary
</kbd><var>regexp</var>, where <var>regexp</var> is a regular expression that matches
the libraries whose symbols you want to be loaded.

     <p><a name="index-show-auto_002dsolib_002dadd-1178"></a><br><dt><code>show auto-solib-add</code><dd>Display the current autoloading mode.

   <p><a name="index-load-shared-library-1179"></a>To explicitly load shared library symbols, use the <code>sharedlibrary</code>

<dl><dt><code>info share </code><var>regex</var><dt><code>info sharedlibrary </code><var>regex</var><dd>Print the names of the shared libraries which are currently loaded

As with files loaded automatically, it only loads shared libraries

libraries that were loaded by explicit user requests are not
discarded. 
</dl>

   <p>Sometimes you may wish that <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops and gives you control
when any of shared library events happen.  The best way to do this is
to use <code>catch load</code> and <code>catch unload</code> (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>).

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> also supports the the <code>set stop-on-solib-events</code>
command for this.  This command exists for historical reasons.  It is
less useful than setting a catchpoint, because it does not allow for
conditions or commands as a catchpoint does.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set stop-on-solib-events</code><dd><a name="index-set-stop_002don_002dsolib_002devents-1187"></a>This command controls whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> should give you control

The most common event of interest is loading or unloading of a new
shared library.

     <br><dt><code>show stop-on-solib-events</code><dd><a name="index-show-stop_002don_002dsolib_002devents-1188"></a>Show whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops and gives you control when shared
library events happen. 
</dl>

   <p>Shared libraries are also supported in many cross or remote debugging
configurations.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to have access to the target's libraries;
this can be accomplished either by providing copies of the libraries
on the host system, or by asking <span class="sc">gdb</span> to automatically retrieve the
libraries from the target.  If copies of the target libraries are
provided, they need to be the same as the target libraries, although the
copies on the target can be stripped as long as the copies on the host are
not.

   <p><a name="index-where-to-look-for-shared-libraries-1189"></a>For remote debugging, you need to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> where the target
libraries are, so that it can load the correct copies&mdash;otherwise, it

to specify the search directories for target libraries.

<dl><dt><code>set sysroot </code><var>path</var><dd>Use <var>path</var> as the system root for the program being debugged.  Any
absolute shared library paths will be prefixed with <var>path</var>; many
runtime loaders store the absolute paths to the shared library in the
target program's memory.  When starting processes remotely, and when
attaching to already-running processes (local or remote), their
executable filenames will be prefixed with <var>path</var> if reported to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> as absolute by the operating system.  If you use
<code>set sysroot</code> to find executables and shared libraries, they need
to be laid out in the same way that they are on the target, with
e.g. a <samp><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">/lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp> hierarchy under
<var>path</var>.

     <p>If <var>path</var> starts with the sequence <samp><span class="file">target:</span></samp> and the target
system is remote then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will retrieve the target binaries
from the remote system.  This is only supported when using a remote
target that supports the <code>remote get</code> command (see <a href="#File-Transfer">Sending files to a remote system</a>).  The part of <var>path</var>
following the initial <samp><span class="file">target:</span></samp> (if present) is used as system
root prefix on the remote file system.  If <var>path</var> starts with the
sequence <samp><span class="file">remote:</span></samp> this is converted to the sequence
<samp><span class="file">target:</span></samp> by <code>set sysroot</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a>.  If you want
to specify a local system root using a directory that happens to be
named <samp><span class="file">target:</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">remote:</span></samp>, you need to use some
equivalent variant of the name like <samp><span class="file">./target:</span></samp>.

     <p>For targets with an MS-DOS based filesystem, such as MS-Windows and
SymbianOS, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries prefixing a few variants of the target
absolute file name with <var>path</var>.  But first, on Unix hosts,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> converts all backslash directory separators into forward
slashes, because the backslash is not a directory separator on Unix:

     <pre class="smallexample">            c:\foo\bar.dll &rArr; c:/foo/bar.dll
</pre>
     <p>Then, <span class="sc">gdb</span> attempts prefixing the target file name with
<var>path</var>, and looks for the resulting file name in the host file
system:

     <pre class="smallexample">            c:/foo/bar.dll &rArr; /path/to/sysroot/c:/foo/bar.dll
</pre>
     <p>If that does not find the binary, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries removing
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; character from the drive spec, both for convenience, and,
for the case of the host file system not supporting file names with
colons:

     <pre class="smallexample">            c:/foo/bar.dll &rArr; /path/to/sysroot/c/foo/bar.dll
</pre>
     <p>This makes it possible to have a system root that mirrors a target
with more than one drive.  E.g., you may want to setup your local
copies of the target system shared libraries like so (note &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; vs
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;):

     <pre class="smallexample">           <samp><span class="file">/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/foo.dll</span></samp>
           <samp><span class="file">/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/bar.dll</span></samp>
           <samp><span class="file">/path/to/sysroot/z/sys/bin/bar.dll</span></samp>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and point the system root at <samp><span class="file">/path/to/sysroot</span></samp>, so that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can find the correct copies of both
<samp><span class="file">c:\sys\bin\foo.dll</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">z:\sys\bin\bar.dll</span></samp>.

     <p>If that still does not find the binary, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries
removing the whole drive spec from the target file name:

     <pre class="smallexample">            c:/foo/bar.dll &rArr; /path/to/sysroot/foo/bar.dll
</pre>
     <p>This last lookup makes it possible to not care about the drive name,
if you don't want or need to.

     <p>The <code>set solib-absolute-prefix</code> command is an alias for <code>set
sysroot</code>.

     <p>Shared library file names as reported by the target system may not
make sense as is on the system <span class="sc">gdb</span> is running on.  For
example, when remote debugging a target that has MS-DOS based file
system semantics, from a Unix host, the target may be reporting to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> a list of loaded shared libraries with file names such as
<samp><span class="file">c:\Windows\kernel32.dll</span></samp>.  On Unix hosts, there's no concept of
drive letters, so the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c:\</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix is not normally understood as
indicating an absolute file name, and neither is the backslash
normally considered a directory separator character.  In that case,
the native file system would interpret this whole absolute file name
as a relative file name with no directory components.  This would make
it impossible to point <span class="sc">gdb</span> at a copy of the remote target's
shared libraries on the host using <code>set sysroot</code>, and impractical
with <code>set solib-search-path</code>.  Setting
<code>target-file-system-kind</code> to <code>dos-based</code> tells <span class="sc">gdb</span>
to interpret such file names similarly to how the target would, and to
map them to file names valid on <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s native file system
semantics.  The value of <var>kind</var> can be <code>"auto"</code>, in addition
to one of the supported file system kinds.  In that case, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
tries to determine the appropriate file system variant based on the
current target's operating system (see <a href="#ABI">Configuring the Current ABI</a>).  The supported file system settings are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>unix</code><dd>Instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to assume the target file system is of Unix
kind.  Only file names starting the forward slash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) character
are considered absolute, and the directory separator character is also
the forward slash.

          <br><dt><code>dos-based</code><dd>Instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to assume the target file system is DOS based. 
File names starting with either a forward slash, or a drive letter
followed by a colon (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c:</span></samp>&rsquo;), are considered absolute, and
both the slash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) and the backslash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;) characters are
considered directory separators.

          <br><dt><code>auto</code><dd>Instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use the file system kind associated with the
target operating system (see <a href="#ABI">Configuring the Current ABI</a>). 
This is the default. 
</dl>
     </dl>

   <p><a name="index-file-name-canonicalization-1202"></a><a name="index-base-name-differences-1203"></a>When processing file names provided by the user, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
frequently needs to compare them to the file names recorded in the
program's debug info.  Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> compares just the
<dfn>base names</dfn> of the files as strings, which is reasonably fast
even for very large programs.  (The base name of a file is the last
portion of its name, after stripping all the leading directories.) 
This shortcut in comparison is based upon the assumption that files
cannot have more than one base name.  This is usually true, but
references to files that use symlinks or similar filesystem
facilities violate that assumption.  If your program records files
using such facilities, or if you provide file names to <span class="sc">gdb</span>
using symlinks etc., you can set <code>basenames-may-differ</code> to
<code>true</code> to instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to completely canonicalize each

<span class="sc">gdb</span> allows you to put a program's debugging information in a
file separate from the executable itself, in a way that allows
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to find and load the debugging information automatically. 
Since debugging information can be very large&mdash;sometimes larger
than the executable code itself&mdash;some systems distribute debugging
information for their executables in separate files, which users can
install only when they need to debug a problem.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports two ways of specifying the separate debug info
file:

     <ul>
<li>The executable contains a <dfn>debug link</dfn> that specifies the name of
the separate debug info file.  The separate debug file's name is
usually <samp><var>executable</var><span class="file">.debug</span></samp>, where <var>executable</var> is the
name of the corresponding executable file without leading directories
(e.g., <samp><span class="file">ls.debug</span></samp> for <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/ls</span></samp>).  In addition, the
debug link specifies a 32-bit <dfn>Cyclic Redundancy Check</dfn> (CRC)
checksum for the debug file, which <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to validate that
the executable and the debug file came from the same build.

     <li>The executable contains a <dfn>build ID</dfn>, a unique bit string that is
also present in the corresponding debug info file.  (This is supported
only on some operating systems, when using the ELF or PE file formats
for binary files and the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Binutils.)  For more details about
this feature, see the description of the <samp><span class="option">--build-id</span></samp>
command-line option in <a href="ld.html#Options">Command Line Options</a>.  The debug info file's name is not specified
explicitly by the build ID, but can be computed from the build ID, see
below. 
</ul>

   <p>Depending on the way the debug info file is specified, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
uses two different methods of looking for the debug file:

     <ul>
<li>For the &ldquo;debug link&rdquo; method, <span class="sc">gdb</span> looks up the named file in
the directory of the executable file, then in a subdirectory of that
directory named <samp><span class="file">.debug</span></samp>, and finally under each one of the global debug
directories, in a subdirectory whose name is identical to the leading
directories of the executable's absolute file name.

     <li>For the &ldquo;build ID&rdquo; method, <span class="sc">gdb</span> looks in the
<samp><span class="file">.build-id</span></samp> subdirectory of each one of the global debug directories for
a file named <samp><var>nn</var><span class="file">/</span><var>nnnnnnnn</var><span class="file">.debug</span></samp>, where <var>nn</var> are the
first 2 hex characters of the build ID bit string, and <var>nnnnnnnn</var>
are the rest of the bit string.  (Real build ID strings are 32 or more
hex characters, not 10.) 
</ul>

   <p>So, for example, suppose you ask <span class="sc">gdb</span> to debug
<samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/ls</span></samp>, which has a debug link that specifies the
file <samp><span class="file">ls.debug</span></samp>, and a build ID whose value in hex is
<code>abcdef1234</code>.  If the list of the global debug directories includes
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/debug</span></samp>, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for the following
debug information files, in the indicated order:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/debug/.build-id/ab/cdef1234.debug</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/ls.debug</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/.debug/ls.debug</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug</span></samp>. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="debug_002dfile_002ddirectory"></a>Global debugging info directories default to what is set by <span class="sc">gdb</span>
configure option <samp><span class="option">--with-separate-debug-dir</span></samp>.  During <span class="sc">gdb</span> run
you can also set the global debugging info directories, and view the list
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is currently using.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002egnu_005fdebuglink_007d-sections-1215"></a><a name="index-debug-link-sections-1216"></a>A debug link is a special section of the executable file named
<code>.gnu_debuglink</code>.  The section must contain:

     <ul>
<li>A filename, with any leading directory components removed, followed by
a zero byte,
<li>zero to three bytes of padding, as needed to reach the next four-byte
boundary within the section, and
<li>a four-byte CRC checksum, stored in the same endianness used for the
executable file itself.  The checksum is computed on the debugging
information file's full contents by the function given below, passing
zero as the <var>crc</var> argument. 
</ul>

   <p>Any executable file format can carry a debug link, as long as it can
contain a section named <code>.gnu_debuglink</code> with the contents
described above.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002enote_002egnu_002ebuild_002did_007d-sections-1217"></a><a name="index-build-ID-sections-1218"></a>The build ID is a special section in the executable file (and in other
ELF binary files that <span class="sc">gdb</span> may consider).  This section is
often named <code>.note.gnu.build-id</code>, but that name is not mandatory. 
It contains unique identification for the built files&mdash;the ID remains
the same across multiple builds of the same build tree.  The default
algorithm SHA1 produces 160 bits (40 hexadecimal characters) of the
content for the build ID string.  The same section with an identical
value is present in the original built binary with symbols, in its
stripped variant, and in the separate debugging information file.

   <p>The debugging information file itself should be an ordinary
executable, containing a full set of linker symbols, sections, and
debugging information.  The sections of the debugging information file
should have the same names, addresses, and sizes as the original file,
but they need not contain any data&mdash;much like a <code>.bss</code> section
in an ordinary executable.

   <p>The <span class="sc">gnu</span> binary utilities (Binutils) package includes the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">objcopy</span></samp>&rsquo; utility that can produce
the separated executable / debugging information file pairs using the
following commands:

<pre class="smallexample">     <kbd>objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.debug</kbd>
     <kbd>strip -g foo</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These commands remove the debugging
information from the executable file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and place it in the file
<samp><span class="file">foo.debug</span></samp>.  You can use the first, second or both methods to link the
two files:

     <ul>
<li>The debug link method needs the following additional command to also leave
behind a debug link in <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          <kbd>objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.debug foo</kbd>
</pre>
     <p>Ulrich Drepper's <samp><span class="file">elfutils</span></samp> package, starting with version 0.53, contains
a version of the <code>strip</code> command such that the command <kbd>strip foo -f
foo.debug</kbd> has the same functionality as the two <code>objcopy</code> commands and
the <code>ln -s</code> command above, together.

     <li>Build ID gets embedded into the main executable using <code>ld --build-id</code> or
the <span class="sc">gcc</span> counterpart <code>gcc -Wl,--build-id</code>.  Build ID support plus
compatibility fixes for debug files separation are present in <span class="sc">gnu</span> binary
utilities (Binutils) package since version 2.18. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-CRC-algorithm-definition-1219"></a>The CRC used in <code>.gnu_debuglink</code> is the CRC-32 defined in
IEEE 802.3 using the polynomial:

<!-- TexInfo requires naked braces for multi-digit exponents for Tex -->
<!-- output, but this causes HTML output to barf. HTML has to be set using -->
<!-- raw commands. So we end up having to specify this equation in 2 -->
<!-- different ways! -->
<pre class="display">      <em>x</em><sup>32</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>26</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>23</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>22</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>16</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>12</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>11</sup>
      + <em>x</em><sup>10</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>8</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>7</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>5</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>4</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>x</em> + 1
</pre>
   <p>The function is computed byte at a time, taking the least
significant bit of each byte first.  The initial pattern
<code>0xffffffff</code> is used, to ensure leading zeros affect the CRC and
the final result is inverted to ensure trailing zeros also affect the
CRC.

   <p><em>Note:</em> This is the same CRC polynomial as used in handling the
<dfn>Remote Serial Protocol</dfn> <code>qCRC</code> packet (see <a href="#qCRC-packet">qCRC packet</a>). 
However in the case of the Remote Serial Protocol, the CRC is computed
<em>most</em> significant bit first, and the result is not inverted, so
trailing zeros have no effect on the CRC value.

   <p>To complete the description, we show below the code of the function
which produces the CRC used in <code>.gnu_debuglink</code>.  Inverting the
initially supplied <code>crc</code> argument means that an initial call to
this function passing in zero will start computing the CRC using
<code>0xffffffff</code>.

Some systems ship pre-built executables and libraries that have a
special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.gnu_debugdata</span></samp>&rsquo; section.  This feature is called
<dfn>MiniDebugInfo</dfn>.  This section holds an LZMA-compressed object and
is used to supply extra symbols for backtraces.

   <p>The intent of this section is to provide extra minimal debugging
information for use in simple backtraces.  It is not intended to be a
replacement for full separate debugging information (see <a href="#Separate-Debug-Files">Separate Debug Files</a>).  The example below shows the intended use; however,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> does not currently put restrictions on what sort of
debugging information might be included in the section.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> has support for this extension.  If the section exists,
then it is used provided that no other source of debugging information
can be found, and that <span class="sc">gdb</span> was configured with LZMA support.

   <p>This section can be easily created using <samp><span class="command">objcopy</span></samp> and other
standard utilities:

<pre class="smallexample">     # Extract the dynamic symbols from the main binary, there is no need
     # to also have these in the normal symbol table.
     nm -D <var>binary</var> --format=posix --defined-only \

     # Extract all the text (i.e. function) symbols from the debuginfo.
     # (Note that we actually also accept "D" symbols, for the benefit
     # of platforms like PowerPC64 that use function descriptors.)
     nm <var>binary</var> --format=posix --defined-only \
       | awk '{ if ($2 == "T" || $2 == "t" || $2 == "D") print $1 }' \
       | sort &gt; funcsyms
     
     # Keep all the function symbols not already in the dynamic symbol
     # table.
     comm -13 dynsyms funcsyms &gt; keep_symbols
     
     # Separate full debug info into debug binary.
     objcopy --only-keep-debug <var>binary</var> debug
     
     # Copy the full debuginfo, keeping only a minimal set of symbols and
     # removing some unnecessary sections.

<h3 class="section">18.4 Index Files Speed Up <span class="sc">gdb</span></h3>

<p><a name="index-index-files-1223"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002egdb_005findex_007d-section-1224"></a>
When <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the
file in order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most
<span class="sc">gdb</span> operations work quickly&mdash;at the cost of a delay early
on.  For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a way to build an index, which speeds up
startup.

   <p>The index is stored as a section in the symbol file.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> can
write the index to a file, then you can put it into the symbol file
using <samp><span class="command">objcopy</span></samp>.

   <p>To create an index file, use the <code>save gdb-index</code> command:

     <dl>
<dt><code>save gdb-index </code><var>directory</var><dd><a name="index-save-gdb_002dindex-1225"></a>Create an index file for each symbol file currently known by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Each file is named after its corresponding symbol file,
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.gdb-index</span></samp>&rsquo; appended, and is written into the given
<var>directory</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>Once you have created an index file you can merge it into your symbol
file, here named <samp><span class="file">symfile</span></samp>, using <samp><span class="command">objcopy</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ objcopy --add-section .gdb_index=symfile.gdb-index \
         --set-section-flags .gdb_index=readonly symfile symfile
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will normally ignore older versions of <samp><span class="file">.gdb_index</span></samp>
sections that have been deprecated.  Usually they are deprecated because
they are missing a new feature or have performance issues. 
To tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use a deprecated index section anyway
specify <code>set use-deprecated-index-sections on</code>. 
The default is <code>off</code>. 
This can speed up startup, but may result in some functionality being lost. 
See <a href="#Index-Section-Format">Index Section Format</a>.

   <p><em>Warning:</em> Setting <code>use-deprecated-index-sections</code> to <code>on</code>
must be done before gdb reads the file.  The following will not work:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb -ex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" &lt;program&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Instead you must do, for example,

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb -iex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" &lt;program&gt;
</pre>
   <p>There are currently some limitation on indices.  They only work when
for DWARF debugging information, not stabs.  And, they do not
currently work for programs using Ada.

<h3 class="section">18.5 Errors Reading Symbol Files</h3>

<p>While reading a symbol file, <span class="sc">gdb</span> occasionally encounters problems,
such as symbol types it does not recognize, or known bugs in compiler
output.  By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not notify you of such problems, since
they are relatively common and primarily of interest to people
debugging compilers.  If you are interested in seeing information
about ill-constructed symbol tables, you can either ask <span class="sc">gdb</span> to print
only one message about each such type of problem, no matter how many
times the problem occurs; or you can ask <span class="sc">gdb</span> to print more messages,
to see how many times the problems occur, with the <code>set
complaints</code> command (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and Messages</a>).

   <p>The messages currently printed, and their meanings, include:

     <dl>
<dt><code>inner block not inside outer block in </code><var>symbol</var><dd>
The symbol information shows where symbol scopes begin and end
(such as at the start of a function or a block of statements).  This
error indicates that an inner scope block is not fully contained
in its outer scope blocks.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> circumvents the problem by treating the inner block as if it had
the same scope as the outer block.  In the error message, <var>symbol</var>
may be shown as &ldquo;<code>(don't know)</code>&rdquo; if the outer block is not a
function.

     <br><dt><code>block at </code><var>address</var><code> out of order</code><dd>
The symbol information for symbol scope blocks should occur in
order of increasing addresses.  This error indicates that it does not
do so.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> does not circumvent this problem, and has trouble
locating symbols in the source file whose symbols it is reading.  (You
can often determine what source file is affected by specifying
<code>set verbose on</code>.  See <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and Messages</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>bad block start address patched</code><dd>
The symbol information for a symbol scope block has a start address
smaller than the address of the preceding source line.  This is known
to occur in the SunOS 4.1.1 (and earlier) C compiler.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> circumvents the problem by treating the symbol scope block as
starting on the previous source line.

     <br><dt><code>bad string table offset in symbol </code><var>n</var><dd>
<a name="index-foo-1226"></a>Symbol number <var>n</var> contains a pointer into the string table which is
larger than the size of the string table.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> circumvents the problem by considering the symbol to have the
name <code>foo</code>, which may cause other problems if many symbols end up
with this name.

     <br><dt><code>unknown symbol type 0x</code><var>nn</var><dd>
The symbol information contains new data types that <span class="sc">gdb</span> does
not yet know how to read.  <code>0x</code><var>nn</var> is the symbol type of the
uncomprehended information, in hexadecimal.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> circumvents the error by ignoring this symbol information. 
This usually allows you to debug your program, though certain symbols
are not accessible.  If you encounter such a problem and feel like
debugging it, you can debug <code>gdb</code> with itself, breakpoint
on <code>complain</code>, then go up to the function <code>read_dbx_symtab</code>
and examine <code>*bufp</code> to see the symbol.

     <br><dt><code>stub type has NULL name</code><dd>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> could not find the full definition for a struct or class.

     <br><dt><code>const/volatile indicator missing (ok if using g++ v1.x), got...</code><dd>The symbol information for a C<tt>++</tt> member function is missing some
information that recent versions of the compiler should have output for
it.

     <br><dt><code>info mismatch between compiler and debugger</code><dd>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> could not parse a type specification output by the compiler.

<h2 class="chapter">19 Specifying a Debugging Target</h2>

<p><a name="index-debugging-target-1232"></a>A <dfn>target</dfn> is the execution environment occupied by your program.

   <p>Often, <span class="sc">gdb</span> runs in the same host environment as your program;
in that case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when
you use the <code>file</code> or <code>core</code> commands.  When you need more
flexibility&mdash;for example, running <span class="sc">gdb</span> on a physically separate
host, or controlling a standalone system over a serial port or a
realtime system over a TCP/IP connection&mdash;you can use the <code>target</code>
command to specify one of the target types configured for <span class="sc">gdb</span>
(see <a href="#Target-Commands">Commands for Managing Targets</a>).

   <p><a name="index-target-architecture-1233"></a>It is possible to build <span class="sc">gdb</span> for several different <dfn>target
architectures</dfn>.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is built like that, you can choose
one of the available architectures with the <kbd>set architecture</kbd>
command.

<p><a name="index-stacking-targets-1238"></a><a name="index-active-targets-1239"></a><a name="index-multiple-targets-1240"></a>
There are multiple classes of targets such as: processes, executable files or
recording sessions.  Core files belong to the process class, making core file
and process mutually exclusive.  Otherwise, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can work concurrently
on multiple active targets, one in each class.  This allows you to (for
example) start a process and inspect its activity, while still having access to
the executable file after the process finishes.  Or if you start process
recording (see <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>) and <code>reverse-step</code> there, you are
presented a virtual layer of the recording target, while the process target
remains stopped at the chronologically last point of the process execution.

   <p>Use the <code>core-file</code> and <code>exec-file</code> commands to select a new core
file or executable target (see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).  To
specify as a target a process that is already running, use the <code>attach</code>
command (see <a href="#Attach">Debugging an Already-running Process</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><code>target </code><var>type</var> <var>parameters</var><dd>Connects the <span class="sc">gdb</span> host environment to a target machine or
process.  A target is typically a protocol for talking to debugging
facilities.  You use the argument <var>type</var> to specify the type or
protocol of the target machine.

     <p>Further <var>parameters</var> are interpreted by the target protocol, but
typically include things like device names or host names to connect
with, process numbers, and baud rates.

     <p>The <code>target</code> command does not repeat if you press &lt;RET&gt; again
after executing the command.

     <p><a name="index-help-target-1241"></a><br><dt><code>help target</code><dd>Displays the names of all targets available.  To display targets
currently selected, use either <code>info target</code> or <code>info files</code>
(see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

     <br><dt><code>help target </code><var>name</var><dd>Describe a particular target, including any parameters necessary to

with the <code>set gnutarget</code> command.  Unlike most <code>target</code> commands,
with <code>gnutarget</code> the <code>target</code> refers to a program, not a machine.

     <blockquote>

Some types of processors, such as the <acronym>MIPS</acronym>, PowerPC, and Renesas SH,
offer the ability to run either big-endian or little-endian byte
orders.  Usually the executable or symbol will include a bit to
designate the endian-ness, and you will not need to worry about
which to use.  However, you may still find it useful to adjust
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s idea of processor endian-ness manually.

<h2 class="chapter">20 Debugging Remote Programs</h2>

<p><a name="index-remote-debugging-1263"></a>
If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot run
<span class="sc">gdb</span> in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging. 
For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system kernel,
or on a small system which does not have a general purpose operating system
powerful enough to run a full-featured debugger.

   <p>Some configurations of <span class="sc">gdb</span> have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces
to make this work with particular debugging targets.  In addition,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
but not specific to any particular target system) which you can use if you
write the remote stubs&mdash;the code that runs on the remote system to
communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>Other remote targets may be available in your
configuration of <span class="sc">gdb</span>; use <code>help target</code> to list them.

<h3 class="section">20.1 Connecting to a Remote Target</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> needs an unstripped copy of your program to access symbol
and debugging information.  Some remote targets (see <a href="#qXfer-executable-filename-read">qXfer executable filename read</a>, and see <a href="#Host-I_002fO-Packets">Host I/O Packets</a>) allow
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to access program files over the same connection used to
communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  With such a target, if the remote
program is unstripped, the only command you need is <code>target
remote</code>.  Otherwise, start up <span class="sc">gdb</span> using the name of the local
unstripped copy of your program as the first argument, or use the
<code>file</code> command.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btarget-remote_007d-1264"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> can communicate with the target over a serial line, or
over an <acronym>IP</acronym> network using <acronym>TCP</acronym> or <acronym>UDP</acronym>.  In
each case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the same protocol for debugging your
program; only the medium carrying the debugging packets varies.  The
<code>target remote</code> command establishes a connection to the target. 
Its arguments indicate which medium to use:

     <dl>
<dt><code>target remote </code><var>serial-device</var><dd><a name="index-serial-line_002c-_0040code_007btarget-remote_007d-1265"></a>Use <var>serial-device</var> to communicate with the target.  For example,
to use a serial line connected to the device named <samp><span class="file">/dev/ttyb</span></samp>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          target remote /dev/ttyb
</pre>
     <p>If you're using a serial line, you may want to give <span class="sc">gdb</span> the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--baud</span></samp>&rsquo; option, or use the <code>set serial baud</code> command
(see <a href="#Remote-Configuration">set serial baud</a>) before the
<code>target</code> command.

     <br><dt><code>target remote </code><var>host</var><code>:</code><var>port</var><dt><code>target remote tcp:</code><var>host</var><code>:</code><var>port</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bTCP_007d-port_002c-_0040code_007btarget-remote_007d-1266"></a>Debug using a <acronym>TCP</acronym> connection to <var>port</var> on <var>host</var>. 
The <var>host</var> may be either a host name or a numeric <acronym>IP</acronym>
address; <var>port</var> must be a decimal number.  The <var>host</var> could be
the target machine itself, if it is directly connected to the net, or
it might be a terminal server which in turn has a serial line to the
target.

     <p>For example, to connect to port 2828 on a terminal server named
<code>manyfarms</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          target remote manyfarms:2828
</pre>
     <p>If your remote target is actually running on the same machine as your
debugger session (e.g. a simulator for your target running on the
same host), you can omit the hostname.  For example, to connect to
port 1234 on your local machine:

     <pre class="smallexample">          target remote :1234
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that the colon is still required here.

     <br><dt><code>target remote udp:</code><var>host</var><code>:</code><var>port</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bUDP_007d-port_002c-_0040code_007btarget-remote_007d-1267"></a>Debug using <acronym>UDP</acronym> packets to <var>port</var> on <var>host</var>.  For example, to

     <pre class="smallexample">          target remote udp:manyfarms:2828
</pre>
     <p>When using a <acronym>UDP</acronym> connection for remote debugging, you should
keep in mind that the `U' stands for &ldquo;Unreliable&rdquo;.  <acronym>UDP</acronym>
can silently drop packets on busy or unreliable networks, which will
cause havoc with your debugging session.

     <br><dt><code>target remote | </code><var>command</var><dd><a name="index-pipe_002c-_0040code_007btarget-remote_007d-to-1268"></a>Run <var>command</var> in the background and communicate with it using a
pipe.  The <var>command</var> is a shell command, to be parsed and expanded
by the system's command shell, <code>/bin/sh</code>; it should expect remote
protocol packets on its standard input, and send replies on its
standard output.  You could use this to run a stand-alone simulator
that speaks the remote debugging protocol, to make net connections
using programs like <code>ssh</code>, or for other similar tricks.

     <p>If <var>command</var> closes its standard output (perhaps by exiting),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will try to send it a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal.  (If the
program has already exited, this will have no effect.)

   </dl>

   <p>Once the connection has been established, you can use all the usual
commands to examine and change data.  The remote program is already
running; you can use <kbd>step</kbd> and <kbd>continue</kbd>, and you do not
need to use <kbd>run</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-interrupting-remote-programs-1269"></a><a name="index-remote-programs_002c-interrupting-1270"></a>Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> is waiting for the remote program, if you type the
interrupt character (often <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>), <span class="sc">gdb</span> attempts to stop the
program.  This may or may not succeed, depending in part on the hardware
and the serial drivers the remote system uses.  If you type the
interrupt character once again, <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays this prompt:

<pre class="smallexample">     Interrupted while waiting for the program.
     Give up (and stop debugging it)?  (y or n)
</pre>
   <p>If you type <kbd>y</kbd>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> abandons the remote debugging session. 
(If you decide you want to try again later, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target
remote</span></samp>&rsquo; again to connect once more.)  If you type <kbd>n</kbd>, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
goes back to waiting.

     
<a name="index-detach-_0028remote_0029-1271"></a>
<dl><dt><code>detach</code><dd>When you have finished debugging the remote program, you can use the
<code>detach</code> command to release it from <span class="sc">gdb</span> control. 
Detaching from the target normally resumes its execution, but the results

command, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is free to connect to another target.

     <p><a name="index-disconnect-1272"></a><br><dt><code>disconnect</code><dd>The <code>disconnect</code> command behaves like <code>detach</code>, except that

<h3 class="section">20.3 Using the <code>gdbserver</code> Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-gdbserver-1283"></a><a name="index-remote-connection-without-stubs-1284"></a><code>gdbserver</code> is a control program for Unix-like systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> via
<code>target remote</code>&mdash;but without linking in the usual debugging stub.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself does.  In fact, a system that can run
<code>gdbserver</code> to connect to a remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> could also run
<span class="sc">gdb</span> locally!  <code>gdbserver</code> is sometimes useful nevertheless,
because it is a much smaller program than <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself.  It is
also easier to port than all of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, so you may be able to get
started more quickly on a new system by using <code>gdbserver</code>. 
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use <code>gdbserver</code> to make a similar
choice for debugging.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> and <code>gdbserver</code> communicate via either a serial line
or a TCP connection, using the standard <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote serial
protocol.

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> <code>gdbserver</code> does not have any built-in security. 
Do not run <code>gdbserver</code> connected to any public network; a
<span class="sc">gdb</span> connection to <code>gdbserver</code> provides access to the
target system with the same privileges as the user running
<code>gdbserver</code>. 
</blockquote>

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.1 Running <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-arguments_002c-to-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1285"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d_002c-command_002dline-arguments-1286"></a>
Run <code>gdbserver</code> on the target system.  You need a copy of the
program you want to debug, including any libraries it requires. 
<code>gdbserver</code> does not need your program's symbol table, so you can
strip the program if necessary to save space.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host
system does all the symbol handling.

   <p>To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>;
the name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The usual
syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>program</var> [ <var>args</var> ... ]
</pre>
   <p><var>comm</var> is either a device name (to use a serial line), or a TCP
hostname and portnumber, or <code>-</code> or <code>stdio</code> to use
stdin/stdout of <code>gdbserver</code>. 
For example, to debug Emacs with the argument
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.txt</span></samp>&rsquo; and communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span> over the serial port
<samp><span class="file">/dev/com1</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p><code>gdbserver</code> waits passively for the host <span class="sc">gdb</span> to communicate
with it.

   <p>To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p>The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host <span class="sc">gdb</span> via
TCP.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host:2345</span></samp>&rsquo; argument means that <code>gdbserver</code> is to
expect a TCP connection from machine &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; to local TCP port 2345. 
(Currently, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; part is ignored.)  You can choose any number
you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any
TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, <code>23</code> is
reserved for <code>telnet</code>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a>  You must use the same port number with the host <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>target remote</code> command.

   <p>The <code>stdio</code> connection is useful when starting <code>gdbserver</code>
with ssh:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) target remote | ssh -T hostname gdbserver - hello
</pre>
   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>&rsquo; option to ssh is provided because we don't need a remote pty,
and we don't want escape-character handling.  Ssh does this by default when
a command is provided, the flag is provided to make it explicit. 
You could elide it if you want to.

   <p>Programs started with stdio-connected gdbserver have <samp><span class="file">/dev/null</span></samp> for
<code>stdin</code>, and <code>stdout</code>,<code>stderr</code> are sent back to gdb for
display through a pipe connected to gdbserver. 
Both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> use the same pipe.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.1 Attaching to a Running Program</h5>

<p><a name="index-attach-to-a-program_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1287"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dattach_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1288"></a>
On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> can also attach to running programs. 
This is accomplished via the <code>--attach</code> argument.  The syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre>
   <p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't necessary
to point <code>gdbserver</code> at a binary for the running process.

   <p><a name="index-pidof-1289"></a>You can debug processes by name instead of process ID if your target has the
<code>pidof</code> utility:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> `pidof <var>program</var>`
</pre>
   <p>In case more than one copy of <var>program</var> is running, or <var>program</var>
has multiple threads, most versions of <code>pidof</code> support the
<code>-s</code> option to only return the first process ID.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.2 Multi-Process Mode for <code>gdbserver</code></h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d_002c-multiple-processes-1290"></a><a name="index-multiple-processes-with-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1291"></a>
When you connect to <code>gdbserver</code> using <code>target remote</code>,
<code>gdbserver</code> debugs the specified program only once.  When the
program exits, or you detach from it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> closes the connection
and <code>gdbserver</code> exits.

   <p>If you connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>, <code>gdbserver</code>
enters multi-process mode.  When the debugged program exits, or you
detach from it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stays connected to <code>gdbserver</code> even
though no program is running.  The <code>run</code> and <code>attach</code>
commands instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to run or attach to a new program. 
The <code>run</code> command uses <code>set remote exec-file</code> (see <a href="#set-remote-exec_002dfile">set remote exec-file</a>) to select the program to run.  Command line
arguments are supported, except for wildcard expansion and I/O
redirection (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dmulti_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1292"></a>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use the <samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> command line option. 
Then you can connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> and start
the program you want to debug.

   <p>In multi-process mode <code>gdbserver</code> does not automatically exit unless you
use the option <samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp>.  You can terminate it by using
<code>monitor exit</code> (see <a href="#Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver">Monitor Commands for gdbserver</a>).  Note that the
conditions under which <code>gdbserver</code> terminates depend on how <span class="sc">gdb</span>
connects to it (<kbd>target remote</kbd> or <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>).  The
<samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> option to <code>gdbserver</code> has no influence on that.

<h5 class="subsubsection">20.3.1.3 TCP port allocation lifecycle of <code>gdbserver</code></h5>

<p>This section applies only when <code>gdbserver</code> is run to listen on a TCP port.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> normally terminates after all of its debugged processes have
terminated in <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.  On the other hand, for <kbd>target
extended-remote</kbd>, <code>gdbserver</code> stays running even with no processes left. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> normally terminates the spawned debugged process on its exit,
which normally also terminates <code>gdbserver</code> in the <kbd>target remote</kbd>
mode.  Therefore, when the connection drops unexpectedly, and <span class="sc">gdb</span>
cannot ask <code>gdbserver</code> to kill its debugged processes, <code>gdbserver</code>
stays running even in the <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.

   <p>When <code>gdbserver</code> stays running, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can connect to it again later. 
Such reconnecting is useful for features like <a href="#disconnected-tracing">disconnected tracing</a>.  For
completeness, at most one <span class="sc">gdb</span> can be connected at a time.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002donce_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1293"></a>By default, <code>gdbserver</code> keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
subsequent connections are possible.  However, if you start <code>gdbserver</code>
with the <samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp> option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first <span class="sc">gdb</span> session.  This
means no further connections to <code>gdbserver</code> will be possible after the
first one.  It also means <code>gdbserver</code> will terminate after the first
connection with remote <span class="sc">gdb</span> has closed, even for unexpectedly closed
connections and even in the <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> mode.  The
<samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp> option allows reusing the same port number for connecting to
multiple instances of <code>gdbserver</code> running on the same host, since each
instance closes its port after the first connection.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040option_007b_002d_002dwrapper_007d_002c-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-option-1297"></a>The <samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> option specifies a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
<kbd>--</kbd> indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.

   <p><code>gdbserver</code> runs the specified wrapper program with a combined
command line including the wrapper arguments, then the name of the
program to debug, then any arguments to the program.  The wrapper
runs until it executes your program, and then <span class="sc">gdb</span> gains control.

   <p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec "$@"</code> will also work.

   <p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in <code>gdbserver</code>'s
environment:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdbserver --wrapper env LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so -- :2222 ./testprog
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">20.3.2 Connecting to <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p>Run <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host system.

   <p>First make sure you have the necessary symbol files.  Load symbols for
your application using the <code>file</code> command before you connect.  Use
<code>set sysroot</code> to locate target libraries (unless your <span class="sc">gdb</span>
was compiled with the correct sysroot using <code>--with-sysroot</code>).

   <p>The symbol file and target libraries must exactly match the executable
and libraries on the target, with one exception: the files on the host
system should not be stripped, even if the files on the target system
are.  Mismatched or missing files will lead to confusing results
during debugging.  On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux targets, mismatched or missing
files may also prevent <code>gdbserver</code> from debugging multi-threaded
programs.

   <p>Connect to your target (see <a href="#Connecting">Connecting to a Remote Target</a>). 
For TCP connections, you must start up <code>gdbserver</code> prior to using
the <code>target remote</code> command.  Otherwise you may get an error whose
text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Connection refused</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Don't use the <code>load</code>
command in <span class="sc">gdb</span> when using <code>gdbserver</code>, since the program is
already on the target.

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.3 Monitor Commands for <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-monitor-commands_002c-for-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1298"></a><a name="Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver"></a>During a <span class="sc">gdb</span> session using <code>gdbserver</code>, you can use the

     <br><dt><code>monitor exit</code><dd>Tell gdbserver to exit immediately.  This command should be followed by
<code>disconnect</code> to close the debugging session.  <code>gdbserver</code> will
detach from any attached processes and kill any processes it created. 
Use <code>monitor exit</code> to terminate <code>gdbserver</code> at the end
of a multi-process mode debug session.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subsection">20.3.4 Tracepoints support in <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-tracepoints-support-in-_0040code_007bgdbserver_007d-1300"></a>
On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> supports tracepoints, fast
tracepoints and static tracepoints.

   <p>For fast or static tracepoints to work, a special library called the
<dfn>in-process agent</dfn> (IPA), must be loaded in the inferior process. 
This library is built and distributed as an integral part of
<code>gdbserver</code>.  In addition, support for static tracepoints
requires building the in-process agent library with static tracepoints
support.  At present, the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer,
<a href="http://lttng.org/ust">http://lttng.org/ust</a>) tracing engine is supported.  This support
is automatically available if UST development headers are found in the
standard include path when <code>gdbserver</code> is built, or if
<code>gdbserver</code> was explicitly configured using <samp><span class="option">--with-ust</span></samp>
to point at such headers.  You can explicitly disable the support
using <samp><span class="option">--with-ust=no</span></samp>.

   <p>There are several ways to load the in-process agent in your program:

     <dl>
<dt><code>Specifying it as dependency at link time</code><dd>
You can link your program dynamically with the in-process agent
library.  On most systems, this is accomplished by adding
<code>-linproctrace</code> to the link command.

     <br><dt><code>Using the system's preloading mechanisms</code><dd>
You can force loading the in-process agent at startup time by using
your system's support for preloading shared libraries.  Many Unixes
support the concept of preloading user defined libraries.  In most
cases, you do that by specifying <code>LD_PRELOAD=libinproctrace.so</code>
in the environment.  See also the description of <code>gdbserver</code>'s
<samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> command line option.

     <br><dt><code>Using </code><span class="sc">gdb</span><code> to force loading the agent at run time</code><dd>
On some systems, you can force the inferior to load a shared library,
by calling a dynamic loader function in the inferior that takes care
of dynamically looking up and loading a shared library.  On most Unix
systems, the function is <code>dlopen</code>.  You'll use the <code>call</code>
command for that.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) call dlopen ("libinproctrace.so", ...)
</pre>
     <p>Note that on most Unix systems, for the <code>dlopen</code> function to be
available, the program needs to be linked with <code>-ldl</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>On systems that have a userspace dynamic loader, like most Unix
systems, when you connect to <code>gdbserver</code> using <code>target
remote</code>, you'll find that the program is stopped at the dynamic
loader's entry point, and no shared library has been loaded in the
program's address space yet, including the in-process agent.  In that
case, before being able to use any of the fast or static tracepoints
features, you need to let the loader run and load the shared
libraries.  The simplest way to do that is to run the program to the
main procedure.  E.g., if debugging a C or C<tt>++</tt> program, start
<code>gdbserver</code> like so:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdbserver :9999 myprogram
</pre>
   <p>Start GDB and connect to <code>gdbserver</code> like so, and run to main:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb myprogram
     (gdb) target remote myhost:9999
     0x00007f215893ba60 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     (gdb) b main
     (gdb) continue
</pre>
   <p>The in-process tracing agent library should now be loaded into the
process; you can confirm it with the <code>info sharedlibrary</code>
command, which will list <samp><span class="file">libinproctrace.so</span></samp> as loaded in the
process.  You are now ready to install fast tracepoints, list static
tracepoint markers, probe static tracepoints markers, and start
tracing.

   <p><a name="index-remote-packets_002c-enabling-and-disabling-1326"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote protocol autodetects the packets supported by
your debugging stub.  If you need to override the autodetection, you
can use these commands to enable or disable individual packets.  Each
packet can be set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; (the remote target supports this
packet), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo; (the remote target does not support this packet),
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo; (detect remote target support for this packet).  They
all default to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For more information about each packet,
see <a href="#Remote-Protocol">Remote Protocol</a>.

   <p>During normal use, you should not have to use any of these commands. 
If you do, that may be a bug in your remote debugging stub, or a bug
in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  You may want to report the problem to the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> developers.

   <p>For each packet <var>name</var>, the command to enable or disable the

<h3 class="section">20.5 Implementing a Remote Stub</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-stub_002c-example-1327"></a><a name="index-remote-stub_002c-example-1328"></a><a name="index-stub-example_002c-remote-debugging-1329"></a>The stub files provided with <span class="sc">gdb</span> implement the target side of the
communication protocol, and the <span class="sc">gdb</span> side is implemented in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> source file <samp><span class="file">remote.c</span></samp>.  Normally, you can simply allow
these subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details.  (If you're
implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start
with one of the existing stub files.  <samp><span class="file">sparc-stub.c</span></samp> is the best
organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)

   <p><a name="index-remote-serial-debugging_002c-overview-1330"></a>To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging
<dfn>target</dfn> machine), you must first arrange for all the usual
prerequisites for the program to run by itself.  For example, for a C
program, you need:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these usually
have a name like <samp><span class="file">crt0</span></samp>.  The startup routine may be supplied by
your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your own.

     <li>A C subroutine library to support your program's
subroutine calls, notably managing input and output.

     <li>A way of getting your program to the other machine&mdash;for example, a
download program.  These are often supplied by the hardware
manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware
documentation.
        </ol>

   <p>The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to
communicate with the machine where <span class="sc">gdb</span> is running (the <dfn>host</dfn>
machine).  In general terms, the scheme looks like this:

     <dl>
<dt><em>On the host,</em><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> already understands how to use this protocol; when everything
else is set up, you can simply use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target remote</span></samp>&rsquo; command
(see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).

     <br><dt><em>On the target,</em><dd>you must link with your program a few special-purpose subroutines that
implement the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote serial protocol.  The file containing these
subroutines is called  a <dfn>debugging stub</dfn>.

     <p>On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program
<code>gdbserver</code> instead of linking a stub into your program. 
See <a href="#Server">Using the <code>gdbserver</code> Program</a>, for details. 
</dl>

   <p>The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote
machine; for example, use <samp><span class="file">sparc-stub.c</span></samp> to debug programs on
<span class="sc">sparc</span> boards.

<h4 class="subsection">20.5.1 What the Stub Can Do for You</h4>

<p><a name="index-remote-serial-stub-1346"></a>The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three
subroutines:

     <dl>
<dt><code>set_debug_traps</code><dd><a name="index-set_005fdebug_005ftraps-1347"></a><a name="index-remote-serial-stub_002c-initialization-1348"></a>This routine arranges for <code>handle_exception</code> to run when your
program stops.  You must call this subroutine explicitly in your
program's startup code.

     <br><dt><code>handle_exception</code><dd><a name="index-handle_005fexception-1349"></a><a name="index-remote-serial-stub_002c-main-routine-1350"></a>This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it
explicitly&mdash;the setup code arranges for <code>handle_exception</code> to
run when a trap is triggered.

     <p><code>handle_exception</code> takes control when your program stops during
execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications
with <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host machine.  This is where the communications
protocol is implemented; <code>handle_exception</code> acts as the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
representative on the target machine.  It begins by sending summary
information on the state of your program, then continues to execute,
retrieving and transmitting any information <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs, until you
execute a <span class="sc">gdb</span> command that makes your program resume; at that point,
<code>handle_exception</code> returns control to your own code on the target
machine.

     <br><dt><code>breakpoint</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bbreakpoint_007d-subroutine_002c-remote-1351"></a>Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a
breakpoint.  Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only
way for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to get control.  For instance, if your target
machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won't need to call this;
pressing the interrupt button transfers control to
<code>handle_exception</code>&mdash;in effect, to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  On some machines,
simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap;
again, in that situation, you don't need to call <code>breakpoint</code> from
your own program&mdash;simply running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target remote</span></samp>&rsquo; from the host
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session gets control.

     <p>Call <code>breakpoint</code> if none of these is true, or if you simply want
to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the
start of your debugging session.

<h4 class="subsection">20.5.2 What You Must Do for the Stub</h4>

<p><a name="index-remote-stub_002c-support-routines-1352"></a>The debugging stubs that come with <span class="sc">gdb</span> are set up for a particular
chip architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your
debugging target machine.

   <p>First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the
serial port.

     <dl>
<dt><code>int getDebugChar()</code><dd><a name="index-getDebugChar-1353"></a>Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial port. 
It may be identical to <code>getchar</code> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.

     <br><dt><code>void putDebugChar(int)</code><dd><a name="index-putDebugChar-1354"></a>Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial port. 
It may be identical to <code>putchar</code> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-control-C_002c-and-remote-debugging-1355"></a><a name="index-interrupting-remote-targets-1356"></a>If you want <span class="sc">gdb</span> to be able to stop your program while it is
running, you need to use an interrupt-driven serial driver, and arrange
for it to stop when it receives a <code>^C</code> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\003</span></samp>&rsquo;, the control-C
character).  That is the character which <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to tell the
remote system to stop.

   <p>Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to <span class="sc">gdb</span>
probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way
is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; part is that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> reports a <code>SIGTRAP</code> instead of a <code>SIGINT</code>).

   <p>Other routines you need to supply are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>void exceptionHandler (int </code><var>exception_number</var><code>, void *</code><var>exception_address</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-exceptionHandler-1357"></a>Write this function to install <var>exception_address</var> in the exception
handling tables.  You need to do this because the stub does not have any
way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your target system
are like (for example, the processor's table might be in <span class="sc">rom</span>,
containing entries which point to a table in <span class="sc">ram</span>). 
The <var>exception_number</var> specifies the exception which should be changed;
its meaning is architecture-dependent (for example, different numbers
might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc).  When this
exception occurs, control should be transferred directly to
<var>exception_address</var>, and the processor state (stack, registers,
and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception occurs.  So if
you want to use a jump instruction to reach <var>exception_address</var>, it
should be a simple jump, not a jump to subroutine.

     <p>For the 386, <var>exception_address</var> should be installed as an interrupt
gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs.  The gate
should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level).  The
<span class="sc">sparc</span> and 68k stubs are able to mask interrupts themselves without
help from <code>exceptionHandler</code>.

     <p>On target machines that have instruction caches, <span class="sc">gdb</span> requires this

<h4 class="subsection">20.5.3 Putting it All Together</h4>

<p><a name="index-remote-serial-debugging-summary-1360"></a>In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these
steps.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Make sure you have defined the supporting low-level routines
(see <a href="#Bootstrapping">What You Must Do for the Stub</a>):
     <pre class="display">          <code>getDebugChar</code>, <code>putDebugChar</code>,
          <code>flush_i_cache</code>, <code>memset</code>, <code>exceptionHandler</code>.
</pre>
     <li>Insert these lines in your program's startup code, before the main
procedure is called:

     <pre class="smallexample">          set_debug_traps();
          breakpoint();
</pre>
     <p>On some machines, when a breakpoint trap is raised, the hardware
automatically makes the PC point to the instruction after the
breakpoint.  If your machine doesn't do that, you may need to adjust
<code>handle_exception</code> to arrange for it to return to the instruction
after the breakpoint on this first invocation, so that your program
doesn't keep hitting the initial breakpoint instead of making
progress.

     <li>For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called
<code>exceptionHook</code>.  Normally you just use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">but if before calling <code>set_debug_traps</code>, you set it to point to a
function in your program, that function is called when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus
error).  The function indicated by <code>exceptionHook</code> is called with
one parameter: an <code>int</code> which is the exception number.

     <li>Compile and link together: your program, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> debugging stub for
your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.

     <li>Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine and
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> host, and identify the serial port on the host.

     <li><!-- The "remote" target now provides a `load' command, so we should -->
<!-- document that.  FIXME. -->
Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by
whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.

     <li>Start <span class="sc">gdb</span> on the host, and connect to the target
(see <a href="#Connecting">Connecting to a Remote Target</a>).

<p>While nearly all <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands are available for all native and
cross versions of the debugger, there are some exceptions.  This chapter
describes things that are only available in certain configurations.

   <p>There are three major categories of configurations: native
configurations, where the host and target are the same, embedded
operating system configurations, which are usually the same for several
different processor architectures, and bare embedded processors, which
are quite different from each other.

<p><a name="index-libkvm-1361"></a><a name="index-kernel-memory-image-1362"></a><a name="index-kernel-crash-dump-1363"></a>
BSD-derived systems (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD) have a kernel memory
interface that provides a uniform interface for accessing kernel virtual
memory images, including live systems and crash dumps.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
uses this interface to allow you to debug live kernels and kernel crash
dumps on many native BSD configurations.  This is implemented as a
special <code>kvm</code> debugging target.  For debugging a live system, load
the currently running kernel into <span class="sc">gdb</span> and connect to the
<code>kvm</code> target:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>target kvm</b>
</pre>
   <p>For debugging crash dumps, provide the file name of the crash dump as an
argument:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>target kvm /var/crash/bsd.0</b>
</pre>
   <p>Once connected to the <code>kvm</code> target, the following commands are
available:

     
<a name="index-kvm-1364"></a>
<dl><dt><code>kvm pcb</code><dd>Set current context from the <dfn>Process Control Block</dfn> (PCB) address.

     <br><dt><code>kvm proc</code><dd>Set current context from proc address.  This command isn't available on

Many versions of SVR4 and compatible systems provide a facility called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/proc</span></samp>&rsquo; that can be used to examine the image of a running
process using file-system subroutines.

   <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is configured for an operating system with this
facility, the command <code>info proc</code> is available to report
information about the process running your program, or about any
process running on your system.  This includes, as of this writing,
<span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and Solaris, but not HP-UX, for example.

   <p>This command may also work on core files that were created on a system

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bdjgpp_007d-debugging-1388"></a><a name="index-native-_0040sc_007bdjgpp_007d-debugging-1389"></a><a name="index-MS_002dDOS_002dspecific-commands-1390"></a>
<a name="index-DPMI-1391"></a><span class="sc">djgpp</span> is a port of the <span class="sc">gnu</span> development tools to MS-DOS and
MS-Windows.  <span class="sc">djgpp</span> programs are 32-bit protected-mode programs
that use the <dfn>DPMI</dfn> (DOS Protected-Mode Interface) API to run on
top of real-mode DOS systems and their emulations.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports native debugging of <span class="sc">djgpp</span> programs, and
defines a few commands specific to the <span class="sc">djgpp</span> port.  This
subsection describes those commands.

     
<a name="index-info-dos-1392"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info dos</code><dd>This is a prefix of <span class="sc">djgpp</span>-specific commands which print
information about the target system and important OS structures.

     <p><a name="index-sysinfo-1393"></a><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-system-info-1394"></a><a name="index-free-memory-information-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1395"></a><br><dt><code>info dos sysinfo</code><dd>This command displays assorted information about the underlying
platform: the CPU type and features, the OS version and flavor, the
DPMI version, and the available conventional and DPMI memory.

     <p><a name="index-GDT-1396"></a><a name="index-LDT-1397"></a><a name="index-IDT-1398"></a><a name="index-segment-descriptor-tables-1399"></a><a name="index-descriptor-tables-display-1400"></a><br><dt><code>info dos gdt</code><dt><code>info dos ldt</code><dt><code>info dos idt</code><dd>These 3 commands display entries from, respectively, Global, Local,
and Interrupt Descriptor Tables (GDT, LDT, and IDT).  The descriptor
tables are data structures which store a descriptor for each segment
that is currently in use.  The segment's selector is an index into a
descriptor table; the table entry for that index holds the
descriptor's base address and limit, and its attributes and access
rights.

     <p>A typical <span class="sc">djgpp</span> program uses 3 segments: a code segment, a data
segment (used for both data and the stack), and a DOS segment (which
allows access to DOS/BIOS data structures and absolute addresses in
conventional memory).  However, the DPMI host will usually define
additional segments in order to support the DPMI environment.

     <p><a name="index-garbled-pointers-1401"></a>These commands allow to display entries from the descriptor tables. 
Without an argument, all entries from the specified table are
displayed.  An argument, which should be an integer expression, means
display a single entry whose index is given by the argument.  For
example, here's a convenient way to display information about the
debugged program's data segment:

     <pre class="smallexample">     <br><code>(gdb) info dos ldt $ds</code><br>
     <br><code>0x13f: base=0x11970000 limit=0x0009ffff 32-Bit Data (Read/Write, Exp-up)</code><br>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This comes in handy when you want to see whether a pointer is outside
the data segment's limit (i.e. <dfn>garbled</dfn>).

     <p><a name="index-page-tables-display-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029-1402"></a><br><dt><code>info dos pde</code><dt><code>info dos pte</code><dd>These two commands display entries from, respectively, the Page
Directory and the Page Tables.  Page Directories and Page Tables are
data structures which control how virtual memory addresses are mapped
into physical addresses.  A Page Table includes an entry for every
page of memory that is mapped into the program's address space; there
may be several Page Tables, each one holding up to 4096 entries.  A
Page Directory has up to 4096 entries, one each for every Page Table
that is currently in use.

     <p>Without an argument, <kbd>info dos pde</kbd> displays the entire Page
Directory, and <kbd>info dos pte</kbd> displays all the entries in all of
the Page Tables.  An argument, an integer expression, given to the
<kbd>info dos pde</kbd> command means display only that entry from the Page
Directory table.  An argument given to the <kbd>info dos pte</kbd> command
means display entries from a single Page Table, the one pointed to by
the specified entry in the Page Directory.

     <p><a name="index-direct-memory-access-_0028DMA_0029-on-MS_002dDOS-1403"></a>These commands are useful when your program uses <dfn>DMA</dfn> (Direct
Memory Access), which needs physical addresses to program the DMA
controller.

     <p>These commands are supported only with some DPMI servers.

     <p><a name="index-physical-address-from-linear-address-1404"></a><br><dt><code>info dos address-pte </code><var>addr</var><dd>This command displays the Page Table entry for a specified linear
address.  The argument <var>addr</var> is a linear address which should
already have the appropriate segment's base address added to it,
because this command accepts addresses which may belong to <em>any</em>
segment.  For example, here's how to display the Page Table entry for
the page where a variable <code>i</code> is stored:

     <pre class="smallexample">     <br><code>(gdb) info dos address-pte __djgpp_base_address + (char *)&amp;i</code><br>
     <br><code>Page Table entry for address 0x11a00d30:</code><br>
     <br><code>Base=0x02698000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0xd30</code><br>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This says that <code>i</code> is stored at offset <code>0xd30</code> from the page
whose physical base address is <code>0x02698000</code>, and shows all the
attributes of that page.

     <p>Note that you must cast the addresses of variables to a <code>char *</code>,
since otherwise the value of <code>__djgpp_base_address</code>, the base
address of all variables and functions in a <span class="sc">djgpp</span> program, will
be added using the rules of C pointer arithmetics: if <code>i</code> is
declared an <code>int</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will add 4 times the value of
<code>__djgpp_base_address</code> to the address of <code>i</code>.

     <p>Here's another example, it displays the Page Table entry for the
transfer buffer:

     <pre class="smallexample">     <br><code>(gdb) info dos address-pte *((unsigned *)&amp;_go32_info_block + 3)</code><br>
     <br><code>Page Table entry for address 0x29110:</code><br>
     <br><code>Base=0x00029000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0x110</code><br>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">(The <code>+ 3</code> offset is because the transfer buffer's address is the
3rd member of the <code>_go32_info_block</code> structure.)  The output
clearly shows that this DPMI server maps the addresses in conventional
memory 1:1, i.e. the physical (<code>0x00029000</code> + <code>0x110</code>) and
linear (<code>0x29110</code>) addresses are identical.

     <p>This command is supported only with some DPMI servers.

   <p><a name="index-DOS-serial-data-link_002c-remote-debugging-1405"></a>In addition to native debugging, the DJGPP port supports remote
debugging via a serial data link.  The following commands are specific

<span class="sc">gdb</span> supports native debugging of MS Windows programs, including
DLLs with and without symbolic debugging information.

   <p><a name="index-Ctrl_002dBREAK_002c-MS_002dWindows-1427"></a><a name="index-interrupt-debuggee-on-MS_002dWindows-1428"></a>MS-Windows programs that call <code>SetConsoleMode</code> to switch off the
special meaning of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-C</span></samp>&rsquo; keystroke cannot be interrupted
by typing <kbd>C-c</kbd>.  For this reason, <span class="sc">gdb</span> on MS-Windows
supports <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> as an alternative interrupt key
sequence, which can be used to interrupt the debuggee even if it
ignores <kbd>C-c</kbd>.

   <p>There are various additional Cygwin-specific commands, described in
this section.  Working with DLLs that have no debugging symbols is
described in <a href="#Non_002ddebug-DLL-Symbols">Non-debug DLL Symbols</a>.

<dl><dt><code>info w32</code><dd>This is a prefix of MS Windows-specific commands which print
information about the target system and important OS structures.

     <br><dt><code>info w32 selector</code><dd>This command displays information returned by
the Win32 API <code>GetThreadSelectorEntry</code> function. 
It takes an optional argument that is evaluated to
a long value to give the information about this given selector. 
Without argument, this command displays information
about the six segment registers.

     <br><dt><code>info w32 thread-information-block</code><dd>This command displays thread specific information stored in the
Thread Information Block (readable on the X86 CPU family using <code>$fs</code>

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.1.5.1 Support for DLLs without Debugging Symbols</h5>

<p><a name="index-DLLs-with-no-debugging-symbols-1444"></a><a name="index-Minimal-symbols-and-DLLs-1445"></a>
Very often on windows, some of the DLLs that your program relies on do
not include symbolic debugging information (for example,
<samp><span class="file">kernel32.dll</span></samp>).  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> doesn't recognize any debugging
symbols in a DLL, it relies on the minimal amount of symbolic
information contained in the DLL's export table.  This section
describes working with such symbols, known internally to <span class="sc">gdb</span> as
&ldquo;minimal symbols&rdquo;.

   <p>Note that before the debugged program has started execution, no DLLs
will have been loaded.  The easiest way around this problem is simply to
start the program &mdash; either by setting a breakpoint or letting the
program run once to completion.

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.1.5.2 DLL Name Prefixes</h5>

<p>In keeping with the naming conventions used by the Microsoft debugging
tools, DLL export symbols are made available with a prefix based on the
DLL name, for instance <code>KERNEL32!CreateFileA</code>.  The plain name is
also entered into the symbol table, so <code>CreateFileA</code> is often
sufficient.  In some cases there will be name clashes within a program
(particularly if the executable itself includes full debugging symbols)
necessitating the use of the fully qualified name when referring to the
contents of the DLL.  Use single-quotes around the name to avoid the
exclamation mark (&ldquo;!&rdquo;)  being interpreted as a language operator.

   <p>Note that the internal name of the DLL may be all upper-case, even
though the file name of the DLL is lower-case, or vice-versa.  Since
symbols within <span class="sc">gdb</span> are <em>case-sensitive</em> this may cause
some confusion. If in doubt, try the <code>info functions</code> and
<code>info variables</code> commands or even <code>maint print msymbols</code>
(see <a href="#Symbols">Symbols</a>). Here's an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info function CreateFileA
     All functions matching regular expression "CreateFileA":
     
     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x77e885f4  CreateFileA
     0x77e885f4  KERNEL32!CreateFileA
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info function !
     All functions matching regular expression "!":
     
     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x6100114c  cygwin1!__assert
     0x61004034  cygwin1!_dll_crt0@0
     0x61004240  cygwin1!dll_crt0(per_process *)
     [etc...]
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">21.1.5.3 Working with Minimal Symbols</h5>

<p>Symbols extracted from a DLL's export table do not contain very much
type information. All that <span class="sc">gdb</span> can do is guess whether a symbol
refers to a function or variable depending on the linker section that
contains the symbol. Also note that the actual contents of the memory
contained in a DLL are not available unless the program is running. This
means that you cannot examine the contents of a variable or disassemble
a function within a DLL without a running program.

   <p>Variables are generally treated as pointers and dereferenced
automatically. For this reason, it is often necessary to prefix a
variable name with the address-of operator (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) and provide explicit
type information in the command. Here's an example of the type of
problem:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print 'cygwin1!__argv'
     $1 = 268572168
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x 'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x10021610:      "\230y\""
</pre>
   <p>And two possible solutions:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print ((char **)'cygwin1!__argv')[0]
     $2 = 0x22fd98 "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) x/2x &amp;'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x610c0aa8 &lt;cygwin1!__argv&gt;:    0x10021608      0x00000000
     (gdb) x/x 0x10021608
     0x10021608:     0x0022fd98
     (gdb) x/s 0x0022fd98
     0x22fd98:        "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"
</pre>
   <p>Setting a break point within a DLL is possible even before the program
starts execution. However, under these circumstances, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can't
examine the initial instructions of the function in order to skip the
function's frame set-up code. You can work around this by using &ldquo;*&amp;&rdquo;
to set the breakpoint at a raw memory address:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) break *&amp;'python22!PyOS_Readline'
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x1e04eff0
</pre>
   <p>The author of these extensions is not entirely convinced that setting a
break point within a shared DLL like <samp><span class="file">kernel32.dll</span></samp> is completely
safe.

<h4 class="subsection">21.1.6 Commands Specific to <span class="sc">gnu</span> Hurd Systems</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-debugging-1446"></a>
This subsection describes <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands specific to the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Hurd native debugging.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set signals</code><dt><code>set sigs</code><dd><a name="index-set-signals_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1447"></a><a name="index-set-sigs_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1448"></a>This command toggles the state of inferior signal interception by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Mach exceptions, such as breakpoint traps, are not
affected by this command.  <code>sigs</code> is a shorthand alias for
<code>signals</code>.

     <br><dt><code>show signals</code><dt><code>show sigs</code><dd><a name="index-show-signals_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1449"></a><a name="index-show-sigs_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1450"></a>Show the current state of intercepting inferior's signals.

     <br><dt><code>set signal-thread</code><dt><code>set sigthread</code><dd><a name="index-set-signal_002dthread-1451"></a><a name="index-set-sigthread-1452"></a>This command tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> which thread is the <code>libc</code> signal
thread.  That thread is run when a signal is delivered to a running
process.  <code>set sigthread</code> is the shorthand alias of <code>set
signal-thread</code>.

     <br><dt><code>show signal-thread</code><dt><code>show sigthread</code><dd><a name="index-show-signal_002dthread-1453"></a><a name="index-show-sigthread-1454"></a>These two commands show which thread will run when the inferior is
delivered a signal.

     <br><dt><code>set stopped</code><dd><a name="index-set-stopped_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1455"></a>This commands tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> that the inferior process is stopped,
as with the <code>SIGSTOP</code> signal.  The stopped process can be
continued by delivering a signal to it.

     <br><dt><code>show stopped</code><dd><a name="index-show-stopped_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1456"></a>This command shows whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> thinks the debuggee is
stopped.

     <br><dt><code>set exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-set-exceptions_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1457"></a>Use this command to turn off trapping of exceptions in the inferior. 
When exception trapping is off, neither breakpoints nor
single-stepping will work.  To restore the default, set exception
trapping on.

     <br><dt><code>show exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-show-exceptions_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1458"></a>Show the current state of trapping exceptions in the inferior.

     <br><dt><code>set task pause</code><dd><a name="index-set-task_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-commands_007d-1459"></a><a name="index-task-attributes-_0028_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd_0029-1460"></a><a name="index-pause-current-task-_0028_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd_0029-1461"></a>This command toggles task suspension when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has control. 
Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the task is suspended
whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> gets control.  Setting it to off will take
effect the next time the inferior is continued.  If this option is set
to off, you can use <code>set thread default pause on</code> or <code>set
thread pause on</code> (see below) to pause individual threads.

     <br><dt><code>show task pause</code><dd><a name="index-show-task_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-commands_007d-1462"></a>Show the current state of task suspension.

     <br><dt><code>set task detach-suspend-count</code><dd><a name="index-task-suspend-count-1463"></a><a name="index-detach-from-task_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1464"></a>This command sets the suspend count the task will be left with when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> detaches from it.

     <br><dt><code>show task detach-suspend-count</code><dd>Show the suspend count the task will be left with when detaching.

     <br><dt><code>set task exception-port</code><dt><code>set task excp</code><dd><a name="index-task-exception-port_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1465"></a>This command sets the task exception port to which <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
forward exceptions.  The argument should be the value of the <dfn>send
rights</dfn> of the task.  <code>set task excp</code> is a shorthand alias.

     <br><dt><code>set noninvasive</code><dd><a name="index-noninvasive-task-options-1466"></a>This command switches <span class="sc">gdb</span> to a mode that is the least
invasive as far as interfering with the inferior is concerned.  This
is the same as using <code>set task pause</code>, <code>set exceptions</code>, and
<code>set signals</code> to values opposite to the defaults.

     <br><dt><code>info send-rights</code><dt><code>info receive-rights</code><dt><code>info port-rights</code><dt><code>info port-sets</code><dt><code>info dead-names</code><dt><code>info ports</code><dt><code>info psets</code><dd><a name="index-send-rights_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1467"></a><a name="index-receive-rights_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1468"></a><a name="index-port-rights_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1469"></a><a name="index-port-sets_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1470"></a><a name="index-dead-names_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1471"></a>These commands display information about, respectively, send rights,
receive rights, port rights, port sets, and dead names of a task. 
There are also shorthand aliases: <code>info ports</code> for <code>info
port-rights</code> and <code>info psets</code> for <code>info port-sets</code>.

     <br><dt><code>set thread pause</code><dd><a name="index-set-thread_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1472"></a><a name="index-thread-properties_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1473"></a><a name="index-pause-current-thread-_0028_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd_0029-1474"></a>This command toggles current thread suspension when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
control.  Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the current
thread is suspended whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> gets control.  Setting it to
off will take effect the next time the inferior is continued. 
Normally, this command has no effect, since when <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
control, the whole task is suspended.  However, if you used <code>set
task pause off</code> (see above), this command comes in handy to suspend
only the current thread.

     <br><dt><code>show thread pause</code><dd><a name="index-show-thread_0040r_007b_002c-Hurd-command_007d-1475"></a>This command shows the state of current thread suspension.

     <br><dt><code>set thread run</code><dd>This command sets whether the current thread is allowed to run.

     <br><dt><code>show thread run</code><dd>Show whether the current thread is allowed to run.

     <br><dt><code>set thread detach-suspend-count</code><dd><a name="index-thread-suspend-count_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1476"></a><a name="index-detach-from-thread_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1477"></a>This command sets the suspend count <span class="sc">gdb</span> will leave on a
thread when detaching.  This number is relative to the suspend count
found by <span class="sc">gdb</span> when it notices the thread; use <code>set thread
takeover-suspend-count</code> to force it to an absolute value.

     <br><dt><code>show thread detach-suspend-count</code><dd>Show the suspend count <span class="sc">gdb</span> will leave on the thread when
detaching.

     <br><dt><code>set thread exception-port</code><dt><code>set thread excp</code><dd>Set the thread exception port to which to forward exceptions.  This
overrides the port set by <code>set task exception-port</code> (see above). 
<code>set thread excp</code> is the shorthand alias.

     <br><dt><code>set thread takeover-suspend-count</code><dd>Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s thread suspend counts are relative to the
value <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds when it notices each thread.  This command
changes the suspend counts to be absolute instead.

     <br><dt><code>set thread default</code><dt><code>show thread default</code><dd><a name="index-thread-default-settings_002c-_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Hurd-1478"></a>Each of the above <code>set thread</code> commands has a <code>set thread
default</code> counterpart (e.g., <code>set thread default pause</code>, <code>set
thread default exception-port</code>, etc.).  The <code>thread default</code>
variety of commands sets the default thread properties for all
threads; you can then change the properties of individual threads with
the non-default commands.

<h4 class="subsection">21.2.1 Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> with VxWorks</h4>

<p><a name="index-VxWorks-1486"></a>
Debugging on VxWorks is supported on VxWorks 5.5, all versions of
Vworks 6 starting with version 6.4, and VxWorks 653.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
does not connect directly to the target running VxWorks, but instead
relies on the <dfn>Target Server</dfn>, which is a process running on the
host.  The debugger establishes a connection with that process, and
sends all debugging comands (resume task execution, read memory, read
register, <small class="dots">...</small>) through the Target Server.

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.1 Debugging on VxWorks 5.5</h5>

<p>Debugging a program on VxWorks 5.5 is performed by connecting to
the Target Server first.  To establish this connection, use the
<code>target wtx</code> command (<dfn>WTX</dfn> is the name of the protocol
used to communicate with the Target Server):

     
<a name="index-target-wtx-1487"></a>
<dl><dt><code>target wtx </code><var>target-server-name</var><dd>Connect <span class="sc">gdb</span> to a Target Server whose name is
<var>target-server-name</var>.  Once the connection is established,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> queries the list of modules loaded on the target, and
then proceeds to load the symbol table and debugging information
from these modules. 
</dl>

   <p>VxWorks does not have a concept of processes, or even programs, like
most Operating Systems do.  Instead of running a program, one spawns
a <dfn>task</dfn> (a.k.a. a thread), usually using a symbol name as the entry
point for that thread.  Every task created can be regarded as a kernel
thread, since it shares memory and code with the rest of the system.

   <p>To create a new task under debugger control, use the <code>run</code>
command, passing as the first parameter the name of the symbol
to use as the entry point (all other parameters are ignored):

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) run simple_main

   <p>Instead of creating a new task, it is also possible to attach the
debugger to an already existing task, using the <code>attach</code> command. 
The equivalent of the Unix process ID is the task ID on VxWorks, and
these IDs should be used to identify the task that needs to be
debugged.

</pre>
   <p>As a convenience, GDB allows the use of the task name as a parameter
to the <code>attach</code> command, in place of the task ID.  When a task
name is specified, the first task whose name matches is selected. 
If there are more than one tasks with the same name, the selection
process is random.

   <p>A list of all tasks currently running on the target can be obtained
using the <code>info wtx threads</code> command.

     
<a name="index-info-wtx-threads-1488"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info wtx threads</code><dd>Print the list of threads currently running on the target. 
Each line represents a thread, and contains 2 space-separated
elements.  The first element is the task ID, and the second
is the task name.

   <p>GDB offers several modes for debugging VxWorks tasks:

     
<a name="index-VxWorks_002c-Task-Mode-Debugging-1489"></a>
<dl><dt><dfn>Task Mode</dfn><dd>In this mode, only a single tasks is being debugged.  Any other tasks,
including new tasks created by the task being debugged, are simply
ignored (their execution is not controlled by the debugger).

     <p><a name="index-VxWorks_002c-Multitasks-Mode-Debugging-1490"></a><br><dt><dfn>Multitasks Mode</dfn><dd>This is a mode specific to Ada programs where the debugger simulates
the concept of debugging a process. This is useful when trying to debug
an Ada program that uses the multi-tasking features of Ada.

     <p>When debugging in this mode, all Ada tasks controlled by the Ada
run-time library are under <span class="sc">gdb</span> control, and their execution
is automatically stopped or resumed as needed.  In particular, when
attaching to a task, all associated tasks in the same Ada "program"
are automatically stopped and put under debugger control.  New tasks
being spawned by the Ada "program" are also automatically taken under
debugger control.

     <p>This mode is specific to Ada programs because it, because it relies
on the Ada runtime in order to extract the list of tasks currently
running as part of the Ada program.

     <p><a name="index-VxWorks_002c-System-Mode-Debugging-1491"></a><br><dt><dfn>The System Mode</dfn><dd>
In this mode, the debugger controls the entire system as one process,
including part of the system such as the scheduler, interrupt handlers,
etc.  To enter System Mode, simply use the <code>attach system</code> command. 
To leave System Mode, use <code>detach</code>. 
</dl>

     
<a name="index-set-multi_002dtasks_002dmode-1492"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set multi-tasks-mode [on|off]</code><dd>If <code>on</code>, activate multi-tasks mode.  The default is <code>off</code>. 
This setting should be properly set before using the <code>attach</code>
or <code>run</code> command.  As long as GDB controls the execution of one
or more tasks, attempting to change this setting will result in an
error.

     <p>This setting is ignored when debugging in System Mode.

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.2 Debugging on VxWorks 653</h5>

<p>Debugging on VxWorks 653 is very similar to debugging on VxWorks 5,
and the commands available for VxWorks 5 are also generally available
for VxWorks 653.

   <p>The one important distinction is the fact that VxWorks 653 provides
the concept of <dfn>Partitions</dfn>, as defined by the ARINC 653
specification.  These partitions usually have their own address space,
and allow the user to make sure that tasks running in one partition
cannot affect tasks running on another partition (on VxWorks AE,
which is an ancestor of VxWorks 653, these partitions were called
<dfn>Protection Domains</dfn>, or <dfn>PD</dfn> in short).  Please refer to your
VxWorks 653 manual for more information about the various types of
partitions and their use.

     
<a name="index-info-partitions-1493"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info partitions</code><dd>Print the list of existing partitions on the target system.  Each line
corresponds to a partition, and contains its ID and name.  An asterisk

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.3 Commands and Settings Related to WTX</h5>

<p>The following Settings are provided:

     
<a name="index-set-wtx-tool_002dname-1496"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set wtx tool-name </code><var>name</var><dd>This command can be used to change the name of the tool given to
the Target Server when establishing the connection.  This is only
for documentation and logging purposes as this has no effect on
the debugging session.  The default is <code>gdb</code>.

     <p><a name="index-show-wtx-tool_002dname-1497"></a><br><dt><code>show wtx tool-name</code><dd>Display the tool name used when establishing a connection with the
WTX server.

     <p><a name="index-set-wtx-load_002dtimeout-1498"></a><br><dt><code>set wtx load-timeout </code><var>timeout</var><dd>Change the timeout (in seconds) used when loading new modules on
the target.  The default is 30 seconds.

     <p><a name="index-show-wtx-load_002dtimeout-1499"></a><br><dt><code>show wtx load-timeout</code><dd>Print the timeout duration used when loading modules on the target.

     <p><a name="index-set-wtx-load_002dfrom_002dgdb-1500"></a><br><dt><code>set wtx load-from-gdb </code><var>arg</var><dd>If set to <code>on</code>, GDB reads the module, and transmits it to
the target server in order to get it loaded.  When set to <code>off</code>
(the default), GDB just sends the module's filename to the target
server, letting the target server read and send the module to
the target.  The latter option is significantly faster, but requires
that the target server have file access to the module and that the path
to that module be the same for GDB and the target server.  Running
GDB and the target server on the same host ensures that this requirement
is met.

     <p><a name="index-show-wtx-load_002dfrom_002dgdb-1501"></a><br><dt><code>show wtx load-timeout</code><dd>Show the value of the <code>wtx load-from-gdb</code> setting.

(using the <code>run</code> command).  This does not affect the stack size
of a task spawned by other tasks, even if those tasks are under debugger
control.  The default is 0x10000 bytes.

     <p><a name="index-show-wtx-stack_002dsize-1503"></a><br><dt><code>show wtx stack-size</code><dd>Display the size of the stack allocated when spawning a new task from

   <p>Some of the information (such as the list of tasks currently running

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.4 Debugging on VxWorks 6</h5>

<p>Debugging on VxWorks 6 follows the same principles as those for
debugging VxWorks 5.  The main difference is that <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs
to connect to a DFW server in addition to the Target Server.  The
<dfn>DFW server</dfn> is another server running on the host (see your
VxWorks 6 Manuals for more information about this process).

   <p>To start a debugging session, use the <code>target dfw</code> command. 
It will get both DFW and WTX connections established (therefore, do
not use the <code>target wtx</code> command with VxWorks 6).

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.5 Commands and Settings Related to DFW</h5>

<p>The following settings are provided:

     
<a name="index-set-dfw-timeout-1522"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set dfw timeout </code><var>duration</var><dd>Change the timeout (in seconds) used when trying to read from the

     <p><a name="index-show-dfw-timeout-1523"></a><br><dt><code>show dfw timeout</code><dd>Show the duration in seconds before an attempt to read data from
the DFW server should time out.

     <p><a name="index-set-dfw-server_002dname-1524"></a><br><dt><code>set dfw server-name </code><var>name</var><dd>Set the name of the DFW server as registered in the WIND registry. 
By default, it is set to <code>dfw</code>; if only one DFW server is
registered in the registry, GDB will connect to this server by
default.

     <p><a name="index-show-dfw-server_002dname-1525"></a><br><dt><code>show dfw server-name</code><dd>Show the name of the DFW server.

   </dl>

   <p>The following commands may be useful to <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintainers
wishing to instrument the part of the code in <span class="sc">gdb</span>
responsible for supporting the DFW protocol.

     
<a name="index-dfw-send-1526"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.2.1.6 VxWorks Module Handling</h5>

<p><a name="index-VxWorks_002c-Module-Handling-1533"></a>
Unlike most Operating Systems, the loading of modules in memory has
to be performed manually by the user.  Modules can be a self-contained
program, or just part of a program consisting of multiple modules
(this is similar to programs depending on shared libraries).

   <p>To load a new module on the target, use the <code>load</code> command. 
In addition to loading the module on the target, the debugger will
also load its symbol table and debugging information.

   <p>Modules may also be unloaded at any time, using the <code>unload</code>
command.

     
<a name="index-wtx-add_002dsymbol_002dfile-1534"></a>
<dl><dt><code>wtx add-symbol-file </code><var>file</var><dd>This command is similar to the <code>add-symbol-file</code> command, except
that it does not require base addresses to be provided.  Instead,
these addresses are automatically computed based on some information
provided by the Target Server.

     <p>This command is normally rarely needed, since GDB should
automatically load the symbols from all modules either when
connecting to the target, or when the module is loaded on the
target.  But this may become useful when the module fullpath
provided by the target server does not correspond to the
module's fullpath on the host where GDB is running.

The MicroBlaze is a soft-core processor supported on various Xilinx
FPGAs, such as Spartan or Virtex series.  Boards with these processors
usually have JTAG ports which connect to a host system running the Xilinx
Embedded Development Kit (EDK) or Software Development Kit (SDK). 
This host system is used to download the configuration bitstream to
the target FPGA.  The Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) program
communicates with the target board using the JTAG interface and
presents a <code>gdbserver</code> interface to the board.  By default
<code>xmd</code> uses port <code>1234</code>.  (While it is possible to change
this default port, it requires the use of undocumented <code>xmd</code>
commands.  Contact Xilinx support if you need to do this.)

you configure <span class="sc">gdb</span> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--target=mips-elf</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Use these <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands to specify the connection to your target board:

     <dl>
<dt><code>target mips </code><var>port</var><dd><a name="index-target-mips-_0040var_007bport_007d-1578"></a>To run a program on the board, start up <code>gdb</code> with the

the serial port connected to the board.  If the program has not already
been downloaded to the board, you may use the <code>load</code> command to
download it.  You can then use all the usual <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands.

     <p>For example, this sequence connects to the target board through a serial
port, and loads and runs a program called <var>prog</var> through the

coprocessor, you should use the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set mipsfpu none</span></samp>&rsquo; (if you
need this, you may wish to put the command in your <span class="sc">gdb</span> init
file).  This tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to find the return value of
functions which return floating point values.  It also allows
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to avoid saving the floating point registers when calling
functions on the board.  If you are using a floating point coprocessor
with only single precision floating point support, as on the <span class="sc">r4650</span>
processor, use the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set mipsfpu single</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The default
double precision floating point coprocessor may be selected using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set mipsfpu double</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no
floating point, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set mipsfpu on</span></samp>&rsquo; will select double precision
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set mipsfpu off</span></samp>&rsquo; will select no floating point.

<h4 class="subsection">21.3.6 PowerPC Embedded</h4>

<p><a name="index-DVC-register-1604"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> supports using the DVC (Data Value Compare) register to
implement in hardware simple hardware watchpoint conditions of the form:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) watch <var>ADDRESS|VARIABLE</var> \
       if  <var>ADDRESS|VARIABLE</var> == <var>CONSTANT EXPRESSION</var>
</pre>
   <p>The DVC register will be automatically used when <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects
such pattern in a condition expression, and the created watchpoint uses one
debug register (either the <code>exact-watchpoints</code> option is on and the
variable is scalar, or the variable has a length of one byte).  This feature
is available in native <span class="sc">gdb</span> running on a Linux kernel version 2.6.34
or newer.

   <p>When running on PowerPC embedded processors, <span class="sc">gdb</span> automatically uses
ranged hardware watchpoints, unless the <code>exact-watchpoints</code> option is on,
in which case watchpoints using only one debug register are created when
watching variables of scalar types.

   <p>You can create an artificial array to watch an arbitrary memory
region using one of the following commands (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>):

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) watch *((char *) <var>address</var>)@<var>length</var>
     (gdb) watch {char[<var>length</var>]} <var>address</var>
</pre>
   <p>PowerPC embedded processors support masked watchpoints.  See the discussion
about the <code>mask</code> argument in <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Set Watchpoints</a>.

   <p><a name="index-ranged-breakpoint-1605"></a>PowerPC embedded processors support hardware accelerated
<dfn>ranged breakpoints</dfn>.  A ranged breakpoint stops execution of
the inferior whenever it executes an instruction at any address within
the range it specifies.  To set a ranged breakpoint in <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
use the <code>break-range</code> command.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the following PowerPC-specific commands:

     
<a name="index-break_002drange-1606"></a>
<dl><dt><code>break-range </code><var>start-location</var><code>, </code><var>end-location</var><dd>Set a breakpoint for an address range given by
<var>start-location</var> and <var>end-location</var>, which can specify a function name,
a line number, an offset of lines from the current line or from the start
location, or an address of an instruction (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>,
for a list of all the possible ways to specify a <var>location</var>.)

</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> then attempts to read the symbol table of <samp><span class="file">prog</span></samp>. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> locates

<span class="sc">gdb</span> locates
the source files by searching the directories listed in the directory search

<h5 class="subsubsection">21.3.8.3 Sparclet Download</h5>

<p><a name="index-download-to-Sparclet-1622"></a>Once connected to the Sparclet target,
you can use the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>load</code> command to download the file from the host to the target. 
The file name and load offset should be given as arguments to the <code>load</code>
command. 
Since the file format is aout, the program must be loaded to the starting
address.  You can use <code>objdump</code> to find out what this value is.  The load
offset is an offset which is added to the VMA (virtual memory address)
of each of the file's sections. 
For instance, if the program
<samp><span class="file">prog</span></samp> was linked to text address 0x1201000, with data at 0x12010160
and bss at 0x12010170, in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, type:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdbslet) load prog 0x12010000
     Loading section .text, size 0xdb0 vma 0x12010000
</pre>
   <p>If the code is loaded at a different address then what the program was linked
to, you may need to use the <code>section</code> and <code>add-symbol-file</code> commands
to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> where to map the symbol table.

When configured for debugging Zilog Z8000 targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> includes
a Z8000 simulator.

   <p>For the Z8000 family, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target sim</span></samp>&rsquo; simulates either the Z8002 (the
unsegmented variant of the Z8000 architecture) or the Z8001 (the
segmented variant).  The simulator recognizes which architecture is
appropriate by inspecting the object code.

options, specify them via <var>args</var>. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">After specifying this target, you can debug programs for the simulated
CPU in the same style as programs for your host computer; use the
<code>file</code> command to load a new program image, the <code>run</code> command
to run your program, and so on.

   <p>As well as making available all the usual machine registers
(see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>), the Z8000 simulator provides three
additional items of information as specially named registers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>cycles</code><dd>Counts clock-ticks in the simulator.

     <br><dt><code>insts</code><dd>Counts instructions run in the simulator.

     <br><dt><code>time</code><dd>Execution time in 60ths of a second.

   </dl>

   <p>You can refer to these values in <span class="sc">gdb</span> expressions with the usual
conventions; for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b&nbsp;fputc&nbsp;if&nbsp;$cycles&gt;5000</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> sets a
conditional breakpoint that suspends only after at least 5000

Memory Protection Extension (MPX) adds the bound registers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BND0</span></samp>&rsquo;
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-16" name="fnd-16"><sup>16</sup></a> through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BND3</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Bound registers store a pair of 64-bit values
which are the lower bound and upper bound.  Bounds are effective addresses or
memory locations.  The upper bounds are architecturally represented in 1's
complement form.  A bound having lower bound = 0, and upper bound = 0
(1's complement of all bits set) will allow access to the entire address space.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BND0</span></samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BND3</span></samp>&rsquo; are represented in <span class="sc">gdb</span> as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bnd0raw</span></samp>&rsquo;

display the upper bound performing the complement of one operation on the
upper bound value, i.e. when upper bound in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bnd0raw</span></samp>&rsquo; is 0 in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bnd0</span></samp>&rsquo; it will be <code>0xfff...</code>.  In this sense it
can also be noted that the upper bounds are inclusive.

   <p>As an example, assume that the register BND0 holds bounds for a pointer having
access allowed for the range between 0x32 and 0x71.  The values present on
bnd0raw and bnd registers are presented as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     	bnd0raw = {0x32, 0xffffffff8e}
     	bnd0 = {lbound = 0x32, ubound = 0x71} : size 64

   <p>This way the raw value can be accessed via bnd0raw<small class="dots">...</small>bnd3raw.  Any
change on bnd0<small class="dots">...</small>bnd3 or bnd0raw<small class="dots">...</small>bnd3raw is reflect on its
counterpart.  When the bnd0<small class="dots">...</small>bnd3 registers are displayed via
Python, the display includes the memory size, in bits, accessible to
the pointer.

   <p>Bounds can also be stored in bounds tables, which are stored in
application memory.  These tables store bounds for pointers by specifying
the bounds pointer's value along with its bounds.  Evaluating and changing
bounds located in bound tables is therefore interesting while investigating
bugs on MPX context.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides commands for this purpose:

     <dl>
<dt><code>show mpx bound </code><var>pointer</var><dd><a name="index-show-mpx-bound-1647"></a>Display bounds of the given <var>pointer</var>.

     <br><dt><code>set mpx bound </code><var>pointer</var><code>, </code><var>lbound</var><code>, </code><var>ubound</var><dd><a name="index-set-mpx-bound-1648"></a>Set the bounds of a pointer in the bound table. 
This command takes three parameters: <var>pointer</var> is the pointers
whose bounds are to be changed, <var>lbound</var> and <var>ubound</var> are new values
for lower and upper bounds respectively.

<h3 class="section">22.1 Prompt</h3>

<p><a name="index-prompt-1680"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> indicates its readiness to read a command by printing a string
called the <dfn>prompt</dfn>.  This string is normally &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(gdb)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You
can change the prompt string with the <code>set prompt</code> command.  For
instance, when debugging <span class="sc">gdb</span> with <span class="sc">gdb</span>, it is useful to change
the prompt in one of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> sessions so that you can always tell
which one you are talking to.

   <p><em>Note:</em>  <code>set prompt</code> does not add a space for you after the
prompt you set.  This allows you to set a prompt which ends in a space
or a prompt that does not.

     
<a name="index-set-prompt-1681"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set prompt </code><var>newprompt</var><dd>Directs <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use <var>newprompt</var> as its prompt string henceforth.

     <p><a name="index-show-prompt-1682"></a><br><dt><code>show prompt</code><dd>Prints a line of the form: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Gdb's prompt is: </span><var>your-prompt</var></samp>&rsquo;
</dl>

   <p>Versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> that ship with Python scripting enabled have
prompt extensions.  The commands for interacting with these extensions
are:

     
<a name="index-set-extended_002dprompt-1683"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set extended-prompt </code><var>prompt</var><dd>Set an extended prompt that allows for substitutions. 
See <a href="#gdb_002eprompt">gdb.prompt</a>, for a list of escape sequences that can be used for
substitution.  Any escape sequences specified as part of the prompt
string are replaced with the corresponding strings each time the prompt
is displayed.

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          set extended-prompt Current working directory: \w (gdb)
</pre>
     <p>Note that when an extended-prompt is set, it takes control of the
<var>prompt_hook</var> hook.  See <a href="#prompt_005fhook">prompt_hook</a>, for further information.

     <p><a name="index-show-extended_002dprompt-1684"></a><br><dt><code>show extended-prompt</code><dd>Prints the extended prompt.  Any escape sequences specified as part of

<h3 class="section">22.3 Command History</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-history-1690"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can keep track of the commands you type during your
debugging sessions, so that you can be certain of precisely what
happened.  Use these commands to manage the <span class="sc">gdb</span> command
history facility.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the <span class="sc">gnu</span> History library, a part of the Readline
package, to provide the history facility. 
See <a href="#Using-History-Interactively">Using History Interactively</a>,
for the detailed description of the History library.

   <p>To issue a command to <span class="sc">gdb</span> without affecting certain aspects of
the state which is seen by users, prefix it with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">server </span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#Server-Prefix">Server Prefix</a>).  This
means that this command will not affect the command history, nor will it
affect <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s notion of which command to repeat if &lt;RET&gt; is
pressed on a line by itself.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bserver_007d_002c-command-prefix-1691"></a>The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the value
history; to print a value without recording it into the value history,
use the <code>output</code> command instead of the <code>print</code> command.

   <p>History expansion assigns special meaning to the character <kbd>!</kbd>. 
See <a href="#Event-Designators">Event Designators</a>,
for more details.

   <p><a name="index-history-expansion_002c-turn-on_002foff-1703"></a>Since <kbd>!</kbd> is also the logical not operator in C, history expansion
is off by default. If you decide to enable history expansion with the
<code>set history expansion on</code> command, you may sometimes need to
follow <kbd>!</kbd> (when it is used as logical not, in an expression) with
a space or a tab to prevent it from being expanded.  The readline
history facilities do not attempt substitution on the strings
<kbd>!=</kbd> and <kbd>!(</kbd>, even when history expansion is enabled.

   <p>The commands to control history expansion are:

     <dl>

Certain commands to <span class="sc">gdb</span> may produce large amounts of
information output to the screen.  To help you read all of it,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> pauses and asks you for input at the end of each page of
output.  Type &lt;RET&gt; when you want to continue the output, or <kbd>q</kbd>
to discard the remaining output.  Also, the screen width setting
determines when to wrap lines of output.  Depending on what is being
printed, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to break the line at a readable place,
rather than simply letting it overflow onto the following line.

   <p>Normally <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows the size of the screen from the terminal
driver software.  For example, on Unix <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the termcap data base
together with the value of the <code>TERM</code> environment variable and the
<code>stty rows</code> and <code>stty cols</code> settings.  If this is not correct,
you can override it with the <code>set height</code> and <code>set
width</code> commands:

     
<a name="index-set-height-1714"></a>
<a name="index-set-width-1715"></a>
<a name="index-show-width-1716"></a>
<a name="index-show-height-1717"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set height </code><var>lpp</var><dt><code>set height unlimited</code><dt><code>show height</code><dt><code>set width </code><var>cpl</var><dt><code>set width unlimited</code><dt><code>show width</code><dd>These <code>set</code> commands specify a screen height of <var>lpp</var> lines and
a screen width of <var>cpl</var> characters.  The associated <code>show</code>
commands display the current settings.

     <p>If you specify a height of either <code>unlimited</code> or zero lines,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> does not pause during output no matter how long the
output is.  This is useful if output is to a file or to an editor
buffer.

     <p>Likewise, you can specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set width unlimited</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set
width 0</span></samp>&rsquo; to prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from wrapping its output.

     <br><dt><code>set pagination on</code><dt><code>set pagination off</code><dd><a name="index-set-pagination-1718"></a>Turn the output pagination on or off; the default is on.  Turning
pagination off is the alternative to <code>set height unlimited</code>.  Note that
running <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the <samp><span class="option">--batch</span></samp> option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">-batch</a>) also automatically disables pagination.

You can always enter numbers in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal in

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;, decimal numbers end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, and hexadecimal numbers
begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Numbers that neither begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; or

10; likewise, the default display for numbers&mdash;when no particular
format is specified&mdash;is base 10.  You can change the default base for
both input and output with the commands described below.

     <p class="noindent">sets the input base to decimal.  On the other hand, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set input-radix 10</span></samp>&rsquo;
leaves the input radix unchanged, no matter what it was, since
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>&rsquo;, being without any leading or trailing signs of its base, is
interpreted in the current radix.  Thus, if the current radix is 16,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>&rsquo; is interpreted in hex, i.e. as 16 decimal, which doesn't
change the radix.

<h3 class="section">22.6 Configuring the Current ABI</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can determine the <dfn>ABI</dfn> (Application Binary Interface) of your
application automatically.  However, sometimes you need to override its
conclusions.  Use these commands to manage <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s view of the
current ABI.

   <p><a name="index-OS-ABI-1728"></a><a name="index-set-osabi-1729"></a><a name="index-show-osabi-1730"></a><a name="index-Newlib-OS-ABI-and-its-influence-on-the-longjmp-handling-1731"></a>
One <span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration can debug binaries for multiple operating
system targets, either via remote debugging or native emulation. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will autodetect the <dfn>OS ABI</dfn> (Operating System ABI) in use,
but you can override its conclusion using the <code>set osabi</code> command. 
One example where this is useful is in debugging of binaries which use
an alternate C library (e.g. <span class="sc">uClibc</span> for <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux) which does
not have the same identifying marks that the standard C library for your
platform provides.

   <p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides a
&ldquo;Newlib&rdquo; OS ABI.  This is useful for handling <code>setjmp</code> and
<code>longjmp</code> when debugging binaries that use the <span class="sc">newlib</span> C library. 
The &ldquo;Newlib&rdquo; OS ABI can be selected by <code>set osabi Newlib</code>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>show osabi</code><dd>Show the OS ABI currently in use.

     <br><dt><code>set osabi</code><dd>With no argument, show the list of registered available OS ABI's.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-float-promotion-1732"></a>
Generally, the way that an argument of type <code>float</code> is passed to a
function depends on whether the function is prototyped.  For a prototyped
(i.e. ANSI/ISO style) function, <code>float</code> arguments are passed unchanged,
according to the architecture's convention for <code>float</code>.  For unprototyped
(i.e. K&amp;R style) functions, <code>float</code> arguments are first promoted to type
<code>double</code> and then passed.

   <p>Unfortunately, some forms of debug information do not reliably indicate whether
a function is prototyped.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span> calls a function that is not marked
as prototyped, it consults <kbd>set coerce-float-to-double</kbd>.

Currently supported ABI's include &ldquo;gnu-v2&rdquo;, for <code>g++</code> versions

<h3 class="section">22.7 Automatically loading associated files</h3>

<p><a name="index-auto_002dloading-1737"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sometimes reads files with commands and settings automatically,
without being explicitly told so by the user.  We call this feature
<dfn>auto-loading</dfn>.  While auto-loading is useful for automatically adapting
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to the needs of your project, it can sometimes produce unexpected
results or introduce security risks (e.g., if the file comes from untrusted
sources).

<ul class="menu">

</ul>

   <p>There are various kinds of files <span class="sc">gdb</span> can automatically load. 
In addition to these files, <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports auto-loading code written
in various extension languages.  See <a href="#Auto_002dloading-extensions">Auto-loading extensions</a>.

   <p>Note that loading of these associated files (including the local <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp>
file) requires accordingly configured <code>auto-load safe-path</code>
(see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).

   <p>For these reasons, <span class="sc">gdb</span> includes commands and options to let you
control when to auto-load files and which files should be auto-loaded.

     <dl>

You may want to use this command with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-iex</span></samp>&rsquo; option
(see <a href="#Option-_002dinit_002deval_002dcommand">Option -init-eval-command</a>) such as:

and init files from your home directory (see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>)
still get read (as they come from generally trusted directories). 
To prevent <span class="sc">gdb</span> from auto-loading even those init files, use the

<h4 class="subsection">22.7.3 Security restriction for auto-loading</h4>

<p><a name="index-auto_002dloading-safe_002dpath-1749"></a>
As the files of inferior can come from untrusted source (such as submitted by
an application user) <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not always load any files automatically. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load safe-path</span></samp>&rsquo; setting to list
directories trusted for loading files not explicitly requested by user. 
Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern.

   <p>If the path is not set properly you will see a warning and the file will not
get loaded:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ ./gdb -q ./gdb
     Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/gdb...done.
     warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.gdb" auto-loading has been
              declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
              to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
     warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.py" auto-loading has been
              declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
              to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To instruct <span class="sc">gdb</span> to go ahead and use the init files anyway,
invoke <span class="sc">gdb</span> like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gdb -q -iex "set auto-load safe-path /home/user/gdb" ./gdb
</pre>
   <p>The list of trusted directories is controlled by the following commands:

     <dl>
<a name="set-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a><a name="index-set-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath-1750"></a><dt><code>set auto-load safe-path </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>directories</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Set the list of directories (and their subdirectories) trusted for automatic
loading and execution of scripts.  You can also enter a specific trusted file. 
Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern; wildcards do not match
directory separator - see <code>FNM_PATHNAME</code> for system function <code>fnmatch</code>
(see <a href="libc.html#Wildcard-Matching">fnmatch</a>). 
If you omit <var>directories</var>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto-load safe-path</span></samp>&rsquo; will be reset to
its default value as specified during <span class="sc">gdb</span> compilation.

     <p>The list of directories uses path separator (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; on GNU and Unix
systems, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; on MS-Windows and MS-DOS) to separate directories, similarly
to the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable.

     <p><a name="show-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a><a name="index-show-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath-1751"></a><br><dt><code>show auto-load safe-path</code><dd>Show the list of directories trusted for automatic loading and execution of

automatic loading and execution of scripts.  Multiple entries may be delimited
by the host platform path separator in use. 
</dl>

   <p>This variable defaults to what <code>--with-auto-load-dir</code> has been configured
to (see <a href="#with_002dauto_002dload_002ddir">with-auto-load-dir</a>).  <samp><span class="file">$debugdir</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">$datadir</span></samp>
substitution applies the same as for <a href="#set-auto_002dload-scripts_002ddirectory">set auto-load scripts-directory</a>. 
The default <code>set auto-load safe-path</code> value can be also overriden by
<span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration option <samp><span class="option">--with-auto-load-safe-path</span></samp>.

   <p>Setting this variable to <samp><span class="file">/</span></samp> disables this security protection,
corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration option is
<samp><span class="option">--without-auto-load-safe-path</span></samp>. 
This variable is supposed to be set to the system directories writable by the
system superuser only.  Users can add their source directories in init files in
their home directories (see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>).  See also deprecated
init file in the current directory
(see <a href="#Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup">Init File in the Current Directory during Startup</a>).

   <p>To force <span class="sc">gdb</span> to load the files it declined to load in the previous
example, you could use one of the following ways:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">add-auto-load-safe-path ~/src/gdb</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Specify this trusted directory (or a file) as additional component of the list. 
You have to specify also any existing directories displayed by
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show auto-load safe-path</span></samp>&rsquo; (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/usr:/bin</span></samp>&rsquo; in this example).

     <br><dt><kbd>gdb -iex "set auto-load safe-path /usr:/bin:~/src/gdb" ...</kbd><dd>Specify this directory as in the previous case but just for a single
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session.

     <br><dt><kbd>gdb -iex "set auto-load safe-path /" ...</kbd><dd>Disable auto-loading safety for a single <span class="sc">gdb</span> session. 
This assumes all the files you debug during this <span class="sc">gdb</span> session will come
from trusted sources.

     <br><dt><kbd>./configure --without-auto-load-safe-path</kbd><dd>During compilation of <span class="sc">gdb</span> you may disable any auto-loading safety. 
This assumes all the files you will ever debug with this <span class="sc">gdb</span> come from
trusted sources. 
</dl>

   <p>On the other hand you can also explicitly forbid automatic files loading which
also suppresses any such warning messages:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>gdb -iex "set auto-load no" ...</kbd><dd>You can use <span class="sc">gdb</span> command-line option for a single <span class="sc">gdb</span> session.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load no</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Disable auto-loading globally for the user
(see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>).  While it is improbable, you could also
use system init file instead (see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>). 
</dl>

   <p>This setting applies to the file names as entered by user.  If no entry matches
<span class="sc">gdb</span> tries as a last resort to also resolve all the file names into
their canonical form (typically resolving symbolic links) and compare the
entries again.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> already canonicalizes most of the filenames on its
own before starting the comparison so a canonical form of directories is
recommended to be entered.

For better visibility of all the file locations where you can place scripts to
be auto-loaded with inferior &mdash; or to protect yourself against accidental
execution of untrusted scripts &mdash; <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a feature for printing
all the files attempted to be loaded.  Both existing and non-existing files may
be printed.

   <p>For example the list of directories from which it is safe to auto-load files
(see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>) applies also to canonicalized filenames which
may not be too obvious while setting it up.

<h3 class="section">22.8 Optional Warnings and Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-verbose-operation-1756"></a><a name="index-optional-warnings-1757"></a>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is silent about its inner workings.  If you are
running on a slow machine, you may want to use the <code>set verbose</code>
command.  This makes <span class="sc">gdb</span> tell you when it does a lengthy
internal operation, so you will not think it has crashed.

   <p>Currently, the messages controlled by <code>set verbose</code> are those
which announce that the symbol table for a source file is being read;
see <code>symbol-file</code> in <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.

     
<a name="index-set-verbose-1758"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set verbose on</code><dd>Enables <span class="sc">gdb</span> output of certain informational messages.

     <br><dt><code>set verbose off</code><dd>Disables <span class="sc">gdb</span> output of certain informational messages.

     <p><a name="index-show-verbose-1759"></a><br><dt><code>show verbose</code><dd>Displays whether <code>set verbose</code> is on or off. 
</dl>

   <p>By default, if <span class="sc">gdb</span> encounters bugs in the symbol table of an
object file, it is silent; but if you are debugging a compiler, you may
find this information useful (see <a href="#Symbol-Errors">Errors Reading Symbol Files</a>).

     
<a name="index-set-complaints-1760"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set complaints </code><var>limit</var><dd>Permits <span class="sc">gdb</span> to output <var>limit</var> complaints about each type of

<var>limit</var> to zero to suppress all complaints; set it to a large number
to prevent complaints from being suppressed.

     <p><a name="index-show-complaints-1761"></a><br><dt><code>show complaints</code><dd>Displays how many symbol complaints <span class="sc">gdb</span> is permitted to produce.

   </dl>

   <p><a name="confirmation-requests"></a>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is cautious, and asks what sometimes seems to be a
lot of stupid questions to confirm certain commands.  For example, if

     The program being debugged has been started already.
     Start it from the beginning? (y or n)

<h2 class="chapter">23 Extending <span class="sc">gdb</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-extending-GDB-1817"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides several mechanisms for extension. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> also provides the ability to automatically load
extensions when it reads a file for debugging.  This allows the
user to automatically customize <span class="sc">gdb</span> for the program
being debugged.

</ul>

   <p>To facilitate the use of extension languages, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is capable
of evaluating the contents of a file.  When doing so, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
can recognize which extension language is being used by looking at
the filename extension.  Files with an unrecognized filename extension
are always treated as a <span class="sc">gdb</span> Command Files. 
See <a href="#Command-Files">Command files</a>.

   <p>You can control how <span class="sc">gdb</span> evaluates these files with the following
setting:

     
<a name="index-set-script_002dextension-1818"></a>
<a name="index-show-script_002dextension-1819"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set script-extension off</code><dd>All scripts are always evaluated as <span class="sc">gdb</span> Command Files.

     <br><dt><code>set script-extension soft</code><dd>The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
extension.  If this scripting language is supported, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
evaluates the script using that language.  Otherwise, it evaluates
the file as a <span class="sc">gdb</span> Command File.

     <br><dt><code>set script-extension strict</code><dd>The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
extension, and evaluates the script using that language.  If the

<p><a name="index-user_002ddefined-command-1820"></a><a name="index-arguments_002c-to-user_002ddefined-commands-1821"></a>A <dfn>user-defined command</dfn> is a sequence of <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands to
which you assign a new name as a command.  This is done with the
<code>define</code> command.  User commands may accept up to 10 arguments
separated by whitespace.  Arguments are accessed within the user command
via <code>$arg0...$arg9</code>.  A trivial example:

<pre class="smallexample">     define adder
       print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
     end
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To execute the command use:

<pre class="smallexample">     adder 1 2 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This defines the command <code>adder</code>, which prints the sum of
its three arguments.  Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may
reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior
functions calls.

   <p><a name="index-argument-count-in-user_002ddefined-commands-1822"></a><a name="index-how-many-arguments-_0028user_002ddefined-commands_0029-1823"></a>In addition, <code>$argc</code> may be used to find out how many arguments have
been passed.  This expands to a number in the range 0<small class="dots">...</small>10.

<pre class="smallexample">     define adder
       if $argc == 2
         print $arg0 + $arg1
       end
       if $argc == 3
         print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
       end
     end
</pre>
     
<a name="index-define-1824"></a>
<dl><dt><code>define </code><var>commandname</var><dd>Define a command named <var>commandname</var>.  If there is already a command
by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine it. 
The argument <var>commandname</var> may be a bare command name consisting of letters,
numbers, dashes, and underscores.  It may also start with any predefined
prefix command.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">define target my-target</span></samp>&rsquo; creates
a user-defined &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target my-target</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

     <p>The definition of the command is made up of other <span class="sc">gdb</span> command lines,
which are given following the <code>define</code> command.  The end of these
commands is marked by a line containing <code>end</code>.

     <p><a name="index-document-1825"></a><a name="index-end_0040r_007b-_0028user_002ddefined-commands_0029_007d-1826"></a><br><dt><code>document </code><var>commandname</var><dd>Document the user-defined command <var>commandname</var>, so that it can be
accessed by <code>help</code>.  The command <var>commandname</var> must already be
defined.  This command reads lines of documentation just as <code>define</code>
reads the lines of the command definition, ending with <code>end</code>. 
After the <code>document</code> command is finished, <code>help</code> on command
<var>commandname</var> displays the documentation you have written.

     <p>You may use the <code>document</code> command again to change the
documentation of a command.  Redefining the command with <code>define</code>
does not change the documentation.

     <p><a name="index-dont_002drepeat-1827"></a><a name="index-don_0027t-repeat-command-1828"></a><br><dt><code>dont-repeat</code><dd>Used inside a user-defined command, this tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> that this

levels are allowed in user-defined commands before <span class="sc">gdb</span> suspects an
infinite recursion and aborts the command. 
This does not apply to user-defined python commands. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition to the above commands, user-defined commands frequently
use control flow commands, described in <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>.

   <p>When user-defined commands are executed, the
commands of the definition are not printed.  An error in any command
stops execution of the user-defined command.

   <p>If used interactively, commands that would ask for confirmation proceed
without asking when used inside a user-defined command.  Many <span class="sc">gdb</span>
commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the
messages when used in a user-defined command.

<h4 class="subsection">23.1.2 User-defined Command Hooks</h4>

<p><a name="index-command-hooks-1834"></a><a name="index-hooks_002c-for-commands-1835"></a><a name="index-hooks_002c-pre_002dcommand-1836"></a>
<a name="index-hook-1837"></a>You may define <dfn>hooks</dfn>, which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, if the user-defined
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hook-foo</span></samp>&rsquo; exists, it is executed (with no arguments)
before that command.

   <p><a name="index-hooks_002c-post_002dcommand-1838"></a><a name="index-hookpost-1839"></a>A hook may also be defined which is run after the command you executed. 
Whenever you run the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, if the user-defined command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hookpost-foo</span></samp>&rsquo; exists, it is executed (with no arguments) after
that command.  Post-execution hooks may exist simultaneously with
pre-execution hooks, for the same command.

   <p>It is valid for a hook to call the command which it hooks.  If this
occurs, the hook is not re-executed, thereby avoiding infinite recursion.

<!-- It would be nice if hookpost could be passed a parameter indicating -->
<!-- if the command it hooks executed properly or not.  FIXME! -->
   <p><a name="index-stop_0040r_007b_002c-a-pseudo_002dcommand_007d-1840"></a>In addition, a pseudo-command, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stop</span></samp>&rsquo; exists.  Defining
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hook-stop</span></samp>&rsquo;) makes the associated commands execute every time
execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run,
displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.

   <p>For example, to ignore <code>SIGALRM</code> signals while
single-stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution,
you could define:

<pre class="smallexample">     define hook-stop
     handle SIGALRM nopass
     end
     
     define hook-run
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end
     
     define hook-continue
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end
</pre>
   <p>As a further example, to hook at the beginning and end of the <code>echo</code>
command, and to add extra text to the beginning and end of the message,
you could define:

<pre class="smallexample">     define hook-echo
     echo &lt;&lt;&lt;---
     end
     
     define hookpost-echo
     echo ---&gt;&gt;&gt;\n
     end
     
     (gdb) echo Hello World
     &lt;&lt;&lt;---Hello World---&gt;&gt;&gt;
     (gdb)
     
</pre>
   <p>You can define a hook for any single-word command in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but
not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command
name, e.g.  <code>backtrace</code> rather than <code>bt</code>. 
<!-- FIXME!  So how does Joe User discover whether a command is an alias -->
<!-- or not? -->
You can hook a multi-word command by adding <code>hook-</code> or
<code>hookpost-</code> to the last word of the command, e.g. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">define target hook-remote</span></samp>&rsquo; to add a hook to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target remote</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> commands stops and <span class="sc">gdb</span> issues a prompt
(before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).

   <p>If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you
get a warning from the <code>define</code> command.

   <p>The lines in a command file are generally executed sequentially,
unless the order of execution is changed by one of the
<em>flow-control commands</em> described below.  The commands are not
printed as they are executed.  An error in any command terminates
execution of the command file and control is returned to the console.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> first searches for <var>filename</var> in the current directory. 
If the file is not found there, and <var>filename</var> does not specify a
directory, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> also looks for the file on the source search path
(specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">directory</span></samp>&rsquo; command);
except that <samp><span class="file">$cdir</span></samp> is not searched because the compilation directory
is not relevant to scripts.

   <p>If <code>-s</code> is specified, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches for <var>filename</var>
on the search path even if <var>filename</var> specifies a directory. 
The search is done by appending <var>filename</var> to each element of the
search path.  So, for example, if <var>filename</var> is <samp><span class="file">mylib/myscript</span></samp>
and the search path contains <samp><span class="file">/home/user</span></samp> then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
look for the script <samp><span class="file">/home/user/mylib/myscript</span></samp>. 
The search is also done if <var>filename</var> is an absolute path. 
For example, if <var>filename</var> is <samp><span class="file">/tmp/myscript</span></samp> and
the search path contains <samp><span class="file">/home/user</span></samp> then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
look for the script <samp><span class="file">/home/user/tmp/myscript</span></samp>. 
For DOS-like systems, if <var>filename</var> contains a drive specification,
it is stripped before concatenation.  For example, if <var>filename</var> is
<samp><span class="file">d:myscript</span></samp> and the search path contains <samp><span class="file">c:/tmp</span></samp> then <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will look for the script <samp><span class="file">c:/tmp/myscript</span></samp>.

   <p>If <code>-v</code>, for verbose mode, is given then <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays
each command as it is executed.  The option must be given before
<var>filename</var>, and is interpreted as part of the filename anywhere else.

   <p>Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed
without asking when used in a command file.  Many <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands that
normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages
when called from command files.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> also accepts command input from standard input.  In this
mode, normal output goes to standard output and error output goes to
standard error.  Errors in a command file supplied on standard input do
not terminate execution of the command file&mdash;execution continues with
the next command.

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb &lt; cmds &gt; log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
   <p>(The syntax above will vary depending on the shell used.) This example
will execute commands from the file <samp><span class="file">cmds</span></samp>. All output and errors
would be directed to <samp><span class="file">log</span></samp>.

   <p>Since commands stored on command files tend to be more general than
commands typed interactively, they frequently need to deal with
complicated situations, such as different or unexpected values of
variables and symbols, changes in how the program being debugged is
built, etc.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a set of flow-control commands to
deal with these complexities.  Using these commands, you can write
complex scripts that loop over data structures, execute commands
conditionally, etc.

     
<a name="index-if-1845"></a>
<a name="index-else-1846"></a>
<dl><dt><code>if</code><dt><code>else</code><dd>This command allows to include in your script conditionally executed
commands. The <code>if</code> command takes a single argument, which is an
expression to evaluate.  It is followed by a series of commands that
are executed only if the expression is true (its value is nonzero). 
There can then optionally be an <code>else</code> line, followed by a series
of commands that are only executed if the expression was false.  The
end of the list is marked by a line containing <code>end</code>.

     <p><a name="index-while-1847"></a><br><dt><code>while</code><dd>This command allows to write loops.  Its syntax is similar to
<code>if</code>: the command takes a single argument, which is an expression
to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to execute, one per
line, terminated by an <code>end</code>.  These commands are called the
<dfn>body</dfn> of the loop.  The commands in the body of <code>while</code> are
executed repeatedly as long as the expression evaluates to true.

     <p><a name="index-loop_005fbreak-1848"></a><br><dt><code>loop_break</code><dd>This command exits the <code>while</code> loop in whose body it is included. 
Execution of the script continues after that <code>while</code>s <code>end</code>
line.

     <p><a name="index-loop_005fcontinue-1849"></a><br><dt><code>loop_continue</code><dd>This command skips the execution of the rest of the body of commands
in the <code>while</code> loop in whose body it is included.  Execution
branches to the beginning of the <code>while</code> loop, where it evaluates
the controlling expression.

     <p><a name="index-end_0040r_007b-_0028if_002felse_002fwhile-commands_0029_007d-1850"></a><br><dt><code>end</code><dd>Terminate the block of commands that are the body of <code>if</code>,
<code>else</code>, or <code>while</code> flow-control commands.

<h4 class="subsection">23.1.4 Commands for Controlled Output</h4>

<p>During the execution of a command file or a user-defined command, normal
<span class="sc">gdb</span> output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is
explicitly printed by the commands in the definition.  This section
describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you
want.

     
<a name="index-echo-1851"></a>
<dl><dt><code>echo </code><var>text</var><dd><!-- I do not consider backslash-space a standard C escape sequence -->
<!-- because it is not in ANSI. -->
Print <var>text</var>.  Nonprinting characters can be included in
<var>text</var> using C escape sequences, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo; to print a
newline.  <strong>No newline is printed unless you specify one.</strong>
In addition to the standard C escape sequences, a backslash followed
by a space stands for a space.  This is useful for displaying a
string with spaces at the beginning or the end, since leading and
trailing spaces are otherwise trimmed from all arguments. 
To print &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->and foo =&nbsp;<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;, use the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">echo \&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->and foo = \&nbsp;<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>A backslash at the end of <var>text</var> can be used, as in C, to continue
the command onto subsequent lines.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          echo This is some text\n\
          which is continued\n\
          onto several lines.\n
</pre>
     <p>produces the same output as

     <pre class="smallexample">          echo This is some text\n
          echo which is continued\n
          echo onto several lines.\n
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-output-1852"></a><br><dt><code>output </code><var>expression</var><dd>Print the value of <var>expression</var> and nothing but that value: no
newlines, no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span><var>nn</var><span class="samp"> = </span></samp>&rsquo;.  The value is not entered in the
value history either.  See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>, for more information
on expressions.

     <br><dt><code>output/</code><var>fmt</var> <var>expression</var><dd>Print the value of <var>expression</var> in format <var>fmt</var>.  You can use
the same formats as for <code>print</code>.  See <a href="#Output-Formats">Output Formats</a>, for more information.

     <p><a name="index-printf-1853"></a><br><dt><code>printf </code><var>template</var><code>, </code><var>expressions</var><code>...</code><dd>Print the values of one or more <var>expressions</var> under the control of
the string <var>template</var>.  To print several values, make
<var>expressions</var> be a comma-separated list of individual expressions,
which may be either numbers or pointers.  Their values are printed as
specified by <var>template</var>, exactly as a C program would do by
executing the code below:

     <pre class="smallexample">          printf (<var>template</var>, <var>expressions</var>...);
</pre>
     <p>As in <code>C</code> <code>printf</code>, ordinary characters in <var>template</var>
are printed verbatim, while <dfn>conversion specification</dfn> introduced
by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; character cause subsequent <var>expressions</var> to be
evaluated, their values converted and formatted according to type and
style information encoded in the conversion specifications, and then
printed.

     <p>For example, you can print two values in hex like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          printf "foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n", foo, bar-foo
</pre>
     <p><code>printf</code> supports all the standard <code>C</code> conversion
specifications, including the flags and modifiers between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;
character and the conversion letter, with the following exceptions:

          <ul>
<li>The argument-ordering modifiers, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2$</span></samp>&rsquo;, are not supported.

          <li>The modifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is not supported for specifying precision or
width.

          <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo; flag (for separation of digits into groups according to
<code>LC_NUMERIC'</code>) is not supported.

          <li>The type modifiers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hh</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; are not
supported.

          <li>The conversion letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>&rsquo;) is not supported.

          <li>The conversion letters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; are not supported. 
</ul>

     <p class="noindent">Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ll</span></samp>&rsquo; type modifier is supported only if the
underlying <code>C</code> implementation used to build <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports
the <code>long long int</code> type, and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; type modifier is
supported only if <code>long double</code> type is available.

     <p>As in <code>C</code>, <code>printf</code> supports simple backslash-escape
sequences, such as <code>\n</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\"</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\a</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>&rsquo;, that consist of backslash followed by a
single character.  Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences are not
supported.

     <p>Additionally, <code>printf</code> supports conversion specifications for DFP
(<dfn>Decimal Floating Point</dfn>) types using the following length modifiers
together with a floating point specifier. 
letters:

          <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">H</span></samp>&rsquo; for printing <code>Decimal32</code> types.

          <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo; for printing <code>Decimal64</code> types.

          <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DD</span></samp>&rsquo; for printing <code>Decimal128</code> types. 
</ul>

     <p>If the underlying <code>C</code> implementation used to build <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
support for the three length modifiers for DFP types, other modifiers
such as width and precision will also be available for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to use.

     <p>In case there is no such <code>C</code> support, no additional modifiers will be
available and the value will be printed in the standard way.

     <p>Here's an example of printing DFP types using the above conversion letters:
     <pre class="smallexample">          printf "D32: %Hf - D64: %Df - D128: %DDf\n",1.2345df,1.2E10dd,1.2E1dl
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-eval-1854"></a><br><dt><code>eval </code><var>template</var><code>, </code><var>expressions</var><code>...</code><dd>Convert the values of one or more <var>expressions</var> under the control of

<h4 class="subsection">23.2.1 Python Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-python-commands-1863"></a><a name="index-commands-to-access-python-1864"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides two commands for accessing the Python interpreter,
and one related setting:

     
<a name="index-python_002dinteractive-1865"></a>
<a name="index-pi-1866"></a>
<dl><dt><code>python-interactive </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>command</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>pi </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>command</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Without an argument, the <code>python-interactive</code> command can be used
to start an interactive Python prompt.  To return to <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
type the <code>EOF</code> character (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl-D</kbd> on an empty prompt).

     <p>Alternatively, a single-line Python command can be given as an
argument and evaluated.  If the command is an expression, the result
will be printed; otherwise, nothing will be printed.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) python-interactive 2 + 3
          5
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-python-1867"></a><a name="index-py-1868"></a><br><dt><code>python </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>command</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>py </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>command</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>The <code>python</code> command can be used to evaluate Python code.

     <p>If given an argument, the <code>python</code> command will evaluate the
argument as a Python command.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) python print 23
          23
</pre>
     <p>If you do not provide an argument to <code>python</code>, it will act as a
multi-line command, like <code>define</code>.  In this case, the Python
script is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the
<code>python</code> command.  This command list is terminated using a line
containing <code>end</code>.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) python
          Type python script
          End with a line saying just "end".
          &gt;print 23
          &gt;end
          23
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-set-python-print_002dstack-1869"></a><br><dt><code>set python print-stack</code><dd>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will print only the message component of a
Python exception when an error occurs in a Python script.  This can be
controlled using <code>set python print-stack</code>: if <code>full</code>, then
full Python stack printing is enabled; if <code>none</code>, then Python stack
and message printing is disabled; if <code>message</code>, the default, only
the message component of the error is printed. 
</dl>

   <p>It is also possible to execute a Python script from the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
interpreter:

     <dl>
<dt><code>source </code><samp><span class="file">script-name</span></samp><dd>The script name must end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.py</span></samp>&rsquo; and <span class="sc">gdb</span> must be configured
to recognize the script language based on filename extension using
the <code>script-extension</code> setting.  See <a href="#Extending-GDB">Extending GDB</a>.

     <br><dt><code>python execfile ("script-name")</code><dd>This method is based on the <code>execfile</code> Python built-in function,
and thus is always available.

   <p>Functions and methods which have two or more optional arguments allow
them to be specified using keyword syntax.  This allows passing some

<p><a name="index-python-stdout-1872"></a><a name="index-python-pagination-1873"></a>At startup, <span class="sc">gdb</span> overrides Python's <code>sys.stdout</code> and
<code>sys.stderr</code> to print using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s output-paging streams. 
A Python program which outputs to one of these streams may have its
output interrupted by the user (see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  In this
situation, a Python <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exception is thrown.

   <p>Some care must be taken when writing Python code to run in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Two things worth noting in particular:

     <ul>
<li><span class="sc">gdb</span> install handlers for <code>SIGCHLD</code> and <code>SIGINT</code>. 
Python code must not override these, or even change the options using
<code>sigaction</code>.  If your program changes the handling of these
signals, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will most likely stop working correctly.  Note
that it is unfortunately common for GUI toolkits to install a
<code>SIGCHLD</code> handler.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way on
all platforms.  Your Python programs should be aware of this and
should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting a
child process. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.2 Exception Handling</h5>

<p><a name="index-python-exceptions-1918"></a><a name="index-exceptions_002c-python-1919"></a>
When executing the <code>python</code> command, Python exceptions
uncaught within the Python code are translated to calls to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> error-reporting mechanism.  If the command that called
<code>python</code> does not handle the error, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
terminate it and print an error message containing the Python
exception name, the associated value, and the Python call stack
backtrace at the point where the exception was raised.  Example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) python print foo
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
     NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> errors that happen in <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands invoked by
Python code are converted to Python exceptions.  The type of the
Python exception depends on the error.

     <dl>
<dt><code>gdb.error</code><a name="index-gdb_002eerror-1920"></a><dd>This is the base class for most exceptions generated by <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
It is derived from <code>RuntimeError</code>, for compatibility with earlier
versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>If an error occurring in <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not fit into some more
specific category, then the generated exception will have this type.

     <br><dt><code>gdb.MemoryError</code><a name="index-gdb_002eMemoryError-1921"></a><dd>This is a subclass of <code>gdb.error</code> which is thrown when an
operation tried to access invalid memory in the inferior.

     <br><dt><code>KeyboardInterrupt</code><a name="index-KeyboardInterrupt-1922"></a><dd>User interrupt (via <kbd>C-c</kbd> or by typing <kbd>q</kbd> at a pagination
prompt) is translated to a Python <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exception. 
</dl>

   <p>In all cases, your exception handler will see the <span class="sc">gdb</span> error
message as its value and the Python call stack backtrace at the Python
statement closest to where the <span class="sc">gdb</span> error occured as the
traceback.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002eGdbError-1923"></a>When implementing <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands in Python via <code>gdb.Command</code>,
it is useful to be able to throw an exception that doesn't cause a
traceback to be printed.  For example, the user may have invoked the
command incorrectly.  Use the <code>gdb.GdbError</code> exception
to handle this case.  Example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) python
     &gt;class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
     &gt;  """Greet the whole world."""
     &gt;  def __init__ (self):
     &gt;    super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)
     &gt;  def invoke (self, args, from_tty):
     &gt;    argv = gdb.string_to_argv (args)
     &gt;    if len (argv) != 0:
     &gt;      raise gdb.GdbError ("hello-world takes no arguments")
     &gt;    print "Hello, World!"
     &gt;HelloWorld ()
     &gt;end
     (gdb) hello-world 42
     hello-world takes no arguments

<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgdb_002eValue_007d-1926"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides values it obtains from the inferior program in
an object of type <code>gdb.Value</code>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses this object
for its internal bookkeeping of the inferior's values, and for
fetching values when necessary.

   <p>Inferior values that are simple scalars can be used directly in
Python expressions that are valid for the value's data type.  Here's
an example for an integer or floating-point value <code>some_val</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     bar = some_val + 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As result of this, <code>bar</code> will also be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object
whose values are of the same type as those of <code>some_val</code>.  Valid
Python operations can also be performed on <code>gdb.Value</code> objects
representing a <code>struct</code> or <code>class</code> object.  For such cases,
the overloaded operator (if present), is used to perform the operation. 
For example, if <code>val1</code> and <code>val2</code> are <code>gdb.Value</code> objects
representing instances of a <code>class</code> which overloads the <code>+</code>
operator, then one can use the <code>+</code> operator in their Python script
as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     val3 = val1 + val2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The result of the operation <code>val3</code> is also a <code>gdb.Value</code>
object corresponding to the value returned by the overloaded <code>+</code>
operator.  In general, overloaded operators are invoked for the
following operations: <code>+</code> (binary addition), <code>-</code> (binary
subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication), <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>,
<code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>.

   <p>Inferior values that are structures or instances of some class can
be accessed using the Python <dfn>dictionary syntax</dfn>.  For example, if
<code>some_val</code> is a <code>gdb.Value</code> instance holding a structure, you
can access its <code>foo</code> element with:

<pre class="smallexample">     bar = some_val['foo']
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-getting-structure-elements-using-gdb_002eField-objects-as-subscripts-1927"></a>Again, <code>bar</code> will also be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object.  Structure
elements can also be accessed by using <code>gdb.Field</code> objects as
subscripts (see <a href="#Types-In-Python">Types In Python</a>, for more information on
<code>gdb.Field</code> objects).  For example, if <code>foo_field</code> is a
<code>gdb.Field</code> object corresponding to element <code>foo</code> of the above
structure, then <code>bar</code> can also be accessed as follows:

   <p>A <code>gdb.Value</code> that represents a function can be executed via
inferior function call.  Any arguments provided to the call must match
the function's prototype, and must be provided in the order specified
by that prototype.

   <p>For example, <code>some_val</code> is a <code>gdb.Value</code> instance
representing a function that takes two integers as arguments.  To
execute this function, call it like so:

<pre class="smallexample">     result = some_val (10,20)
</pre>
   <p>Any values returned from a function call will be stored as a
<code>gdb.Value</code>.

<blockquote><p>For pointer data types, this method returns a new <code>gdb.Value</code> object
whose contents is the object pointed to by the pointer.  For example, if
<code>foo</code> is a C pointer to an <code>int</code>, declared in your C program as

     <pre class="smallexample">          int *foo;
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">then you can use the corresponding <code>gdb.Value</code> to access what
<code>foo</code> points to like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          bar = foo.dereference ()
</pre>
        <p>The result <code>bar</code> will be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object holding the
value pointed to by <code>foo</code>.

        <p>A similar function <code>Value.referenced_value</code> exists which also
returns <code>gdb.Value</code> objects corresonding to the values pointed to
by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
values).  However, the behavior of <code>Value.dereference</code>
differs from <code>Value.referenced_value</code> by the fact that the
behavior of <code>Value.dereference</code> is identical to applying the C
unary operator <code>*</code> on a given value.  For example, consider a
reference to a pointer <code>ptrref</code>, declared in your C<tt>++</tt> program
as

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int *intptr;
          ...
          int val = 10;
          intptr ptr = &amp;val;
          intptr &amp;ptrref = ptr;
</pre>
        <p>Though <code>ptrref</code> is a reference value, one can apply the method
<code>Value.dereference</code> to the <code>gdb.Value</code> object corresponding
to it and obtain a <code>gdb.Value</code> which is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>.  However, if you apply the method
<code>Value.referenced_value</code>, the result would be a <code>gdb.Value</code>
object identical to that corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          py_ptrref = gdb.parse_and_eval ("ptrref")
          py_val = py_ptrref.dereference ()
          py_ptr = py_ptrref.referenced_value ()
</pre>
        <p>The <code>gdb.Value</code> object <code>py_val</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>, and <code>py_ptr</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.  In general, <code>Value.dereference</code> can
be applied whenever the C unary operator <code>*</code> can be applied
to the corresponding C value.  For those cases where applying both
<code>Value.dereference</code> and <code>Value.referenced_value</code> is allowed,
the results obtained need not be identical (as we have seen in the above
example).  The results are however identical when applied on
<code>gdb.Value</code> objects corresponding to pointers (<code>gdb.Value</code>

the target type is the type of the return value.  For a complex type,
the target type is the type of the elements.  For a typedef, the
target type is the aliased type.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.6 Selecting Pretty-Printers</h5>

<p><a name="index-selecting-python-pretty_002dprinters-2025"></a>
The Python list <code>gdb.pretty_printers</code> contains an array of
functions or callable objects that have been registered via addition
as a pretty-printer.  Printers in this list are called <code>global</code>
printers, they're available when debugging all inferiors. 
Each <code>gdb.Progspace</code> contains a <code>pretty_printers</code> attribute. 
Each <code>gdb.Objfile</code> also contains a <code>pretty_printers</code>
attribute.

   <p>Each function on these lists is passed a single <code>gdb.Value</code>
argument and should return a pretty-printer object conforming to the
interface definition above (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>).  If a function
cannot create a pretty-printer for the value, it should return
<code>None</code>.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> first checks the <code>pretty_printers</code> attribute of each
<code>gdb.Objfile</code> in the current program space and iteratively calls
each enabled lookup routine in the list for that <code>gdb.Objfile</code>
until it receives a pretty-printer object. 
If no pretty-printer is found in the objfile lists, <span class="sc">gdb</span> then
searches the pretty-printer list of the current program space,
calling each enabled function until an object is returned. 
After these lists have been exhausted, it tries the global
<code>gdb.pretty_printers</code> list, again calling each enabled function until an
object is returned.

   <p>The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list,
and iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a printer
object is returned.

   <p>For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work. 
For example, the underlying data structure may have changed and
the pretty-printer is out of date.

   <p>The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides support for enabling and disabling individual
printers.  For example, if <code>print frame-arguments</code> is on,
a backtrace can become highly illegible if any argument is printed
with a broken printer.

   <p>Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled by attaching an <code>enabled</code>
attribute to the registered function or callable object.  If this attribute
is present and its value is <code>False</code>, the printer is disabled, otherwise
the printer is enabled.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.7 Writing a Pretty-Printer</h5>

<p><a name="index-writing-a-pretty_002dprinter-2026"></a>
A pretty-printer consists of two parts: a lookup function to detect
if the type is supported, and the printer itself.

   <p>Here is an example showing how a <code>std::string</code> printer might be
written.  See <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>, for details on the API this class
must provide.

<pre class="smallexample">     class StdStringPrinter(object):
         "Print a std::string"
     
         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val
     
         def to_string(self):
             return self.val['_M_dataplus']['_M_p']
     
         def display_hint(self):
             return 'string'
</pre>
   <p>And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.

<pre class="smallexample">     def str_lookup_function(val):
         lookup_tag = val.type.tag
         if lookup_tag == None:
             return None
         regex = re.compile("^std::basic_string&lt;char,.*&gt;$")
         if regex.match(lookup_tag):
             return StdStringPrinter(val)
         return None
</pre>
   <p>The example lookup function extracts the value's type, and attempts to
match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a printer object.  If not, it
returns <code>None</code>.

   <p>We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Python
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we
further recommend embedding a version number into the package name. 
This practice will enable <span class="sc">gdb</span> to load multiple versions of
your pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have
different names.

   <p>You should write auto-loaded code (see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>) such that it
can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.  An
ideal auto-load file will consist solely of <code>import</code>s of your
printer modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with
the current objfile.

   <p>Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version. 
Embedding a version number in the Python package name will ensure that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously. 
Then, because the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and
because your auto-loaded code took care to register your library's
printers with a specific objfile, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will find the correct
printers for the specific version of the library used by each
inferior.

   <p>To continue the <code>std::string</code> example (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>),
this code might appear in <code>gdb.libstdcxx.v6</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     def register_printers(objfile):
         objfile.pretty_printers.append(str_lookup_function)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     import gdb.libstdcxx.v6
     gdb.libstdcxx.v6.register_printers(gdb.current_objfile())
</pre>
   <p>The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer. 
There are a few things that can be improved on. 
The printer doesn't have a name, making it hard to identify in a
list of installed printers.  The lookup function has a name, but
lookup functions can have arbitrary, even identical, names.

   <p>Second, the printer only handles one type, whereas a library typically has
several types.  One could install a lookup function for each desired type
in the library, but one could also have a single lookup function recognize
several types.  The latter is the conventional way this is handled. 
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<dfn>subprinters</dfn> are the printers for the individual data types.

   <p>The <code>gdb.printing</code> module provides a formal way of solving these
problems (see <a href="#gdb_002eprinting">gdb.printing</a>). 
Here is another example that handles multiple types.

   <p>These are the types we are going to pretty-print:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct foo { int a, b; };
     struct bar { struct foo x, y; };
</pre>
   <p>Here are the printers:

<pre class="smallexample">     class fooPrinter:
         """Print a foo object."""
     
         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val
     
         def to_string(self):
             return ("a=&lt;" + str(self.val["a"]) +
                     "&gt; b=&lt;" + str(self.val["b"]) + "&gt;")
     
     class barPrinter:
         """Print a bar object."""
     
         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val
     
         def to_string(self):
             return ("x=&lt;" + str(self.val["x"]) +
                     "&gt; y=&lt;" + str(self.val["y"]) + "&gt;")
</pre>
   <p>This example doesn't need a lookup function, that is handled by the
<code>gdb.printing</code> module.  Instead a function is provided to build up
the object that handles the lookup.

<pre class="smallexample">     import gdb.printing
     
     def build_pretty_printer():
         pp = gdb.printing.RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter(
             "my_library")
         pp.add_printer('foo', '^foo$', fooPrinter)
         pp.add_printer('bar', '^bar$', barPrinter)
         return pp
</pre>
   <p>And here is the autoload support:

<pre class="smallexample">     import gdb.printing
     import my_library
     gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(
         gdb.current_objfile(),
         my_library.build_pretty_printer())
</pre>
   <p>Finally, when this printer is loaded into <span class="sc">gdb</span>, here is the
corresponding output of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info pretty-printer</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info pretty-printer
     my_library.so:
       my_library
         foo
         bar

This is mainly useful for substituting canonical typedef names for
types.

   <p><a name="index-type-printer-2028"></a>A <dfn>type printer</dfn> is just a Python object conforming to a certain
protocol.  A simple base class implementing the protocol is provided;
see <a href="#gdb_002etypes">gdb.types</a>.  A type printer must supply at least:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Instance Variable of type_printer: <b>enabled</b><var><a name="index-enabled-2029"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A boolean which is True if the printer is enabled, and False
otherwise.  This is manipulated by the <code>enable type-printer</code>
and <code>disable type-printer</code> commands. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Instance Variable of type_printer: <b>name</b><var><a name="index-name-2030"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The name of the type printer.  This must be a string.  This is used by
the <code>enable type-printer</code> and <code>disable type-printer</code>
commands. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Method on type_printer: <b>instantiate</b> (<var>self</var>)<var><a name="index-instantiate-on-type_005fprinter-2031"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is called by <span class="sc">gdb</span> at the start of type-printing.  It is
only called if the type printer is enabled.  This method must return a
new object that supplies a <code>recognize</code> method, as described below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When displaying a type, say via the <code>ptype</code> command, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will compute a list of type recognizers.  This is done by iterating
first over the per-objfile type printers (see <a href="#Objfiles-In-Python">Objfiles In Python</a>),
followed by the per-progspace type printers (see <a href="#Progspaces-In-Python">Progspaces In Python</a>), and finally the global type printers.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will call the <code>instantiate</code> method of each enabled
type printer.  If this method returns <code>None</code>, then the result is
ignored; otherwise, it is appended to the list of recognizers.

   <p>Then, when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is going to display a type name, it iterates
over the list of recognizers.  For each one, it calls the recognition
function, stopping if the function returns a non-<code>None</code> value. 
The recognition function is defined as:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Method on type_recognizer: <b>recognize</b> (<var>self, type</var>)<var><a name="index-recognize-on-type_005frecognizer-2032"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If <var>type</var> is not recognized, return <code>None</code>.  Otherwise,
return a string which is to be printed as the name of <var>type</var>. 
The <var>type</var> argument will be an instance of <code>gdb.Type</code>
(see <a href="#Types-In-Python">Types In Python</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> uses this two-pass approach so that type printers can
efficiently cache information without holding on to it too long.  For
example, it can be convenient to look up type information in a type
printer and hold it for a recognizer's lifetime; if a single pass were
done then type printers would have to make use of the event system in
order to avoid holding information that could become stale as the
inferior changed.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.9 Filtering Frames.</h5>

<p><a name="index-frame-filters-api-2033"></a>
Frame filters are Python objects that manipulate the visibility of a
frame or frames when a backtrace (see <a href="#Backtrace">Backtrace</a>) is printed by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>Only commands that print a backtrace, or, in the case of <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>
commands (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">GDB/MI</a>), those that return a collection of frames
are affected.  The commands that work with frame filters are:

   <p><code>backtrace</code> (see <a href="#backtrace_002dcommand">The backtrace command</a>),
<code>-stack-list-frames</code>
(see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dframes">The -stack-list-frames command</a>),
<code>-stack-list-variables</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dvariables">The -stack-list-variables command</a>), <code>-stack-list-arguments</code>
see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002darguments">The -stack-list-arguments command</a>) and
<code>-stack-list-locals</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dlocals">The -stack-list-locals command</a>).

   <p>A frame filter works by taking an iterator as an argument, applying
actions to the contents of that iterator, and returning another
iterator (or, possibly, the same iterator it was provided in the case
where the filter does not perform any operations).  Typically, frame
filters utilize tools such as the Python's <code>itertools</code> module to
work with and create new iterators from the source iterator. 
Regardless of how a filter chooses to apply actions, it must not alter
the underlying <span class="sc">gdb</span> frame or frames, or attempt to alter the
call-stack within <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This preserves data integrity within
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Frame filters are executed on a priority basis and care
should be taken that some frame filters may have been executed before,
and that some frame filters will be executed after.

   <p>An important consideration when designing frame filters, and well
worth reflecting upon, is that frame filters should avoid unwinding
the call stack if possible.  Some stacks can run very deep, into the
tens of thousands in some cases.  To search every frame when a frame
filter executes may be too expensive at that step.  The frame filter
cannot know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it may have to
iterate through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as
<span class="sc">gdb</span> performs this iteration when it prints the frames.  If
the filter can defer unwinding frames until frame decorators are
executed, after the last filter has executed, it should.  See <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>, for more information on decorators.  Also, there are
examples for both frame decorators and filters in later chapters. 
See <a href="#Writing-a-Frame-Filter">Writing a Frame Filter</a>, for more information.

   <p>The Python dictionary <code>gdb.frame_filters</code> contains key/object
pairings that comprise a frame filter.  Frame filters in this
dictionary are called <code>global</code> frame filters, and they are
available when debugging all inferiors.  These frame filters must
register with the dictionary directly.  In addition to the
<code>global</code> dictionary, there are other dictionaries that are loaded
with different inferiors via auto-loading (see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>).  The two other areas where frame filter dictionaries
can be found are: <code>gdb.Progspace</code> which contains a
<code>frame_filters</code> dictionary attribute, and each <code>gdb.Objfile</code>
object which also contains a <code>frame_filters</code> dictionary
attribute.

   <p>When a command is executed from <span class="sc">gdb</span> that is compatible with
frame filters, <span class="sc">gdb</span> combines the <code>global</code>,
<code>gdb.Progspace</code> and all <code>gdb.Objfile</code> dictionaries currently
loaded.  All of the <code>gdb.Objfile</code> dictionaries are combined, as
several frames, and thus several object files, might be in use. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> then prunes any frame filter whose <code>enabled</code>
attribute is <code>False</code>.  This pruned list is then sorted according
to the <code>priority</code> attribute in each filter.

   <p>Once the dictionaries are combined, pruned and sorted, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
creates an iterator which wraps each frame in the call stack in a
<code>FrameDecorator</code> object, and calls each filter in order.  The
output from the previous filter will always be the input to the next
filter, and so on.

   <p>Frame filters have a mandatory interface which each frame filter must
implement, defined here:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>FrameFilter.filter</b> (<var>iterator</var>)<var><a name="index-FrameFilter_002efilter-2034"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will call this method on a frame filter when it has
reached the order in the priority list for that filter.

        <p>For example, if there are four frame filters:

     <pre class="smallexample">          Name         Priority
          
          Filter1      5
          Filter2      10
          Filter3      100
          Filter4      1
</pre>
        <p>The order that the frame filters will be called is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          Filter3 -&gt; Filter2 -&gt; Filter1 -&gt; Filter4
</pre>
        <p>Note that the output from <code>Filter3</code> is passed to the input of
<code>Filter2</code>, and so on.

        <p>This <code>filter</code> method is passed a Python iterator.  This iterator
contains a sequence of frame decorators that wrap each
<code>gdb.Frame</code>, or a frame decorator that wraps another frame
decorator.  The first filter that is executed in the sequence of frame
filters will receive an iterator entirely comprised of default
<code>FrameDecorator</code> objects.  However, after each frame filter is
executed, the previous frame filter may have wrapped some or all of
the frame decorators with their own frame decorator.  As frame
decorators must also conform to a mandatory interface, these
decorators can be assumed to act in a uniform manner (see <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>).

        <p>This method must return an object conforming to the Python iterator
protocol.  Each item in the iterator must be an object conforming to
the frame decorator interface.  If a frame filter does not wish to
perform any operations on this iterator, it should return that
iterator untouched.

        <p>This method is not optional.  If it does not exist, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
raise and print an error.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.10 Decorating Frames.</h5>

<p><a name="index-frame-decorator-api-2038"></a>
Frame decorators are sister objects to frame filters (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>).  Frame decorators are applied by a frame filter and can
only be used in conjunction with frame filters.

   <p>The purpose of a frame decorator is to customize the printed content
of each <code>gdb.Frame</code> in commands where frame filters are executed. 
This concept is called decorating a frame.  Frame decorators decorate
a <code>gdb.Frame</code> with Python code contained within each API call. 
This separates the actual data contained in a <code>gdb.Frame</code> from
the decorated data produced by a frame decorator.  This abstraction is
necessary to maintain integrity of the data contained in each
<code>gdb.Frame</code>.

   <p>Frame decorators have a mandatory interface, defined below.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> already contains a frame decorator called
<code>FrameDecorator</code>.  This contains substantial amounts of
boilerplate code to decorate the content of a <code>gdb.Frame</code>.  It is
recommended that other frame decorators inherit and extend this
object, and only to override the methods needed.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>FrameDecorator.elided</b> (<var>self</var>)<var><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002eelided-2039"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The <code>elided</code> method groups frames together in a hierarchical
system.  An example would be an interpreter, where multiple low-level
frames make up a single call in the interpreted language.  In this
example, the frame filter would elide the low-level frames and present
a single high-level frame, representing the call in the interpreted
language, to the user.

        <p>The <code>elided</code> function must return an iterable and this iterable
must contain the frames that are being elided wrapped in a suitable
frame decorator.  If no frames are being elided this function may
return an empty iterable, or <code>None</code>.  Elided frames are indented
from normal frames in a <code>CLI</code> backtrace, or in the case of
<code>GDB/MI</code>, are placed in the <code>children</code> field of the eliding
frame.

        <p>It is the frame filter's task to also filter out the elided frames from
the source iterator.  This will avoid printing the frame twice.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.11 Writing a Frame Filter</h5>

<p><a name="index-writing-a-frame-filter-2047"></a>
There are three basic elements that a frame filter must implement: it
must correctly implement the documented interface (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>), it must register itself with <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and finally, it must
decide if it is to work on the data provided by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  In all
cases, whether it works on the iterator or not, each frame filter must
return an iterator.  A bare-bones frame filter follows the pattern in
the following example.

<pre class="smallexample">     import gdb
     
     class FrameFilter():
     
         def __init__(self):
             # Frame filter attribute creation.
             #
             # 'name' is the name of the filter that GDB will display.
             #
             # 'priority' is the priority of the filter relative to other
             # filters.
             #
             # 'enabled' is a boolean that indicates whether this filter is
             # enabled and should be executed.
     
             self.name = "Foo"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True
     
             # Register this frame filter with the global frame_filters
             # dictionary.
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self
     
         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             # Just return the iterator.
             return frame_iter
</pre>
   <p>The frame filter in the example above implements the three
requirements for all frame filters.  It implements the API, self
registers, and makes a decision on the iterator (in this case, it just
returns the iterator untouched).

   <p>The first step is attribute creation and assignment, and as shown in
the comments the filter assigns the following attributes:  <code>name</code>,
<code>priority</code> and whether the filter should be enabled with the
<code>enabled</code> attribute.

   <p>The second step is registering the frame filter with the dictionary or
dictionaries that the frame filter has interest in.  As shown in the
comments, this filter just registers itself with the global dictionary
<code>gdb.frame_filters</code>.  As noted earlier, <code>gdb.frame_filters</code>
is a dictionary that is initialized in the <code>gdb</code> module when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> starts.  What dictionary a filter registers with is an
important consideration.  Generally, if a filter is specific to a set
of code, it should be registered either in the <code>objfile</code> or
<code>progspace</code> dictionaries as they are specific to the program
currently loaded in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  The global dictionary is always
present in <span class="sc">gdb</span> and is never unloaded.  Any filters registered
with the global dictionary will exist until <span class="sc">gdb</span> exits.  To
avoid filters that may conflict, it is generally better to register
frame filters against the dictionaries that more closely align with
the usage of the filter currently in question.  See <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>, for further information on auto-loading Python scripts.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> takes a hands-off approach to frame filter registration,
therefore it is the frame filter's responsibility to ensure
registration has occurred, and that any exceptions are handled
appropriately.  In particular, you may wish to handle exceptions
relating to Python dictionary key uniqueness.  It is mandatory that
the dictionary key is the same as frame filter's <code>name</code>
attribute.  When a user manages frame filters (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-Management">Frame Filter Management</a>), the names <span class="sc">gdb</span> will display are those contained
in the <code>name</code> attribute.

   <p>The final step of this example is the implementation of the
<code>filter</code> method.  As shown in the example comments, we define the
<code>filter</code> method and note that the method must take an iterator,
and also must return an iterator.  In this bare-bones example, the
frame filter is not very useful as it just returns the iterator
untouched.  However this is a valid operation for frame filters that
have the <code>enabled</code> attribute set, but decide not to operate on
any frames.

   <p>In the next example, the frame filter operates on all frames and
utilizes a frame decorator to perform some work on the frames. 
See <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>, for further information on the frame
decorator interface.

   <p>This example works on inlined frames.  It highlights frames which are
inlined by tagging them with an &ldquo;[inlined]&rdquo; tag.  By applying a
frame decorator to all frames with the Python <code>itertools imap</code>
method, the example defers actions to the frame decorator.  Frame
decorators are only processed when <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints the backtrace.

   <p>This introduces a new decision making topic: whether to perform
decision making operations at the filtering step, or at the printing
step.  In this example's approach, it does not perform any filtering
decisions at the filtering step beyond mapping a frame decorator to
each frame.  This allows the actual decision making to be performed
when each frame is printed.  This is an important consideration, and
well worth reflecting upon when designing a frame filter.  An issue
that frame filters should avoid is unwinding the stack if possible. 
Some stacks can run very deep, into the tens of thousands in some
cases.  To search every frame to determine if it is inlined ahead of
time may be too expensive at the filtering step.  The frame filter
cannot know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it would have
to iterate through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as
<span class="sc">gdb</span> performs this iteration when it prints the frames.

   <p>In this example decision making can be deferred to the printing step. 
As each frame is printed, the frame decorator can examine each frame
in turn when <span class="sc">gdb</span> iterates.  From a performance viewpoint,
this is the most appropriate decision to make as it avoids duplicating
the effort that the printing step would undertake anyway.  Also, if
there are many frame filters unwinding the stack during filtering, it
can substantially delay the printing of the backtrace which will
result in large memory usage, and a poor user experience.

<pre class="smallexample">     class InlineFilter():
     
         def __init__(self):
             self.name = "InlinedFrameFilter"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self
     
         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             frame_iter = itertools.imap(InlinedFrameDecorator,
                                         frame_iter)
             return frame_iter
</pre>
   <p>This frame filter is somewhat similar to the earlier example, except
that the <code>filter</code> method applies a frame decorator object called
<code>InlinedFrameDecorator</code> to each element in the iterator.  The
<code>imap</code> Python method is light-weight.  It does not proactively
iterate over the iterator, but rather creates a new iterator which
wraps the existing one.

   <p>Below is the frame decorator for this example.

<pre class="smallexample">     class InlinedFrameDecorator(FrameDecorator):
     
         def __init__(self, fobj):
             super(InlinedFrameDecorator, self).__init__(fobj)
     
         def function(self):
             frame = fobj.inferior_frame()
             name = str(frame.name())
     
             if frame.type() == gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
                 name = name + " [inlined]"
     
             return name
</pre>
   <p>This frame decorator only defines and overrides the <code>function</code>
method.  It lets the supplied <code>FrameDecorator</code>, which is shipped
with <span class="sc">gdb</span>, perform the other work associated with printing
this frame.

   <p>The combination of these two objects create this output from a
backtrace:

<pre class="smallexample">     #0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
     #1  0x00400566 in max [inlined] (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:21
     #2  0x00400566 in main () at inline.c:31
</pre>
   <p>So in the case of this example, a frame decorator is applied to all
frames, regardless of whether they may be inlined or not.  As
<span class="sc">gdb</span> iterates over the iterator produced by the frame filters,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> executes each frame decorator which then makes a decision
on what to print in the <code>function</code> callback.  Using a strategy
like this is a way to defer decisions on the frame content to printing
time.

<h4 class="subheading">Eliding Frames</h4>

<p>It might be that the above example is not desirable for representing
inlined frames, and a hierarchical approach may be preferred.  If we
want to hierarchically represent frames, the <code>elided</code> frame
decorator interface might be preferable.

   <p>This example approaches the issue with the <code>elided</code> method.  This
example is quite long, but very simplistic.  It is out-of-scope for
this section to write a complete example that comprehensively covers
all approaches of finding and printing inlined frames.  However, this
example illustrates the approach an author might use.

   <p>This example comprises of three sections.

<pre class="smallexample">     class InlineFrameFilter():
     
         def __init__(self):
             self.name = "InlinedFrameFilter"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self
     
         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             return ElidingInlineIterator(frame_iter)
</pre>
   <p>This frame filter is very similar to the other examples.  The only
difference is this frame filter is wrapping the iterator provided to
it (<code>frame_iter</code>) with a custom iterator called
<code>ElidingInlineIterator</code>.  This again defers actions to when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> prints the backtrace, as the iterator is not traversed
until printing.

   <p>The iterator for this example is as follows.  It is in this section of
the example where decisions are made on the content of the backtrace.

<pre class="smallexample">     class ElidingInlineIterator:
         def __init__(self, ii):
             self.input_iterator = ii
     
         def __iter__(self):
             return self
     
         def next(self):
             frame = next(self.input_iterator)
     
             if frame.inferior_frame().type() != gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
                 return frame
     
             try:
                 eliding_frame = next(self.input_iterator)
             except StopIteration:
                 return frame
             return ElidingFrameDecorator(eliding_frame, [frame])
</pre>
   <p>This iterator implements the Python iterator protocol.  When the
<code>next</code> function is called (when <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints each frame),
the iterator checks if this frame decorator, <code>frame</code>, is wrapping
an inlined frame.  If it is not, it returns the existing frame decorator
untouched.  If it is wrapping an inlined frame, it assumes that the
inlined frame was contained within the next oldest frame,
<code>eliding_frame</code>, which it fetches.  It then creates and returns a
frame decorator, <code>ElidingFrameDecorator</code>, which contains both the
elided frame, and the eliding frame.

<pre class="smallexample">     class ElidingInlineDecorator(FrameDecorator):
     
         def __init__(self, frame, elided_frames):
             super(ElidingInlineDecorator, self).__init__(frame)
             self.frame = frame
             self.elided_frames = elided_frames
     
         def elided(self):
             return iter(self.elided_frames)
</pre>
   <p>This frame decorator overrides one function and returns the inlined
frame in the <code>elided</code> method.  As before it lets
<code>FrameDecorator</code> do the rest of the work involved in printing
this frame.  This produces the following output.

<pre class="smallexample">     #0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
     #2  0x00400529 in main () at inline.c:25
         #1  0x00400529 in max (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:15
</pre>
   <p>In that output, <code>max</code> which has been inlined into <code>main</code> is
printed hierarchically.  Another approach would be to combine the
<code>function</code> method, and the <code>elided</code> method to both print a
marker in the inlined frame, and also show the hierarchical
relationship.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.12 Unwinding Frames in Python</h5>

<p><a name="index-unwinding-frames-in-Python-2048"></a>
In <span class="sc">gdb</span> terminology &ldquo;unwinding&rdquo; is the process of finding
the previous frame (that is, caller's) from the current one.  An
unwinder has three methods.  The first one checks if it can handle
given frame (&ldquo;sniff&rdquo; it).  For the frames it can sniff an unwinder
provides two additional methods: it can return frame's ID, and it can
fetch registers from the previous frame.  A running <span class="sc">gdb</span>
mantains a list of the unwinders and calls each unwinder's sniffer in
turn until it finds the one that recognizes the current frame.  There
is an API to register an unwinder.

   <p>The unwinders that come with <span class="sc">gdb</span> handle standard frames. 
However, mixed language applications (for example, an application
running Java Virtual Machine) sometimes use frame layouts that cannot
be handled by the <span class="sc">gdb</span> unwinders.  You can write Python code
that can handle such custom frames.

   <p>You implement a frame unwinder in Python as a class with which has two
attributes, <code>name</code> and <code>enabled</code>, with obvious meanings, and
a single method <code>__call__</code>, which examines a given frame and
returns an object (an instance of <code>gdb.UnwindInfo class)</code>
describing it.  If an unwinder does not recognize a frame, it should
return <code>None</code>.  The code in <span class="sc">gdb</span> that enables writing
unwinders in Python uses this object to return frame's ID and previous
frame registers when <span class="sc">gdb</span> core asks for them.

<h4 class="subheading">Unwinder Input</h4>

<p>An object passed to an unwinder (a <code>gdb.PendingFrame</code> instance)
provides a method to read frame's registers:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>PendingFrame.read_register</b> (<var>reg</var>)<var><a name="index-PendingFrame_002eread_005fregister-2049"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This method returns the contents of the register <var>regn</var> in the
frame as a <code>gdb.Value</code> object.  <var>reg</var> can be either a
register number or a register name; the values are platform-specific. 
They are usually found in the corresponding
<samp><var>platform</var><span class="file">-tdep.h</span></samp> file in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source tree. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>It also provides a factory method to create a <code>gdb.UnwindInfo</code>
instance to be returned to <span class="sc">gdb</span>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>PendingFrame.create_unwind_info</b> (<var>frame_id</var>)<var><a name="index-PendingFrame_002ecreate_005funwind_005finfo-2050"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Returns a new <code>gdb.UnwindInfo</code> instance identified by given
<var>frame_id</var>.  The argument is used to build <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s frame ID
using one of functions provided by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  <var>frame_id</var>'s attributes
determine which function will be used, as follows:

          <dl>
<dt><code>sp, pc, special</code><dd><code>frame_id_build_special (</code><var>frame_id</var><code>.sp, </code><var>frame_id</var><code>.pc, </code><var>frame_id</var><code>.special)</code>

          <br><dt><code>sp, pc</code><dd><code>frame_id_build (</code><var>frame_id</var><code>.sp, </code><var>frame_id</var><code>.pc)</code>

          <p>This is the most common case.

          <br><dt><code>sp</code><dd><code>frame_id_build_wild (</code><var>frame_id</var><code>.sp)</code>
</dl>
        The attribute values should be <code>gdb.Value</code>

        </blockquote></div>

<h4 class="subheading">Unwinder Output: UnwindInfo</h4>

<p>Use <code>PendingFrame.create_unwind_info</code> method described above to
create a <code>gdb.UnwindInfo</code> instance.  Use the following method to
specify caller registers that have been saved in this frame:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>gdb.UnwindInfo.add_saved_register</b> (<var>reg, value</var>)<var><a name="index-gdb_002eUnwindInfo_002eadd_005fsaved_005fregister-2051"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>reg</var> identifies the register.  It can be a number or a name, just
as for the <code>PendingFrame.read_register</code> method above. 
<var>value</var> is a register value (a <code>gdb.Value</code> object). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h4 class="subheading">Unwinder Skeleton Code</h4>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> comes with the module containing the base <code>Unwinder</code>
class.  Derive your unwinder class from it and structure the code as
follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     from gdb.unwinders import Unwinder
     
     class FrameId(object):
         def __init__(self, sp, pc):
             self.sp = sp
             self.pc = pc
     
     
     class MyUnwinder(Unwinder):
         def __init__(....):
             supe(MyUnwinder, self).__init___(&lt;expects unwinder name argument&gt;)
     
         def __call__(pending_frame):
             if not &lt;we recognize frame&gt;:
                 return None
             # Create UnwindInfo.  Usually the frame is identified by the stack
             # pointer and the program counter.
             sp = pending_frame.read_register(&lt;SP number&gt;)
             pc = pending_frame.read_register(&lt;PC number&gt;)
             unwind_info = pending_frame.create_unwind_info(FrameId(sp, pc))
     
             # Find the values of the registers in the caller's frame and
             # save them in the result:
             unwind_info.add_saved_register(&lt;register&gt;, &lt;value&gt;)
             ....
     
             # Return the result:
             return unwind_info
     
</pre>
   <h4 class="subheading">Registering a Unwinder</h4>

<p>An object file, a program space, and the <span class="sc">gdb</span> proper can have
unwinders registered with it.

   <p>The <code>gdb.unwinders</code> module provides the function to register a
unwinder:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>gdb.unwinder.register_unwinder</b> (<var>locus, unwinder, replace=False</var>)<var><a name="index-gdb_002eunwinder_002eregister_005funwinder-2052"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>locus</var> is specifies an object file or a program space to which
<var>unwinder</var> is added.  Passing <code>None</code> or <code>gdb</code> adds
<var>unwinder</var> to the <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s global unwinder list.  The newly
added <var>unwinder</var> will be called before any other unwinder from the
same locus.  Two unwinders in the same locus cannot have the same
name.  An attempt to add a unwinder with already existing name raises
an exception unless <var>replace</var> is <code>True</code>, in which case the
old unwinder is deleted. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h4 class="subheading">Unwinder Precedence</h4>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> first calls the unwinders from all the object files in no
particular order, then the unwinders from the current program space,
and finally the unwinders from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.13 Xmethods In Python</h5>

<p><a name="index-xmethods-in-Python-2053"></a>
<dfn>Xmethods</dfn> are additional methods or replacements for existing
methods of a C<tt>++</tt> class.  This feature is useful for those cases
where a method defined in C<tt>++</tt> source code could be inlined or
optimized out by the compiler, making it unavailable to <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
For such cases, one can define an xmethod to serve as a replacement
for the method defined in the C<tt>++</tt> source code.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
then invoke the xmethod, instead of the C<tt>++</tt> method, to
evaluate expressions.  One can also use xmethods when debugging
with core files.  Moreover, when debugging live programs, invoking an
xmethod need not involve running the inferior (which can potentially
perturb its state).  Hence, even if the C<tt>++</tt> method is available, it
is better to use its replacement xmethod if one is defined.

   <p>The xmethods feature in Python is available via the concepts of an
<dfn>xmethod matcher</dfn> and an <dfn>xmethod worker</dfn>.  To
implement an xmethod, one has to implement a matcher and a
corresponding worker for it (more than one worker can be
implemented, each catering to a different overloaded instance of the
method).  Internally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> invokes the <code>match</code> method of a
matcher to match the class type and method name.  On a match, the
<code>match</code> method returns a list of matching <em>worker</em> objects. 
Each worker object typically corresponds to an overloaded instance of
the xmethod.  They implement a <code>get_arg_types</code> method which
returns a sequence of types corresponding to the arguments the xmethod
requires.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses this sequence of types to perform
overload resolution and picks a winning xmethod worker.  A winner
is also selected from among the methods <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds in the
C<tt>++</tt> source code.  Next, the winning xmethod worker and the
winning C<tt>++</tt> method are compared to select an overall winner.  In
case of a tie between a xmethod worker and a C<tt>++</tt> method, the
xmethod worker is selected as the winner.  That is, if a winning
xmethod worker is found to be equivalent to the winning C<tt>++</tt>
method, then the xmethod worker is treated as a replacement for
the C<tt>++</tt> method.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the overall winner to invoke the
method.  If the winning xmethod worker is the overall winner, then
the corresponding xmethod is invoked via the <code>__call__</code> method
of the worker object.

   <p>If one wants to implement an xmethod as a replacement for an
existing C<tt>++</tt> method, then they have to implement an equivalent
xmethod which has exactly the same name and takes arguments of
exactly the same type as the C<tt>++</tt> method.  If the user wants to
invoke the C<tt>++</tt> method even though a replacement xmethod is
available for that method, then they can disable the xmethod.

The <span class="sc">gdb</span> Python API provides classes, interfaces and functions
to implement, register and manipulate xmethods. 
See <a href="#Xmethods-In-Python">Xmethods In Python</a>.

   <p>An xmethod matcher should be an instance of a class derived from
<code>XMethodMatcher</code> defined in the module <code>gdb.xmethod</code>, or an
object with similar interface and attributes.  An instance of
<code>XMethodMatcher</code> has the following attributes:

managed by the matcher.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.15 Writing an Xmethod</h5>

<p><a name="index-writing-xmethods-in-Python-2065"></a>
Implementing xmethods in Python will require implementing xmethod
matchers and xmethod workers (see <a href="#Xmethods-In-Python">Xmethods In Python</a>).  Consider
the following C<tt>++</tt> class:

<pre class="smallexample">     class MyClass
     {
     public:
       MyClass (int a) : a_(a) { }
     
       int geta (void) { return a_; }
       int operator+ (int b);
     
     private:
       int a_;
     };
     
     int
     MyClass::operator+ (int b)
     {
       return a_ + b;
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Let us define two xmethods for the class <code>MyClass</code>, one
replacing the method <code>geta</code>, and another adding an overloaded
flavor of <code>operator+</code> which takes a <code>MyClass</code> argument (the
C<tt>++</tt> code above already has an overloaded <code>operator+</code>
which takes an <code>int</code> argument).  The xmethod matcher can be
defined as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     class MyClass_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, 'geta')
     
         def get_worker(self, method_name):
             if method_name == 'geta':
                 return MyClassWorker_geta()
     
     
     class MyClass_sum(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, 'sum')
     
         def get_worker(self, method_name):
             if method_name == 'operator+':
                 return MyClassWorker_plus()
     
     
     class MyClassMatcher(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, 'MyClassMatcher')
             # List of methods 'managed' by this matcher
             self.methods = [MyClass_geta(), MyClass_sum()]
     
         def match(self, class_type, method_name):
             if class_type.tag != 'MyClass':
                 return None
             workers = []
             for method in self.methods:
                 if method.enabled:
                     worker = method.get_worker(method_name)
                     if worker:
                         workers.append(worker)
     
             return workers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice that the <code>match</code> method of <code>MyClassMatcher</code> returns
a worker object of type <code>MyClassWorker_geta</code> for the <code>geta</code>
method, and a worker object of type <code>MyClassWorker_plus</code> for the
<code>operator+</code> method.  This is done indirectly via helper classes
derived from <code>gdb.xmethod.XMethod</code>.  One does not need to use the
<code>methods</code> attribute in a matcher as it is optional.  However, if a
matcher manages more than one xmethod, it is a good practice to list the
xmethods in the <code>methods</code> attribute of the matcher.  This will then
facilitate enabling and disabling individual xmethods via the
<code>enable/disable</code> commands.  Notice also that a worker object is
returned only if the corresponding entry in the <code>methods</code> attribute
of the matcher is enabled.

   <p>The implementation of the worker classes returned by the matcher setup
above is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     class MyClassWorker_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def get_arg_types(self):
             return None
     
         def get_result_type(self, obj):
             return gdb.lookup_type('int')
     
         def __call__(self, obj):
             return obj['a_']
     
     
     class MyClassWorker_plus(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def get_arg_types(self):
             return gdb.lookup_type('MyClass')
     
         def get_result_type(self, obj):
             return gdb.lookup_type('int')
     
         def __call__(self, obj, other):
             return obj['a_'] + other['a_']
</pre>
   <p>For <span class="sc">gdb</span> to actually lookup a xmethod, it has to be
registered with it.  The matcher defined above is registered with
<span class="sc">gdb</span> globally as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb.xmethod.register_xmethod_matcher(None, MyClassMatcher())
</pre>
   <p>If an object <code>obj</code> of type <code>MyClass</code> is initialized in C<tt>++</tt>
code as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     MyClass obj(5);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then, after loading the Python script defining the xmethod matchers
and workers into <code>GDBN</code>, invoking the method <code>geta</code> or using
the operator <code>+</code> on <code>obj</code> will invoke the xmethods
defined above:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) p obj.geta()
     $1 = 5
     
     (gdb) p obj + obj
     $2 = 10
</pre>
   <p>Consider another example with a C++ template class:

<pre class="smallexample">     template &lt;class T&gt;
     class MyTemplate
     {
     public:
       MyTemplate () : dsize_(10), data_ (new T [10]) { }
       ~MyTemplate () { delete [] data_; }
     
       int footprint (void)
       {
         return sizeof (T) * dsize_ + sizeof (MyTemplate&lt;T&gt;);
       }
     
     private:
       int dsize_;
       T *data_;
     };
</pre>
   <p>Let us implement an xmethod for the above class which serves as a
replacement for the <code>footprint</code> method.  The full code listing
of the xmethod workers and xmethod matchers is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     class MyTemplateWorker_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def __init__(self, class_type):
             self.class_type = class_type
     
         def get_arg_types(self):
             return None
     
         def get_result_type(self):
             return gdb.lookup_type('int')
     
         def __call__(self, obj):
             return (self.class_type.sizeof +
                     obj['dsize_'] *
                     self.class_type.template_argument(0).sizeof)
     
     
     class MyTemplateMatcher_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, 'MyTemplateMatcher')
     
         def match(self, class_type, method_name):
             if (re.match('MyTemplate&lt;[ \t\n]*[_a-zA-Z][ _a-zA-Z0-9]*&gt;',
                          class_type.tag) and
                 method_name == 'footprint'):
                 return MyTemplateWorker_footprint(class_type)
</pre>
   <p>Notice that, in this example, we have not used the <code>methods</code>
attribute of the matcher as the matcher manages only one xmethod.  The
user can enable/disable this xmethod by enabling/disabling the matcher
itself.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.17 Events In Python</h5>

<p><a name="index-inferior-events-in-Python-2081"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a general event facility so that Python code can be
notified of various state changes, particularly changes that occur in
the inferior.

   <p>An <dfn>event</dfn> is just an object that describes some state change.  The
type of the object and its attributes will vary depending on the details
of the change.  All the existing events are described below.

   <p>In order to be notified of an event, you must register an event handler
with an <dfn>event registry</dfn>.  An event registry is an object in the
<code>gdb.events</code> module which dispatches particular events.  A registry
provides methods to register and unregister event handlers:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>EventRegistry.connect</b> (<var>object</var>)<var><a name="index-EventRegistry_002econnect-2082"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Add the given callable <var>object</var> to the registry.  This object will be
called when an event corresponding to this registry occurs. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>EventRegistry.disconnect</b> (<var>object</var>)<var><a name="index-EventRegistry_002edisconnect-2083"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Remove the given <var>object</var> from the registry.  Once removed, the object
will no longer receive notifications of events. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     def exit_handler (event):
         print "event type: exit"
         print "exit code: %d" % (event.exit_code)
     
     gdb.events.exited.connect (exit_handler)
</pre>
   <p>In the above example we connect our handler <code>exit_handler</code> to the
registry <code>events.exited</code>.  Once connected, <code>exit_handler</code> gets
called when the inferior exits.  The argument <dfn>event</dfn> in this example is
of type <code>gdb.ExitedEvent</code>.  As you can see in the example the
<code>ExitedEvent</code> object has an attribute which indicates the exit code of
the inferior.

   <p>The following is a listing of the event registries that are available and
details of the events they emit:

     <dl>
<dt><code>events.cont</code><dd>Emits <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.

     <p>Some events can be thread specific when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is running in non-stop
mode.  When represented in Python, these events all extend
<code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.  Note, this event is not emitted directly; instead,
events which are emitted by this or other modules might extend this event. 
Examples of these events are <code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> and
<code>gdb.ContinueEvent</code>.

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ThreadEvent.inferior_thread</b><var><a name="index-ThreadEvent_002einferior_005fthread-2084"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>In non-stop mode this attribute will be set to the specific thread which was
involved in the emitted event. Otherwise, it will be set to <code>None</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

     <p>Emits <code>gdb.ContinueEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.

     <p>This event indicates that the inferior has been continued after a stop. For
inherited attribute refer to <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code> above.

     <br><dt><code>events.exited</code><dd>Emits <code>events.ExitedEvent</code> which indicates that the inferior has exited. 
<code>events.ExitedEvent</code> has two attributes:

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ExitedEvent.exit_code</b><var><a name="index-ExitedEvent_002eexit_005fcode-2085"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>An integer representing the exit code, if available, which the inferior
has returned.  (The exit code could be unavailable if, for example,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> detaches from the inferior.) If the exit code is unavailable,
the attribute does not exist. 
</p></blockquote></div>

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ExitedEvent</b><var> inferior<a name="index-ExitedEvent-2086"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>A reference to the inferior which triggered the <code>exited</code> event. 
</p></blockquote></div>

     <br><dt><code>events.stop</code><dd>Emits <code>gdb.StopEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.

     <p>Indicates that the inferior has stopped.  All events emitted by this registry
extend StopEvent.  As a child of <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>, <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>
will indicate the stopped thread when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is running in non-stop
mode.  Refer to <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code> above for more details.

     <p>Emits <code>gdb.SignalEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>.

     <p>This event indicates that the inferior or one of its threads has received as
signal.  <code>gdb.SignalEvent</code> has the following attributes:

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>SignalEvent.stop_signal</b><var><a name="index-SignalEvent_002estop_005fsignal-2087"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>A string representing the signal received by the inferior.  A list of possible
signal values can be obtained by running the command <code>info signals</code> in
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> command prompt. 
</p></blockquote></div>

     <p>Also emits  <code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>.

     <p><code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> event indicates that one or more breakpoints have
been hit, and has the following attributes:

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>BreakpointEvent.breakpoints</b><var><a name="index-BreakpointEvent_002ebreakpoints-2088"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>A sequence containing references to all the breakpoints (type
<code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>) that were hit.

</p></blockquote></div>

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>BreakpointEvent.breakpoint</b><var><a name="index-BreakpointEvent_002ebreakpoint-2089"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>A reference to the first breakpoint that was hit. 
This function is maintained for backward compatibility and is now deprecated
in favor of the <code>gdb.BreakpointEvent.breakpoints</code> attribute. 
</p></blockquote></div>

     <br><dt><code>events.new_objfile</code><dd>Emits <code>gdb.NewObjFileEvent</code> which indicates that a new object file has
been loaded by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  <code>gdb.NewObjFileEvent</code> has one attribute:

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>NewObjFileEvent.new_objfile</b><var><a name="index-NewObjFileEvent_002enew_005fobjfile-2090"></a></var><br>

</p></blockquote></div>

     <br><dt><code>events.clear_objfiles</code><dd>Emits <code>gdb.ClearObjFilesEvent</code> which indicates that the list of object
files for a program space has been reset. 
<code>gdb.ClearObjFilesEvent</code> has one attribute:

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ClearObjFilesEvent.progspace</b><var><a name="index-ClearObjFilesEvent_002eprogspace-2091"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>A reference to the program space (<code>gdb.Progspace</code>) whose objfile list has

     <br><dt><code>events.inferior_call_pre</code><dd>Emits <code>gdb.InferiorCallPreEvent</code> which indicates that a function in
the inferior is about to be called.

     <div class="defun">

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.19 Commands In Python</h5>

<p><a name="index-commands-in-python-2112"></a><a name="index-python-commands-2113"></a>You can implement new <span class="sc">gdb</span> CLI commands in Python.  A CLI
command is implemented using an instance of the <code>gdb.Command</code>
class, most commonly using a subclass.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Command.__init__</b> (<var>name, command_class </var><span class="roman">[</span><var>, completer_class </var><span class="roman">[</span><var>, prefix</var><span class="roman">]]</span>)<var><a name="index-Command_002e_005f_005finit_005f_005f-2114"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The object initializer for <code>Command</code> registers the new command
with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This initializer is normally invoked from the
subclass' own <code>__init__</code> method.

        <p><var>name</var> is the name of the command.  If <var>name</var> consists of
multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
commands.  In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist,
an exception is raised.

        <p>There is no support for multi-line commands.

        <p><var>command_class</var> should be one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMMAND_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants
defined below.  This argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to categorize the
new command in the help system.

        <p><var>completer_class</var> is an optional argument.  If given, it should be
one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMPLETE_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants defined below.  This argument
tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to perform completion for this command.  If not
given, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will attempt to complete using the object's
<code>complete</code> method (see below); if no such method is found, an
error will occur when completion is attempted.

        <p><var>prefix</var> is an optional argument.  If <code>True</code>, then the new
command is a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be
registered.

        <p>The help text for the new command is taken from the Python
documentation string for the command's class, if there is one.  If no
documentation string is provided, the default value &ldquo;This command is
not documented.&rdquo; is used. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-don_0027t-repeat-Python-command-2115"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Command.dont_repeat</b> ()<var><a name="index-Command_002edont_005frepeat-2116"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>By default, a <span class="sc">gdb</span> command is repeated when the user enters a
blank line at the command prompt.  A command can suppress this
behavior by invoking the <code>dont_repeat</code> method.  This is similar
to the user command <code>dont-repeat</code>, see <a href="#Define">dont-repeat</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Command.invoke</b> (<var>argument, from_tty</var>)<var><a name="index-Command_002einvoke-2117"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This method is called by <span class="sc">gdb</span> when this command is invoked.

        <p><var>argument</var> is a string.  It is the argument to the command, after
leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped.

        <p><var>from_tty</var> is a boolean argument.  When true, this means that the
command was entered by the user at the terminal; when false it means
that the command came from elsewhere.

        <p>If this method throws an exception, it is turned into a <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>error</code> call.  Otherwise, the return value is ignored.

        <p><a name="index-gdb_002estring_005fto_005fargv-2118"></a>To break <var>argument</var> up into an argv-like string use
<code>gdb.string_to_argv</code>.  This function behaves identically to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>'s internal argument lexer <code>buildargv</code>. 
It is recommended to use this for consistency. 
Arguments are separated by spaces and may be quoted. 
Example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          print gdb.string_to_argv ("1 2\ \\\"3 '4 \"5' \"6 '7\"")
          ['1', '2 "3', '4 "5', "6 '7"]

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Command.complete</b> (<var>text, word</var>)<var><a name="index-Command_002ecomplete-2120"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This method is called by <span class="sc">gdb</span> when the user attempts
completion on this command.  All forms of completion are handled by
this method, that is, the &lt;TAB&gt; and &lt;M-?&gt; key bindings
(see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), and the <code>complete</code> command (see <a href="#Help">complete</a>).

        <p>The arguments <var>text</var> and <var>word</var> are both strings; <var>text</var>
holds the complete command line up to the cursor's location, while
<var>word</var> holds the last word of the command line; this is computed
using a word-breaking heuristic.

        <p>The <code>complete</code> method can return several values:
          <ul>
<li>If the return value is a sequence, the contents of the sequence are
used as the completions.  It is up to <code>complete</code> to ensure that the
contents actually do complete the word.  A zero-length sequence is
allowed, it means that there were no completions available.  Only
string elements of the sequence are used; other elements in the
sequence are ignored.

          <li>If the return value is one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMPLETE_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants defined
below, then the corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span>-internal completion
function is invoked, and its result is used.

          <li>All other results are treated as though there were no available
completions. 
</ul>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When a new command is registered, it must be declared as a member of
some general class of commands.  This is used to classify top-level
commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands are not
listed under their own category but rather that of their top-level
command.  The available classifications are represented by constants
defined in the <code>gdb</code> module:

   <p>A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by

</dl>

   <p>The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Python:

<pre class="smallexample">     class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
       """Greet the whole world."""
     
       def __init__ (self):
         super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)
     
       def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):
         print "Hello, World!"
     
     HelloWorld ()
</pre>
   <p>The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the command with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Depending on how the
Python code is read into <span class="sc">gdb</span>, you may need to import the
<code>gdb</code> module explicitly.

parameter is implemented as an instance of the <code>gdb.Parameter</code>
class.

   <p>Parameters are exposed to the user via the <code>set</code> and
<code>show</code> commands.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

   <p>There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Two examples are: <code>set follow fork</code> and
<code>set charset</code>.  Setting these parameters influences certain
behavior in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Similarly, you can define parameters that
can be used to influence behavior in custom Python scripts and commands.

<div class="defun">

from the subclass' own <code>__init__</code> method.

        <p><var>name</var> is the name of the new parameter.  If <var>name</var> consists
of multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the
<code>set print</code> set of parameters.  If <var>name</var> is
<code>print foo</code>, then <code>print</code> will be searched as the prefix
parameter.  In this case the parameter can subsequently be accessed in
<span class="sc">gdb</span> as <code>set print foo</code>.

        <p>If <var>name</var> consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
can be found, an exception is raised.

   <p>When a new parameter is defined, its type must be specified.  The

in Python.  A convenience function is an instance of a subclass of the
class <code>gdb.Function</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Function.__init__</b> (<var>name</var>)<var><a name="index-Function_002e_005f_005finit_005f_005f-2192"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The initializer for <code>Function</code> registers the new function with
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the function,
a string.  The function will be visible to the user as a convenience
variable of type <code>internal function</code>, whose name is the same as
the given <var>name</var>.

        <p>The documentation for the new function is taken from the documentation
string for the new class. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Function.invoke</b> (<var>*args</var>)<var><a name="index-Function_002einvoke-2193"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When a convenience function is evaluated, its arguments are converted
to instances of <code>gdb.Value</code>, and then the function's
<code>invoke</code> method is called.  Note that <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not
predetermine the arity of convenience functions.  Instead, all
available arguments are passed to <code>invoke</code>, following the
standard Python calling convention.  In particular, a convenience
function can have default values for parameters without ill effect.

        <p>The return value of this method is used as its value in the enclosing
expression.  If an ordinary Python value is returned, it is converted
to a <code>gdb.Value</code> following the usual rules. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following code snippet shows how a trivial convenience function can
be implemented in Python:

<pre class="smallexample">     class Greet (gdb.Function):
       """Return string to greet someone.
     Takes a name as argument."""
     
       def __init__ (self):
         super (Greet, self).__init__ ("greet")
     
       def invoke (self, name):
         return "Hello, %s!" % name.string ()
     
     Greet ()
</pre>
   <p>The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the function with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Depending on how the
Python code is read into <span class="sc">gdb</span>, you may need to import the
<code>gdb</code> module explicitly.

   <p>Now you can use the function in an expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) print $greet("Bob")
     $1 = "Hello, Bob!"
</pre>

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.25 Accessing blocks from Python.</h5>

<p><a name="index-blocks-in-python-2244"></a><a name="index-gdb_002eBlock-2245"></a>
In <span class="sc">gdb</span>, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds
roughly to a scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized
hierarchically, and are represented individually in Python as a
<code>gdb.Block</code>.  Blocks rely on debugging information being
available.

   <p>A frame has a block.  Please see <a href="#Frames-In-Python">Frames In Python</a>, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.

   <p>The outermost block is known as the <dfn>global block</dfn>.  The global
block typically holds public global variables and functions.

   <p>The block nested just inside the global block is the <dfn>static
block</dfn>.  The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and
functions.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a method to get a block's superblock, but there
is currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to
iterate over all the blocks in a symbol table (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Python">Symbol Tables In Python</a>).

   <p>Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:

<pre class="smallexample">     /* This is in the global block.  */
     int global;
     
     /* This is in the static block.  */
     static int file_scope;
     
     /* 'function' is in the global block, and 'argument' is
        in a block nested inside of 'function'.  */
     int function (int argument)
     {
       /* 'local' is in a block inside 'function'.  It may or may
          not be in the same block as 'argument'.  */
       int local;
     
       {
          /* 'inner' is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
             'local'.  */
          int inner;
     
          /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
             a nested block here whose function is 'inline_function'
             and whose superblock is the one holding 'inner'.  */
          inline_function ();
       }
     }
</pre>
   <p>A <code>gdb.Block</code> is iterable.  The iterator returns the symbols
(see <a href="#Symbols-In-Python">Symbols In Python</a>) local to the block.  Python programs
should not assume that a specific block object will always contain a
given symbol, since changes in <span class="sc">gdb</span> features and
infrastructure may cause symbols move across blocks in a symbol
table.

   <p>The following block-related functions are available in the <code>gdb</code>
module:

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002eblock_005ffor_005fpc-2246"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>gdb.block_for_pc</b> (<var>pc</var>)<var><a name="index-gdb_002eblock_005ffor_005fpc-2247"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the innermost <code>gdb.Block</code> containing the given <var>pc</var>
value.  If the block cannot be found for the <var>pc</var> value specified,
the function will return <code>None</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A <code>gdb.Block</code> object has the following methods:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>Block.is_valid</b> ()<var><a name="index-Block_002eis_005fvalid-2248"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Returns <code>True</code> if the <code>gdb.Block</code> object is valid,
<code>False</code> if not.  A block object can become invalid if the block it
refers to doesn't exist anymore in the inferior.  All other
<code>gdb.Block</code> methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at
the time the method is called.  The block's validity is also checked
during iteration over symbols of the block.

<div class="defun">

        <p>For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.28 Manipulating line tables using Python</h5>

<p><a name="index-line-tables-in-python-2335"></a><a name="index-gdb_002eLineTable-2336"></a>
Python code can request and inspect line table information from a
symbol table that is loaded in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  A line table is a
mapping of source lines to their executable locations in memory.  To
acquire the line table information for a particular symbol table, use
the <code>linetable</code> function (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Python">Symbol Tables In Python</a>).

   <p>A <code>gdb.LineTable</code> is iterable.  The iterator returns
<code>LineTableEntry</code> objects that correspond to the source line and
address for each line table entry.  <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects have
the following attributes:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>LineTableEntry.line</b><var><a name="index-LineTableEntry_002eline-2337"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The source line number for this line table entry.  This number
corresponds to the actual line of source.  This attribute is not
writable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>LineTableEntry.pc</b><var><a name="index-LineTableEntry_002epc-2338"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The address that is associated with the line table entry where the
executable code for that source line resides in memory.  This
attribute is not writable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>As there can be multiple addresses for a single source line, you may
receive multiple <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects with matching
<code>line</code> attributes, but with different <code>pc</code> attributes.  The
iterator is sorted in ascending <code>pc</code> order.  Here is a small
example illustrating iterating over a line table.

<pre class="smallexample">     symtab = gdb.selected_frame().find_sal().symtab
     linetable = symtab.linetable()
     for line in linetable:
        print "Line: "+str(line.line)+" Address: "+hex(line.pc)
</pre>
   <p>This will have the following output:

<pre class="smallexample">     Line: 33 Address: 0x4005c8L
     Line: 37 Address: 0x4005caL
     Line: 39 Address: 0x4005d2L
     Line: 40 Address: 0x4005f8L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x4005ffL
     Line: 44 Address: 0x400608L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x40060cL
     Line: 45 Address: 0x400615L
</pre>
   <p>In addition to being able to iterate over a <code>LineTable</code>, it also
has the following direct access methods:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>LineTable.line</b> (<var>line</var>)<var><a name="index-LineTable_002eline-2339"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return a Python <code>Tuple</code> of <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects for any
entries in the line table for the given <var>line</var>, which specifies

<var>line</var>, the Python <code>None</code> is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>LineTable.has_line</b> (<var>line</var>)<var><a name="index-LineTable_002ehas_005fline-2340"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return a Python <code>Boolean</code> indicating whether there is an entry in
the line table for this source line.  Return <code>True</code> if an entry
is found, or <code>False</code> if not.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>LineTable.source_lines</b> ()<var><a name="index-LineTable_002esource_005flines-2341"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return a Python <code>List</code> of the source line numbers in the symbol

naming the location of the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a
watchpoint.  The contents can be any location recognized by the
<code>break</code> command, or in the case of a watchpoint, by the
<code>watch</code> command.  The optional <var>type</var> denotes the breakpoint
to create from the types defined later in this chapter.  This argument
can be either <code>gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT</code> or <code>gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT</code>; it
defaults to <code>gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT</code>.  The optional <var>internal</var>
argument allows the breakpoint to become invisible to the user.  The
breakpoint will neither be reported when created, nor will it be
listed in the output from <code>info breakpoints</code> (but will be listed
with the <code>maint info breakpoints</code> command).  The optional
<var>temporary</var> argument makes the breakpoint a temporary breakpoint. 
Temporary breakpoints are deleted after they have been hit.  Any
further access to the Python breakpoint after it has been hit will
result in a runtime error (as that breakpoint has now been
automatically deleted).  The optional <var>wp_class</var> argument defines
the class of watchpoint to create, if <var>type</var> is

<blockquote><p>The <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code> class can be sub-classed and, in
particular, you may choose to implement the <code>stop</code> method. 
If this method is defined in a sub-class of <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>,
it will be called when the inferior reaches any location of a
breakpoint which instantiates that sub-class.  If the method returns
<code>True</code>, the inferior will be stopped at the location of the
breakpoint, otherwise the inferior will continue.

        <p>If there are multiple breakpoints at the same location with a
<code>stop</code> method, each one will be called regardless of the
return status of the previous.  This ensures that all <code>stop</code>
methods have a chance to execute at that location.  In this scenario
if one of the methods returns <code>True</code> but the others return
<code>False</code>, the inferior will still be stopped.

        <p>You should not alter the execution state of the inferior (i.e., step,
next, etc.), alter the current frame context (i.e., change the current
active frame), or alter, add or delete any breakpoint.  As a general

A finish breakpoint is a temporary breakpoint set at the return address of
a frame, based on the <code>finish</code> command.  <code>gdb.FinishBreakpoint</code>
extends <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>.  The underlying breakpoint will be disabled
and deleted when the execution will run out of the breakpoint scope (i.e. 
<code>Breakpoint.stop</code> or <code>FinishBreakpoint.out_of_scope</code> triggered). 
Finish breakpoints are thread specific and must be create with the right
thread selected.

<p><a name="index-lazy-strings-in-python-2383"></a><a name="index-gdb_002eLazyString-2384"></a>
A <dfn>lazy string</dfn> is a string whose contents is not retrieved or
encoded until it is needed.

   <p>A <code>gdb.LazyString</code> is represented in <span class="sc">gdb</span> as an
<code>address</code> that points to a region of memory, an <code>encoding</code>
that will be used to encode that region of memory, and a <code>length</code>
to delimit the region of memory that represents the string.  The
difference between a <code>gdb.LazyString</code> and a string wrapped within
a <code>gdb.Value</code> is that a <code>gdb.LazyString</code> will be treated
differently by <span class="sc">gdb</span> when printing.  A <code>gdb.LazyString</code> is
retrieved and encoded during printing, while a <code>gdb.Value</code>
wrapping a string is immediately retrieved and encoded on creation.

   <p>A <code>gdb.LazyString</code> object has the following functions:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>LazyString.value</b> ()<var><a name="index-LazyString_002evalue-2385"></a></var><br>

   <p>A <code>gdb.Architecture</code> class has the following methods:

<div class="defun">

specified, then a list of at most <var>count</var> disassembled instructions
whose start address falls in the closed memory address interval from
<var>start_pc</var> to <var>end_pc</var> are returned.  If <var>end_pc</var> is not

<var>end_pc</var> nor <var>count</var> are specified, then a single instruction at
<var>start_pc</var> is returned.  For all of these cases, each element of the
returned list is a Python <code>dict</code> with the following string keys:

<p><a name="index-Python-auto_002dloading-2393"></a>
When a new object file is read (for example, due to the <code>file</code>

<span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for Python support scripts in several ways:
<samp><var>objfile</var><span class="file">-gdb.py</span></samp> and <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section. 
See <a href="#Auto_002dloading-extensions">Auto-loading extensions</a>.

   <p>The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and scripts.

   <p>Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled,
and the list of auto-loaded scripts can be printed.

<code>auto-load safe-path</code> rejection (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading">Auto-loading</a>). 
This is useful because their names are not printed when <span class="sc">gdb</span>
tries to load them and fails.  There may be many of them, and printing
an error message for each one is problematic.

     <p>If <var>regexp</var> is supplied only Python scripts with matching names are printed.

     <p>Example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info auto-load python-scripts

</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>When reading an auto-loaded file or script, <span class="sc">gdb</span> sets the
<dfn>current objfile</dfn>.  This is available via the <code>gdb.current_objfile</code>
function (see <a href="#Objfiles-In-Python">Objfiles In Python</a>).  This can be useful for

<p><a name="index-gdb_002eprompt-2402"></a>
This module provides a method for prompt value-substitution.

     <dl>
<dt><code>substitute_prompt (</code><var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>Return <var>string</var> with escape sequences substituted by values.  Some
escape sequences take arguments.  You can specify arguments inside
&ldquo;{}&rdquo; immediately following the escape sequence.

     <p>The escape sequences you can pass to this function are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>\\</code><dd>Substitute a backslash. 
<br><dt><code>\e</code><dd>Substitute an ESC character. 
<br><dt><code>\f</code><dd>Substitute the selected frame; an argument names a frame parameter. 
<br><dt><code>\n</code><dd>Substitute a newline. 
<br><dt><code>\p</code><dd>Substitute a parameter's value; the argument names the parameter. 
<br><dt><code>\r</code><dd>Substitute a carriage return. 
<br><dt><code>\t</code><dd>Substitute the selected thread; an argument names a thread parameter. 
<br><dt><code>\v</code><dd>Substitute the version of GDB. 
<br><dt><code>\w</code><dd>Substitute the current working directory. 
<br><dt><code>\[</code><dd>Begin a sequence of non-printing characters.  These sequences are
typically used with the ESC character, and are not counted in the string
length.  Example: &ldquo;\[\e[0;34m\](gdb)\[\e[0m\]&rdquo; will return a
blue-colored &ldquo;(gdb)&rdquo; prompt where the length is five. 
<br><dt><code>\]</code><dd>End a sequence of non-printing characters. 
</dl>

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          substitute_prompt (``frame: \f,
                             print arguments: \p{print frame-arguments}'')
</pre>
<p><br>will return the string:<br>


     <pre class="smallexample">          "frame: main, print arguments: scalars"
</pre>
     </dl>

<h4 class="subsection">23.3.1 Guile Introduction</h4>

<p>Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language
and is the GNU project's official extension language.

   <p>Guile support in <span class="sc">gdb</span> follows the Python support in <span class="sc">gdb</span>
reasonably closely, so concepts there should carry over. 
However, some things are done differently where it makes sense.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> requires Guile version 2.0 or greater. 
Older versions are not supported.

   <p><a name="index-guile-scripts-directory-2405"></a>Guile scripts used by <span class="sc">gdb</span> should be installed in
<samp><var>data-directory</var><span class="file">/guile</span></samp>, where <var>data-directory</var> is
the data directory as determined at <span class="sc">gdb</span> startup (see <a href="#Data-Files">Data Files</a>). 
This directory, known as the <dfn>guile directory</dfn>,
is automatically added to the Guile Search Path in order to allow
the Guile interpreter to locate all scripts installed at this location.

<h4 class="subsection">23.3.2 Guile Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-guile-commands-2406"></a><a name="index-commands-to-access-guile-2407"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides two commands for accessing the Guile interpreter:

     
<a name="index-guile_002drepl-2408"></a>
<a name="index-gr-2409"></a>
<dl><dt><code>guile-repl</code><dt><code>gr</code><dd>The <code>guile-repl</code> command can be used to start an interactive
Guile prompt or <dfn>repl</dfn>.  To return to <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
type <kbd>,q</kbd> or the <code>EOF</code> character (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl-D</kbd> on
an empty prompt).  These commands do not take any arguments.

     <p><a name="index-guile-2410"></a><a name="index-gu-2411"></a><br><dt><code>guile </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>scheme-expression</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>gu </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>scheme-expression</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>The <code>guile</code> command can be used to evaluate a Scheme expression.

     <p>If given an argument, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will pass the argument to the Guile
interpreter for evaluation.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) guile (display (+ 20 3)) (newline)
          23
</pre>
     <p>The result of the Scheme expression is displayed using normal Guile rules.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) guile (+ 20 3)
          23
</pre>
     <p>If you do not provide an argument to <code>guile</code>, it will act as a
multi-line command, like <code>define</code>.  In this case, the Guile
script is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the
<code>guile</code> command.  This command list is terminated using a line
containing <code>end</code>.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) guile
          &gt;(display 23)
          &gt;(newline)
          &gt;end
          23
</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>It is also possible to execute a Guile script from the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
interpreter:

     <dl>
<dt><code>source </code><samp><span class="file">script-name</span></samp><dd>The script name must end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.scm</span></samp>&rsquo; and <span class="sc">gdb</span> must be configured
to recognize the script language based on filename extension using
the <code>script-extension</code> setting.  See <a href="#Extending-GDB">Extending GDB</a>.

     <br><dt><code>guile (load "script-name")</code><dd>This method uses the <code>load</code> Guile function. 
It takes a string argument that is the name of the script to load. 
See the Guile documentation for a description of this function. 
(see <a href="guile.html#Loading">Loading</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.3.3.1 Basic Guile</h5>

<p><a name="index-guile-stdout-2414"></a><a name="index-guile-pagination-2415"></a>At startup, <span class="sc">gdb</span> overrides Guile's <code>current-output-port</code> and
<code>current-error-port</code> to print using <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s output-paging streams. 
A Guile program which outputs to one of these streams may have its
output interrupted by the user (see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  In this
situation, a Guile <code>signal</code> exception is thrown with value <code>SIGINT</code>.

   <p>Guile's history mechanism uses the same naming as <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s,
namely the user of dollar-variables (e.g., $1, $2, etc.). 
The results of evaluations in Guile and in GDB are counted separately,
<code>$1</code> in Guile is not the same value as <code>$1</code> in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> is not thread-safe.  If your Guile program uses multiple
threads, you must be careful to only call <span class="sc">gdb</span>-specific
functions in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread.

   <p>Some care must be taken when writing Guile code to run in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Two things are worth noting in particular:

     <ul>
<li><span class="sc">gdb</span> installs handlers for <code>SIGCHLD</code> and <code>SIGINT</code>. 
Guile code must not override these, or even change the options using
<code>sigaction</code>.  If your program changes the handling of these
signals, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will most likely stop working correctly.  Note
that it is unfortunately common for GUI toolkits to install a
<code>SIGCHLD</code> handler.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way on
all platforms.  Your Guile programs should be aware of this and
should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting a
child process. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-guile-gdb-module-2416"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> introduces a new Guile module, named <code>gdb</code>.  All
methods and classes added by <span class="sc">gdb</span> are placed in this module. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> does not automatically <code>import</code> the <code>gdb</code> module,
scripts must do this themselves.  There are various options for how to
import a module, so <span class="sc">gdb</span> leaves the choice of how the <code>gdb</code>
module is imported to the user. 
To simplify interactive use, it is recommended to add one of the following
to your ~/.gdbinit.

<pre class="smallexample">     guile (use-modules (gdb))
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     guile (use-modules ((gdb) #:renamer (symbol-prefix-proc 'gdb:)))
</pre>
   <p>Which one to choose depends on your preference. 
The second one adds <code>gdb:</code> as a prefix to all module functions
and variables.

   <p>The rest of this manual assumes the <code>gdb</code> module has been imported
without any prefix.  See the Guile documentation for <code>use-modules</code>
for more information
(see <a href="guile.html#Using-Guile-Modules">Using Guile Modules</a>).

   <p>Example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
     ERROR: Unbound variable: value-type
     Error while executing Scheme code.
     (gdb) guile (use-modules (gdb))
     (gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
     int
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>(gdb)</code> module provides these basic Guile functions.

When executing the <code>guile</code> command, Guile exceptions
uncaught within the Guile code are translated to calls to the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> error-reporting mechanism.  If the command that called
<code>guile</code> does not handle the error, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
terminate it and report the error according to the setting of
the <code>guile print-stack</code> parameter.

   <p>The <code>guile print-stack</code> parameter has three settings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>none</code><dd>Nothing is printed.

     <br><dt><code>message</code><dd>An error message is printed containing the Guile exception name,
the associated value, and the Guile call stack backtrace at the
point where the exception was raised.  Example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) guile (display foo)
          ERROR: In procedure memoize-variable-access!:
          ERROR: Unbound variable: foo
          Error while executing Scheme code.
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>full</code><dd>In addition to an error message a full backtrace is printed.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> errors that happen in <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands invoked by
Guile code are converted to Guile exceptions.  The type of the
Guile exception depends on the error.

   <p>Guile procedures provided by <span class="sc">gdb</span> can throw the standard
Guile exceptions like <code>wrong-type-arg</code> and <code>out-of-range</code>.

   <p>User interrupt (via <kbd>C-c</kbd> or by typing <kbd>q</kbd> at a pagination
prompt) is translated to a Guile <code>signal</code> exception with value
<code>SIGINT</code>.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> Guile procedures can also throw these exceptions:

     <dl>
<dt><code>gdb:error</code><a name="index-gdb_003aerror-2432"></a><dd>This exception is a catch-all for errors generated from within <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <br><dt><code>gdb:invalid-object</code><a name="index-gdb_003ainvalid_002dobject-2433"></a><dd>This exception is thrown when accessing Guile objects that wrap underlying
<span class="sc">gdb</span> objects have become invalid.  For example, a
<code>&lt;gdb:breakpoint&gt;</code> object becomes invalid if the user deletes it
from the command line.  The object still exists in Guile, but the
object it represents is gone.  Further operations on this breakpoint
will throw this exception.

     <br><dt><code>gdb:memory-error</code><a name="index-gdb_003amemory_002derror-2434"></a><dd>This exception is thrown when an operation tried to access invalid
memory in the inferior.

     <br><dt><code>gdb:pp-type-error</code><a name="index-gdb_003app_002dtype_002derror-2435"></a><dd>This exception is thrown when a Guile pretty-printer passes a bad object

an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses this object
for its internal bookkeeping of the inferior's values, and for
fetching values when necessary.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> does not memoize <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects. 
<code>make-value</code> always returns a fresh object.

   <p>A <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> that represents a function can be executed via
inferior function call with <code>value-call</code>. 
Any arguments provided to the call must match the function's prototype,
and must be provided in the order specified by that prototype.

   <p>For example, <code>some-val</code> is a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> instance
representing a function that takes two integers as arguments.  To
execute this function, call it like so:

<pre class="smallexample">     (define result (value-call some-val 10 20))
</pre>
   <p>Any values returned from a function call are <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects.

   <p>Note: Unlike Python scripting in <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
inferior values that are simple scalars cannot be used directly in
Scheme expressions that are valid for the value's data type. 
For example, <code>(+ (parse-and-eval "int_variable") 2)</code> does not work. 
And inferior values that are structures or instances of some class cannot
be accessed using any special syntax, instead <code>value-field</code> must be used.

   <p>The following value-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module.

an exception is thrown.  Otherwise the type of the result is determined from
<var>value</var> as described below.

        <p>See <a href="#Architectures-In-Guile">Architectures In Guile</a>, for a list of the builtin
types for an architecture.

        <p>Here's how Scheme values are converted when <var>type</var> argument to

          <dl>
<dt>Scheme boolean<dd>A Scheme boolean is converted the boolean type for the current language.

          <br><dt>Scheme integer<dd>A Scheme integer is converted to the first of a C <code>int</code>,
<code>unsigned int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>unsigned long</code>,
<code>long long</code> or <code>unsigned long long</code> type
for the current architecture that can represent the value.

          <p>If the Scheme integer cannot be represented as a target integer
an <code>out-of-range</code> exception is thrown.

          <br><dt>Scheme real<dd>A Scheme real is converted to the C <code>double</code> type for the
current architecture.

          <br><dt>Scheme string<dd>A Scheme string is converted to a string in the current target
language using the current target encoding. 
Characters that cannot be represented in the current target encoding
are replaced with the corresponding escape sequence.  This is Guile's
<code>SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE</code> conversion strategy
(see <a href="guile.html#Strings">Strings</a>).

          <p>Passing <var>type</var> is not supported in this case,
if it is provided a <code>wrong-type-arg</code> exception is thrown.

          <br><dt><code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code><dd>If <var>value</var> is a <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> object (see <a href="#Lazy-Strings-In-Guile">Lazy Strings In Guile</a>), then the <code>lazy-string-&gt;value</code> procedure is called, and
its result is used.

          <p>Passing <var>type</var> is not supported in this case,
if it is provided a <code>wrong-type-arg</code> exception is thrown.

          <br><dt>Scheme bytevector<dd>If <var>value</var> is a Scheme bytevector and <var>type</var> is provided,
<var>value</var> must be the same size, in bytes, of values of type <var>type</var>,

<blockquote><p>For pointer data types, this method returns a new <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object
whose contents is the object pointed to by <var>value</var>.  For example, if
<code>foo</code> is a C pointer to an <code>int</code>, declared in your C program as

     <pre class="smallexample">          int *foo;
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">then you can use the corresponding <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> to access what

     <pre class="smallexample">          (define bar (value-dereference foo))
</pre>
        <p>The result <code>bar</code> will be a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object holding the

        <p>A similar function <code>value-referenced-value</code> exists which also
returns <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects corresonding to the values pointed to
by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
values).  However, the behavior of <code>value-dereference</code>
differs from <code>value-referenced-value</code> by the fact that the
behavior of <code>value-dereference</code> is identical to applying the C
unary operator <code>*</code> on a given value.  For example, consider a
reference to a pointer <code>ptrref</code>, declared in your C<tt>++</tt> program
as

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int *intptr;
          ...
          int val = 10;
          intptr ptr = &amp;val;
          intptr &amp;ptrref = ptr;
</pre>
        <p>Though <code>ptrref</code> is a reference value, one can apply the method
<code>value-dereference</code> to the <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object corresponding
to it and obtain a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> which is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>.  However, if you apply the method
<code>value-referenced-value</code>, the result would be a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
object identical to that corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (define scm-ptrref (parse-and-eval "ptrref"))

</pre>
        <p>The <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object <code>scm-val</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>, and <code>scm-ptr</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.  In general, <code>value-dereference</code> can
be applied whenever the C unary operator <code>*</code> can be applied
to the corresponding C value.  For those cases where applying both
<code>value-dereference</code> and <code>value-referenced-value</code> is allowed,
the results obtained need not be identical (as we have seen in the above
example).  The results are however identical when applied on
<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects corresponding to pointers (<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
objects with type code <code>TYPE_CODE_PTR</code>) in a C/C<tt>++</tt> program.

        <p>Values are interpreted as strings according to the rules of the
current language.  If the optional length argument is given, the
string will be converted to that length, and will include any embedded
zeroes that the string may contain.  Otherwise, for languages
where the string is zero-terminated, the entire string will be
converted.

        <p>For example, in C-like languages, a value is a string if it is a pointer
to or an array of characters or ints of type <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code>,
or <code>char32_t</code>.

        <p>If the optional <var>encoding</var> argument is given, it must be a string
naming the encoding of the string in the <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>, such as
<code>"ascii"</code>, <code>"iso-8859-6"</code> or <code>"utf-8"</code>.  It accepts
the same encodings as the corresponding argument to Guile's
<code>scm_from_stringn</code> function, and the Guile codec machinery will be used
to convert the string.  If <var>encoding</var> is not given, or if
<var>encoding</var> is the empty string, then either the <code>target-charset</code>
(see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>) will be used, or a language-specific encoding
will be used, if the current language is able to supply one.

        <p>The optional <var>errors</var> argument is one of <code>#f</code>, <code>error</code> or
<code>substitute</code>.  <code>error</code> and <code>substitute</code> must be symbols. 
If <var>errors</var> is not specified, or if its value is <code>#f</code>, then the
default conversion strategy is used, which is set with the Scheme function
<code>set-port-conversion-strategy!</code>. 
If the value is <code>'error</code> then an exception is thrown if there is any
conversion error.  If the value is <code>'substitute</code> then any conversion
error is replaced with question marks. 
See <a href="guile.html#Strings">Strings</a>.

<p>The <code>(gdb)</code> module provides several functions for performing
arithmetic on <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects. 
The arithmetic is performed as if it were done by the target,
and therefore has target semantics which are not necessarily
those of Scheme.  For example operations work with a fixed precision,
not the arbitrary precision of Scheme.

   <p>Wherever a function takes an integer or pointer as an operand,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will convert appropriate Scheme values to perform
the operation.

The value must be a string or <code>#f</code> (meaning there is no hint). 
Several values for <var>display-hint</var>
are predefined by <span class="sc">gdb</span>:

               <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">array</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Indicate that the object being printed is &ldquo;array-like&rdquo;.  The CLI

<code>set print array</code>.

               <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">map</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Indicate that the object being printed is &ldquo;map-like&rdquo;, and that the

printer's <code>to-string</code> function returns a Guile string of some
kind, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will call its internal language-specific
string-printing function to format the string.  For the CLI this means
adding quotation marks, possibly escaping some characters, respecting
<code>set print elements</code>, and the like. 
</dl>

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">to-string</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>to-string</var> is either a function of one parameter, the

          <p>When printing from the CLI, if the <code>to-string</code> method exists,
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will prepend its result to the values returned by
<code>children</code>.  Exactly how this formatting is done is dependent on
the display hint, and may change as more hints are added.  Also,
depending on the print settings (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>), the CLI may
print just the result of <code>to-string</code> in a stack trace, omitting
the result of <code>children</code>.

          <p>If this method returns a string, it is printed verbatim.

          <p>Otherwise, if this method returns an instance of <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>,
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints this value.  This may result in a call to
another pretty-printer.

the resulting value.  Again, this may result in a call to another
pretty-printer.  Guile scalars (integers, floats, and booleans) and
strings are convertible to <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>; other types are not.

<p><a name="index-selecting-guile-pretty_002dprinters-2560"></a>
There are three sets of pretty-printers that <span class="sc">gdb</span> searches:

     <ul>
<li>Per-objfile list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Objfiles-In-Guile">Objfiles In Guile</a>). 
<li>Per-progspace list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Progspaces-In-Guile">Progspaces In Guile</a>). 
<li>The global list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Guile-Pretty-Printing-API">Guile Pretty Printing API</a>). 
These printers are available when debugging any inferior. 
</ul>

   <p>Pretty-printer lookup is done by passing the value to be printed to the
lookup function of each enabled object in turn. 
Lookup stops when a lookup function returns a non-<code>#f</code> value
or when the list is exhausted. 
Lookup functions must return either a <code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code>
object or <code>#f</code>.  Otherwise an exception is thrown.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> first checks the result of <code>objfile-pretty-printers</code>
of each <code>&lt;gdb:objfile&gt;</code> in the current program space and iteratively
calls each enabled lookup function in the list for that <code>&lt;gdb:objfile&gt;</code>
until a non-<code>#f</code> object is returned. 
If no pretty-printer is found in the objfile lists, <span class="sc">gdb</span> then
searches the result of <code>progspace-pretty-printers</code> of the current
program space, calling each enabled function until a non-<code>#f</code> object
is returned. 
After these lists have been exhausted, it tries the global pretty-printers
list, obtained with <code>pretty-printers</code>, again calling each enabled
function until a non-<code>#f</code> object is returned.

   <p>The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list,
and iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a
<code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code> object is returned.

   <p>For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work. 
For example, the underlying data structure may have changed and
the pretty-printer is out of date.

   <p>The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> provides support for enabling and disabling individual
printers.  For example, if <code>print frame-arguments</code> is on,
a backtrace can become highly illegible if any argument is printed
with a broken printer.

   <p>Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled from Scheme by calling
<code>set-pretty-printer-enabled!</code>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.3.3.10 Writing a Guile Pretty-Printer</h5>

<p><a name="index-writing-a-Guile-pretty_002dprinter-2561"></a>
A pretty-printer consists of two basic parts: a lookup function to determine
if the type is supported, and the printer itself.

   <p>Here is an example showing how a <code>std::string</code> printer might be
written.  See <a href="#Guile-Pretty-Printing-API">Guile Pretty Printing API</a>, for details.

<pre class="smallexample">     (define (make-my-string-printer value)
       "Print a my::string string"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "string"
        (lambda (printer)
          (value-field value "_data"))
        #f))
</pre>
   <p>And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.

<pre class="smallexample">     (define (str-lookup-function pretty-printer value)
       (let ((tag (type-tag (value-type value))))
         (and tag
              (string-prefix? "std::string&lt;" tag)
              (make-my-string-printer value))))
</pre>
   <p>Then to register this printer in the global printer list:

<pre class="smallexample">     (append-pretty-printer!
      (make-pretty-printer "my-string" str-lookup-function))
</pre>
   <p>The example lookup function extracts the value's type, and attempts to
match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a &lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt; object. 
If not, it returns <code>#f</code>.

   <p>We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Guile
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we
further recommend embedding a version number into the package name. 
This practice will enable <span class="sc">gdb</span> to load multiple versions of
your pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have
different names.

   <p>You should write auto-loaded code (see <a href="#Guile-Auto_002dloading">Guile Auto-loading</a>) such that it
can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.  An
ideal auto-load file will consist solely of <code>import</code>s of your
printer modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with
the current objfile.

   <p>Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version. 
Embedding a version number in the Guile package name will ensure that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously. 
Then, because the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and
because your auto-loaded code took care to register your library's
printers with a specific objfile, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will find the correct
printers for the specific version of the library used by each
inferior.

   <p>To continue the <code>my::string</code> example,
this code might appear in <code>(my-project my-library v1)</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (use-modules (gdb))
     (define (register-printers objfile)
       (append-objfile-pretty-printer!
        (make-pretty-printer "my-string" str-lookup-function)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     (use-modules (gdb) (my-project my-library v1))
     (register-printers (current-objfile))
</pre>
   <p>The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer. 
There are a few things that can be improved on. 
The printer only handles one type, whereas a library typically has
several types.  One could install a lookup function for each desired type
in the library, but one could also have a single lookup function recognize
several types.  The latter is the conventional way this is handled. 
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<dfn>subprinters</dfn> are the printers for the individual data types.

   <p>The <code>(gdb printing)</code> module provides a formal way of solving this
problem (see <a href="#Guile-Printing-Module">Guile Printing Module</a>). 
Here is another example that handles multiple types.

   <p>These are the types we are going to pretty-print:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct foo { int a, b; };
     struct bar { struct foo x, y; };
</pre>
   <p>Here are the printers:

<pre class="smallexample">     (define (make-foo-printer value)
       "Print a foo object"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "foo"
        (lambda (printer)
          (format #f "a=&lt;~a&gt; b=&lt;~a&gt;"
                  (value-field value "a") (value-field value "a")))
        #f))
     
     (define (make-bar-printer value)
       "Print a bar object"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "foo"
        (lambda (printer)
          (format #f "x=&lt;~a&gt; y=&lt;~a&gt;"
                  (value-field value "x") (value-field value "y")))
        #f))
</pre>
   <p>This example doesn't need a lookup function, that is handled by the
<code>(gdb printing)</code> module.  Instead a function is provided to build up
the object that handles the lookup.

<pre class="smallexample">     (use-modules (gdb printing))
     
     (define (build-pretty-printer)
       (let ((pp (make-pretty-printer-collection "my-library")))
         (pp-collection-add-tag-printer "foo" make-foo-printer)

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.3.3.11 Commands In Guile</h5>

<p><a name="index-commands-in-guile-2562"></a><a name="index-guile-commands-2563"></a>You can implement new <span class="sc">gdb</span> CLI commands in Guile.  A CLI
command object is created with the <code>make-command</code> Guile function,
and added to <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the <code>register-command!</code> Guile function. 
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the command to <span class="sc">gdb</span> from <code>make-command</code>.

   <p>There is no support for multi-line commands, that is commands that
consist of multiple lines and are terminated with <code>end</code>.

<blockquote>
        <p>The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the command.  If <var>name</var> consists of
multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
commands.  In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist,
an exception is raised.

        <p>The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:command&gt;</code> object representing the command. 
The command is not usable until it has been registered with <span class="sc">gdb</span>
with <code>register-command!</code>.

        <p>The rest of the arguments are optional.

        <p>The argument <var>invoke</var> is a procedure of three arguments: <var>self</var>,
<var>args</var> and <var>from-tty</var>.  The argument <var>self</var> is the
<code>&lt;gdb:command&gt;</code> object representing the command. 
The argument <var>args</var> is a string representing the arguments passed to
the command, after leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped. 
The argument <var>from-tty</var> is a boolean flag and specifies whether the
command should consider itself to have been originated from the user
invoking it interactively.  If this function throws an exception,
it is turned into a <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>error</code> call. 
Otherwise, the return value is ignored.

        <p>The argument <var>command-class</var> is one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMMAND_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants
defined below.  This argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to categorize the
new command in the help system.  The default is <code>COMMAND_NONE</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>completer</var> is either <code>#f</code>, one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMPLETE_</span></samp>&rsquo;
constants defined below, or a procedure, also defined below. 
This argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to perform completion
for this command.  If not provided or if the value is <code>#f</code>,
then no completion is performed on the command.

        <p>The argument <var>prefix</var> is a boolean flag indicating whether the new
command is a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be
registered.

        <p>The argument <var>doc-string</var> is help text for the new command. 
If no documentation string is provided, the default value &ldquo;This command is
not documented.&rdquo; is used.

The argument <var>text</var> holds the complete command line up to the cursor's

the &lt;TAB&gt; and &lt;M-?&gt; key bindings (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>),
and the <code>complete</code> command (see <a href="#Help">complete</a>).

        <p>This procedure can return several kinds of values:

<li>If the return value is a list, the contents of the list are used as the
completions.  It is up to <var>completer</var> to ensure that the

   <p>When a new command is registered, it will have been declared as a member of
some general class of commands.  This is used to classify top-level
commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands are not
listed under their own category but rather that of their top-level
command.  The available classifications are represented by constants
defined in the <code>gdb</code> module:

     <dl>
<dt><code>COMMAND_NONE</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fNONE-2573"></a><dd>The command does not belong to any particular class.  A command in
this category will not be displayed in any of the help categories. 
This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_RUNNING</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fRUNNING-2574"></a><dd>The command is related to running the inferior.  For example,
<code>start</code>, <code>step</code>, and <code>continue</code> are in this category. 
Type <kbd>help running</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of
commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_DATA</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fDATA-2575"></a><dd>The command is related to data or variables.  For example,
<code>call</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>print</code> are in this category.  Type
<kbd>help data</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of commands
in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_STACK</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fSTACK-2576"></a><dd>The command has to do with manipulation of the stack.  For example,
<code>backtrace</code>, <code>frame</code>, and <code>return</code> are in this
category.  Type <kbd>help stack</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a
list of commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_FILES</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fFILES-2577"></a><dd>This class is used for file-related commands.  For example,
<code>file</code>, <code>list</code> and <code>section</code> are in this category. 
Type <kbd>help files</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of
commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_SUPPORT</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fSUPPORT-2578"></a><dd>This should be used for &ldquo;support facilities&rdquo;, generally meaning
things that are useful to the user when interacting with <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
but not related to the state of the inferior.  For example,
<code>help</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>shell</code> are in this category.  Type
<kbd>help support</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of
commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_STATUS</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fSTATUS-2579"></a><dd>The command is an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info</span></samp>&rsquo;-related command, that is, related to the
state of <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself.  For example, <code>info</code>, <code>macro</code>,
and <code>show</code> are in this category.  Type <kbd>help status</kbd> at the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_BREAKPOINTS</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fBREAKPOINTS-2580"></a><dd>The command has to do with breakpoints.  For example, <code>break</code>,
<code>clear</code>, and <code>delete</code> are in this category.  Type <kbd>help
breakpoints</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of commands in
this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_TRACEPOINTS</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fTRACEPOINTS-2581"></a><dd>The command has to do with tracepoints.  For example, <code>trace</code>,
<code>actions</code>, and <code>tfind</code> are in this category.  Type
<kbd>help tracepoints</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of
commands in this category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_USER</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fUSER-2582"></a><dd>The command is a general purpose command for the user, and typically
does not fit in one of the other categories. 
Type <kbd>help user-defined</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see
a list of commands in this category, as well as the list of gdb macros
(see <a href="#Sequences">Sequences</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_OBSCURE</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fOBSCURE-2583"></a><dd>The command is only used in unusual circumstances, or is not of
general interest to users.  For example, <code>checkpoint</code>,
<code>fork</code>, and <code>stop</code> are in this category.  Type <kbd>help
obscure</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of commands in this
category.

     <br><dt><code>COMMAND_MAINTENANCE</code><a name="index-COMMAND_005fMAINTENANCE-2584"></a><dd>The command is only useful to <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintainers.  The
<code>maintenance</code> and <code>flushregs</code> commands are in this category. 
Type <kbd>help internals</kbd> at the <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompt to see a list of
commands in this category. 
</dl>

   <p>A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by
specifying it via an argument at initialization, or by returning it
from the <code>completer</code> procedure.  These predefined completion
constants are all defined in the <code>gdb</code> module:

     <dl>
<dt><code>COMPLETE_NONE</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fNONE-2585"></a><dd>This constant means that no completion should be done.

     <br><dt><code>COMPLETE_FILENAME</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fFILENAME-2586"></a><dd>This constant means that filename completion should be performed.

     <br><dt><code>COMPLETE_LOCATION</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fLOCATION-2587"></a><dd>This constant means that location completion should be done. 
See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.

     <br><dt><code>COMPLETE_COMMAND</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fCOMMAND-2588"></a><dd>This constant means that completion should examine <span class="sc">gdb</span>
command names.

     <br><dt><code>COMPLETE_SYMBOL</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fSYMBOL-2589"></a><dd>This constant means that completion should be done using symbol names
as the source.

     <br><dt><code>COMPLETE_EXPRESSION</code><a name="index-COMPLETE_005fEXPRESSION-2590"></a><dd>This constant means that completion should be done on expressions. 
Often this means completing on symbol names, but some language
parsers also have support for completing on field names. 
</dl>

   <p>The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Guile:

<p><a name="index-parameters-in-guile-2591"></a><a name="index-guile-parameters-2592"></a><a name="index-Parameter-2593"></a>You can implement new <span class="sc">gdb</span> <dfn>parameters</dfn> using Guile
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-17" name="fnd-17"><sup>17</sup></a>.

   <p>There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Two examples are: <code>set follow-fork</code> and
<code>set charset</code>.  Setting these parameters influences certain
behavior in <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Similarly, you can define parameters that
can be used to influence behavior in custom Guile scripts and commands.

   <p>A new parameter is defined with the <code>make-parameter</code> Guile function,
and added to <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the <code>register-parameter!</code> Guile function. 
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the parameter to <span class="sc">gdb</span> from <code>make-parameter</code>.

   <p>Parameters are exposed to the user via the <code>set</code> and
<code>show</code> commands.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

<blockquote>
        <p>The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the new parameter.  If <var>name</var>
consists of multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the
<code>set print</code> set of parameters.  If <var>name</var> is
<code>print foo</code>, then <code>print</code> will be searched as the prefix
parameter.  In this case the parameter can subsequently be accessed in
<span class="sc">gdb</span> as <code>set print foo</code>. 
If <var>name</var> consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
can be found, an exception is raised.

        <p>The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter. 
The parameter is not usable until it has been registered with <span class="sc">gdb</span>
with <code>register-parameter!</code>.

        <p>The rest of the arguments are optional.

        <p>The argument <var>command-class</var> should be one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">COMMAND_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants
(see <a href="#Commands-In-Guile">Commands In Guile</a>).  This argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> how to
categorize the new parameter in the help system. 
The default is <code>COMMAND_NONE</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>parameter-type</var> should be one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PARAM_</span></samp>&rsquo; constants
defined below.  This argument tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> the type of the new
parameter; this information is used for input validation and
completion.  The default is <code>PARAM_BOOLEAN</code>.

        <p>If <var>parameter-type</var> is <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then
<var>enum-list</var> must be a list of strings.  These strings
represent the possible values for the parameter.

        <p>If <var>parameter-type</var> is not <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then the presence
of <var>enum-list</var> will cause an exception to be thrown.

        <p>The argument <var>set-func</var> is a function of one argument: <var>self</var> which
is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will call this function when a <var>parameter</var>'s value has
been changed via the <code>set</code> API (for example, <kbd>set foo off</kbd>). 
The value of the parameter has already been set to the new value. 
This function must return a string to be displayed to the user. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will add a trailing newline if the string is non-empty. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> generally doesn't print anything when a parameter is set,
thus typically this function should return &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">""</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A non-empty string result should typically be used for displaying warnings
and errors.

        <p>The argument <var>show-func</var> is a function of two arguments: <var>self</var> which
is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter, and
<var>svalue</var> which is the string representation of the current value. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will call this function when a <var>parameter</var>'s
<code>show</code> API has been invoked (for example, <kbd>show foo</kbd>). 
This function must return a string, and will be displayed to the user. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will add a trailing newline.

        <p>The argument <var>doc</var> is the help text for the new parameter. 
If there is no documentation string, a default value is used.

        <p>The argument <var>set-doc</var> is the help text for this parameter's
<code>set</code> command.

        <p>The argument <var>show-doc</var> is the help text for this parameter's
<code>show</code> command.

        <p>The argument <var>initial-value</var> specifies the initial value of the parameter. 
If it is a function, it takes one parameter, the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code>
object and its result is used as the initial value of the parameter. 
The initial value must be valid for the parameter type,
otherwise an exception is thrown.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.3.3.16 Accessing blocks from Guile.</h5>

<p><a name="index-blocks-in-guile-2649"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cgdb_003ablock_003e-2650"></a>
In <span class="sc">gdb</span>, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds
roughly to a scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized
hierarchically, and are represented individually in Guile as an object
of type <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code>.  Blocks rely on debugging information being
available.

   <p>A frame has a block.  Please see <a href="#Frames-In-Guile">Frames In Guile</a>, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.

   <p>The outermost block is known as the <dfn>global block</dfn>.  The global
block typically holds public global variables and functions.

   <p>The block nested just inside the global block is the <dfn>static
block</dfn>.  The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and
functions.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides a method to get a block's superblock, but there
is currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to
iterate over all the blocks in a symbol table (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Guile">Symbol Tables In Guile</a>).

   <p>Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:

<pre class="smallexample">     /* This is in the global block.  */
     int global;
     
     /* This is in the static block.  */
     static int file_scope;
     
     /* 'function' is in the global block, and 'argument' is
        in a block nested inside of 'function'.  */
     int function (int argument)
     {
       /* 'local' is in a block inside 'function'.  It may or may
          not be in the same block as 'argument'.  */
       int local;
     
       {
          /* 'inner' is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
             'local'.  */
          int inner;
     
          /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
             a nested block here whose function is 'inline_function'
             and whose superblock is the one holding 'inner'.  */
          inline_function ();
       }

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.3.3.19 Manipulating breakpoints using Guile</h5>

<p><a name="index-breakpoints-in-guile-2722"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cgdb_003abreakpoint_003e-2723"></a>
Breakpoints in Guile are represented by objects of type
<code>&lt;gdb:breakpoint&gt;</code>.  New breakpoints can be created with the
<code>make-breakpoint</code> Guile function, and then added to <span class="sc">gdb</span> with the
<code>register-breakpoint!</code> Guile function. 
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the breakpoint to <span class="sc">gdb</span> from <code>make-breakpoint</code>.

   <p>Support is also provided to view and manipulate breakpoints created
outside of Guile.

   <p>The following breakpoint-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:

<!-- TODO: line length -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Scheme Procedure: <b>make-breakpoint</b><var> location </var><span class="roman">[</span><var>#:type type</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>#:wp-class wp-class</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>#:internal internal</var><span class="roman">]</span><var><a name="index-make_002dbreakpoint-2724"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create a new breakpoint at <var>location</var>, a string naming the
location of the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a watchpoint. 
The contents can be any location recognized by the <code>break</code> command,
or in the case of a watchpoint, by the <code>watch</code> command.

        <p>The breakpoint is initially marked as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">invalid</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The breakpoint is not usable until it has been registered with <span class="sc">gdb</span>
with <code>register-breakpoint!</code>, at which point it becomes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">valid</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:breakpoint&gt;</code> object representing the breakpoint.

        <p>The optional <var>type</var> denotes the breakpoint to create. 
This argument can be either <code>BP_BREAKPOINT</code> or <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code>,
and defaults to <code>BP_BREAKPOINT</code>.

        <p>The optional <var>wp-class</var> argument defines the class of watchpoint to
create, if <var>type</var> is <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code>.  If a watchpoint class is
not provided, it is assumed to be a <code>WP_WRITE</code> class.

        <p>The optional <var>internal</var> argument allows the breakpoint to become
invisible to the user.  The breakpoint will neither be reported when
registered, nor will it be listed in the output from <code>info breakpoints</code>
(but will be listed with the <code>maint info breakpoints</code> command). 
If an internal flag is not provided, the breakpoint is visible
(non-internal).

        <p>When a watchpoint is created, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will try to create a
hardware assisted watchpoint.  If successful, the type of the watchpoint
is changed from <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code> to <code>BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT</code>
for <code>WP_WRITE</code>, <code>BP_READ_WATCHPOINT</code> for <code>WP_READ</code>,
and <code>BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT</code> for <code>WP_ACCESS</code>. 
If not successful, the type of the watchpoint is left as <code>WP_WATCHPOINT</code>.

        <p>The available types are represented by constants defined in the <code>gdb</code>
module:

          <dl>
<dt><code>BP_BREAKPOINT</code><a name="index-BP_005fBREAKPOINT-2725"></a><dd>Normal code breakpoint.

          <br><dt><code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code><a name="index-BP_005fWATCHPOINT-2726"></a><dd>Watchpoint breakpoint.

This value cannot be specified when creating the breakpoint.

          <br><dt><code>BP_READ_WATCHPOINT</code><a name="index-BP_005fREAD_005fWATCHPOINT-2728"></a><dd>Hardware assisted read watchpoint. 
This value cannot be specified when creating the breakpoint.

          <br><dt><code>BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT</code><a name="index-BP_005fACCESS_005fWATCHPOINT-2729"></a><dd>Hardware assisted access watchpoint. 
This value cannot be specified when creating the breakpoint. 
</dl>

        <p>The available watchpoint types represented by constants are defined in the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:

          <dl>
<dt><code>WP_READ</code><a name="index-WP_005fREAD-2730"></a><dd>Read only watchpoint.

          <br><dt><code>WP_WRITE</code><a name="index-WP_005fWRITE-2731"></a><dd>Write only watchpoint.

A <dfn>lazy string</dfn> is a string whose contents is not retrieved or
encoded until it is needed.

   <p>A <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> is represented in <span class="sc">gdb</span> as an
<code>address</code> that points to a region of memory, an <code>encoding</code>
that will be used to encode that region of memory, and a <code>length</code>
to delimit the region of memory that represents the string.  The
difference between a <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> and a string wrapped within
a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> is that a <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> will be treated
differently by <span class="sc">gdb</span> when printing.  A <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> is
retrieved and encoded during printing, while a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
wrapping a string is immediately retrieved and encoded on creation.

   <p>Combined with Guile's <code>bytevectors</code>, memory ports provide a lot

one can do something like the following.

A simple iterator facility is provided to allow, for example,
iterating over the set of program symbols without having to first
construct a list of all of them.  A useful contribution would be
to add support for SRFI 41 and SRFI 45.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Scheme Procedure: <b>make-iterator</b><var> object progress next!<a name="index-make_002diterator-2813"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A <code>&lt;gdb:iterator&gt;</code> object is constructed with the <code>make-iterator</code>
procedure.  It takes three arguments: the object to be iterated over,
an object to record the progress of the iteration, and a procedure to
return the next element in the iteration, or an implementation chosen value
to denote the end of iteration.

        <p>By convention, end of iteration is marked with <code>(end-of-iteration)</code>,
and may be tested with the <code>end-of-iteration?</code> predicate. 
The result of <code>(end-of-iteration)</code> is chosen so that it is not
otherwise used by the <code>(gdb)</code> module.  If you are using
<code>&lt;gdb:iterator&gt;</code> in your own code it is your responsibility to
maintain this invariant.

        <p>A trivial example for illustration's sake:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (use-modules (gdb iterator))
          (define my-list (list 1 2 3))
          (define iter
            (make-iterator my-list my-list
                           (lambda (iter)
                             (let ((l (iterator-progress iter)))
                               (if (eq? l '())
                                   (end-of-iteration)
                                   (begin
                                     (set-iterator-progress! iter (cdr l))

When a new object file is read (for example, due to the <code>file</code>
command, or because the inferior has loaded a shared library),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for Guile support scripts in two ways:
<samp><var>objfile</var><span class="file">-gdb.scm</span></samp> and the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section. 
See <a href="#Auto_002dloading-extensions">Auto-loading extensions</a>.

   <p>The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and scripts.

   <p>Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled,
and the list of auto-loaded scripts can be printed.

     <p>Also printed is the list of Guile scripts that were mentioned in
the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section and were not found. 
This is useful because their names are not printed when <span class="sc">gdb</span>
tries to load them and fails.  There may be many of them, and printing
an error message for each one is problematic.

     <p>If <var>regexp</var> is supplied only Guile scripts with matching names are printed.

     <p>Example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info auto-load guile-scripts

When a new object file is read, <span class="sc">gdb</span> looks for a file named
<samp><var>objfile</var><span class="file">-gdb.</span><var>ext</var></samp> (we call it <var>script-name</var> below),
where <var>objfile</var> is the object file's name and
where <var>ext</var> is the file extension for the extension language:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><var>objfile</var><span class="file">-gdb.gdb</span></samp><dd>GDB's own command language

<br><dt><samp><var>objfile</var><span class="file">-gdb.scm</span></samp><dd>Guile
</dl>

   <p><var>script-name</var> is formed by ensuring that the file name of <var>objfile</var>
is absolute, following all symlinks, and resolving <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>
components, and appending the <samp><span class="file">-gdb.</span><var>ext</var></samp> suffix. 
If this file exists and is readable, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will evaluate it as a
script in the specified extension language.

   <p>If this file does not exist, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for
<var>script-name</var> file in all of the directories as specified below.

   <p>Note that loading of these files requires an accordingly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).

   <p>For object files using <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp> suffix <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to load first the
scripts normally according to its <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp> filename.  But if no scripts are
found <span class="sc">gdb</span> also tries script filenames matching the object file without
its <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp> suffix.  This <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp> stripping is case insensitive and it
is attempted on any platform.  This makes the script filenames compatible
between Unix and MS-Windows hosts.

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002edebug_005fgdb_005fscripts_007d-section-2845"></a>
For systems using file formats like ELF and COFF,
when <span class="sc">gdb</span> loads a new object file
it will look for a special section named <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code>. 
If this section exists, its contents is a list of null-terminated entries
specifying scripts to load.  Each entry begins with a non-null prefix byte that
specifies the kind of entry, typically the extension language and whether the
script is in a file or inlined in <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code>.

   <p>The following entries are supported:

     <dl>
<dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_FILE = 1</code><br><dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_SCHEME_FILE = 3</code><br><dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_TEXT = 4</code><br><dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_SCHEME_TEXT = 6</code><dd></dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.4.2.1 Script File Entries</h5>

<p>If the entry specifies a file, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for the file first
in the current directory and then along the source search path
(see <a href="#Source-Path">Specifying Source Directories</a>),
except that <samp><span class="file">$cdir</span></samp> is not searched, since the compilation
directory is not relevant to scripts.

   <p>File entries can be placed in section <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> with,
for example, this GCC macro for Python scripts.

<pre class="example">     /* Note: The "MS" section flags are to remove duplicates.  */
     #define DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT(script_name) \
       asm("\
     .pushsection \".debug_gdb_scripts\", \"MS\",@progbits,1\n\
     .byte 1 /* Python */\n\
     .asciz \"" script_name "\"\n\
     .popsection \n\
     ");
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For Guile scripts, replace <code>.byte 1</code> with <code>.byte 3</code>. 
Then one can reference the macro in a header or source file like this:

<pre class="example">     DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT ("my-app-scripts.py")
</pre>
   <p>The script name may include directories if desired.

   <p>Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).

   <p>If the macro invocation is put in a header, any application or library
using this header will get a reference to the specified script,
and with the use of <code>"MS"</code> attributes on the section, the linker
will remove duplicates.

<h5 class="subsubsection">23.4.2.2 Script Text Entries</h5>

<p>Script text entries allow to put the executable script in the entry
itself instead of loading it from a file. 
The first line of the entry, everything after the prefix byte and up to
the first newline (<code>0xa</code>) character, is the script name, and must not
contain any kind of space character, e.g., spaces or tabs. 
The rest of the entry, up to the trailing null byte, is the script to
execute in the specified language.  The name needs to be unique among
all script names, as <span class="sc">gdb</span> executes each script only once based
on its name.

   <p>Here is an example from file <samp><span class="file">py-section-script.c</span></samp> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
testsuite.

<pre class="example">     #include "symcat.h"
     #include "gdb/section-scripts.h"
     asm(
     ".pushsection \".debug_gdb_scripts\", \"MS\",@progbits,1\n"
     ".byte " XSTRING (SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_TEXT) "\n"
     ".ascii \"gdb.inlined-script\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"class test_cmd (gdb.Command):\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"  def __init__ (self):\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"    super (test_cmd, self).__init__ ("
         "\\\"test-cmd\\\", gdb.COMMAND_OBSCURE)\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"  def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"    print (\\\"test-cmd output, arg = %s\\\" % arg)\\n\"\n"
     ".ascii \"test_cmd ()\\n\"\n"
     ".byte 0\n"
     ".popsection\n"
     );
</pre>
   <p>Loading of inlined scripts requires a properly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>). 
The path to specify in <code>auto-load safe-path</code> is the path of the file
containing the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section.

<h4 class="subsection">23.4.3 Which flavor to choose?</h4>

<p>Given the multiple ways of auto-loading extensions, it might not always
be clear which one to choose.  This section provides some guidance.

<p class="noindent">Benefits of the <samp><span class="file">-gdb.</span><var>ext</var></samp> way:

     <ul>
<li>Can be used with file formats that don't support multiple sections.

     <li>Ease of finding scripts for public libraries.

     <p>Scripts specified in the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section are searched for
in the source search path. 
For publicly installed libraries, e.g., <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp>, there typically
isn't a source directory in which to find the script.

     <li>Doesn't require source code additions. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Benefits of the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> way:

     <ul>
<li>Works with static linking.

     <p>Scripts for libraries done the <samp><span class="file">-gdb.</span><var>ext</var></samp> way require an objfile to
trigger their loading.  When an application is statically linked the only

scripts from all the input libraries to the executable's

     <p>Some classes can be entirely inlined, and thus there may not be an associated

cumbersome.  It may be easier to specify the scripts in the
<code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section as relative paths, and add a path to the
top of the source tree to the source search path.

<h3 class="section">23.5 Multiple Extension Languages</h3>

<p>The Guile and Python extension languages do not share any state,
and generally do not interfere with each other. 
There are some things to be aware of, however.

<h4 class="subsection">23.5.1 Python comes first</h4>

<p>Python was <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s first extension language, and to avoid breaking
existing behaviour Python comes first.  This is generally solved by the
&ldquo;first one wins&rdquo; principle.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintains a list of enabled
extension languages, and when it makes a call to an extension language,
(say to pretty-print a value), it tries each in turn until an extension
language indicates it has performed the request (e.g., has returned the
pretty-printed form of a value). 
This extends to errors while performing such requests: If an error happens
while, for example, trying to pretty-print an object then the error is
reported and any following extension languages are not tried.

<h3 class="section">23.6 Creating new spellings of existing commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-aliases-for-commands-2846"></a>
It is often useful to define alternate spellings of existing commands. 
For example, if a new <span class="sc">gdb</span> command defined in Python has
a long name to type, it is handy to have an abbreviated version of it
that involves less typing.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> itself uses aliases.  For example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; is an alias
of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; command even though it is otherwise an ambiguous
abbreviation of other commands like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Aliases are also used to provide shortened or more common versions
of multi-word commands.  For example, <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tty</span></samp>&rsquo; alias of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set inferior-tty</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

   <p>You can define a new alias with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alias</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

     
<a name="index-alias-2847"></a>
<dl><dt><code>alias [-a] [--] </code><var>ALIAS</var><code> = </code><var>COMMAND</var><dd>
</dl>

   <p><var>ALIAS</var> specifies the name of the new alias. 
Each word of <var>ALIAS</var> must consist of letters, numbers, dashes and
underscores.

   <p><var>COMMAND</var> specifies the name of an existing command
that is being aliased.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; option specifies that the new alias is an abbreviation
of the command.  Abbreviations are not shown in command
lists displayed by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">help</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo; option specifies the end of options,
and is useful when <var>ALIAS</var> begins with a dash.

   <p>Here is a simple example showing how to make an abbreviation
of a command so that there is less to type. 
Suppose you were tired of typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">disas</span></samp>&rsquo;, the current
shortest unambiguous abbreviation of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">disassemble</span></samp>&rsquo; command
and you wanted an even shorter version named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">di</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The following will accomplish this.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) alias -a di = disas
</pre>
   <p>Note that aliases are different from user-defined commands. 
With a user-defined command, you also need to write documentation
for it with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">document</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
An alias automatically picks up the documentation of the existing command.

   <p>Here is an example where we make &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">elms</span></samp>&rsquo; an abbreviation of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">elements</span></samp>&rsquo; in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print elements</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
This is to show that you can make an abbreviation of any part
of a command.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) alias -a set print elms = set print elements
     (gdb) alias -a show print elms = show print elements
     (gdb) set p elms 20
     (gdb) show p elms
     Limit on string chars or array elements to print is 200.
</pre>
   <p>Note that if you are defining an alias of a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set</span></samp>&rsquo; command,
and you want to have an alias for the corresponding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show</span></samp>&rsquo;
command, then you need to define the latter separately.

   <p>Unambiguously abbreviated commands are allowed in <var>COMMAND</var> and
<var>ALIAS</var>, just as they are normally.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) alias -a set pr elms = set p ele
</pre>
   <p>Finally, here is an example showing the creation of a one word
alias for a more complex command. 
This creates alias &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spe</span></samp>&rsquo; of the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set print elements</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) alias spe = set print elements
     (gdb) spe 20
</pre>

<h2 class="chapter">24 Command Interpreters</h2>

<p><a name="index-command-interpreters-2848"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> supports multiple command interpreters, and some command
infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch
between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> currently supports two command interpreters, the console
interpreter (sometimes called the command-line interpreter or <span class="sc">cli</span>)
and the machine interface interpreter (or <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>).  This manual
describes both of these interfaces in great detail.

   <p>By default, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will start with the console interpreter. 
However, the user may choose to start <span class="sc">gdb</span> with another
interpreter by specifying the <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--interpreter</span></samp>
startup options.  Defined interpreters include:

     <dl>
<dt><code>console</code><dd><a name="index-console-interpreter-2849"></a>The traditional console or command-line interpreter.  This is the most often
used interpreter with <span class="sc">gdb</span>. With no interpreter specified at runtime,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will use this interpreter.

     <br><dt><code>mi</code><dd><a name="index-mi-interpreter-2850"></a>The newest <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> interface (currently <code>mi2</code>).  Used primarily
by programs wishing to use <span class="sc">gdb</span> as a backend for a debugger GUI
or an IDE.  For more information, see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">The <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Interface</a>.

     <br><dt><code>mi2</code><dd><a name="index-mi2-interpreter-2851"></a>The current <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> interface.

     <br><dt><code>mi1</code><dd><a name="index-mi1-interpreter-2852"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> interface included in <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

   </dl>

   <p><a name="index-invoke-another-interpreter-2853"></a>The interpreter being used by <span class="sc">gdb</span> may not be dynamically
switched at runtime.  Although possible, this could lead to a very
precarious situation.  Consider an IDE using <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>.  If a user
enters the command "interpreter-set console" in a console view,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> would switch to using the console interpreter, rendering
the IDE inoperable!

   <p><a name="index-interpreter_002dexec-2854"></a>Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, you may execute
commands in any interpreter from the current interpreter using the appropriate
command.  If you are running the console interpreter, simply use the
<code>interpreter-exec</code> command:

<pre class="smallexample">     interpreter-exec mi "-data-list-register-names"
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> has a similar command, although it is only available in versions of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> which support <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> version 2 (or greater).

   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal
interface which uses the <code>curses</code> library to show the source
file, the assembly output, the program registers and <span class="sc">gdb</span>
commands in separate text windows.  The TUI mode is supported only
on platforms where a suitable version of the <code>curses</code> library
is available.

   <p>The TUI mode is enabled by default when you invoke <span class="sc">gdb</span> as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb -tui</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You can also switch in and out of TUI mode while <span class="sc">gdb</span> runs by
using various TUI commands and key bindings, such as <samp><span class="command">tui
enable</span></samp> or <kbd>C-x C-a</kbd>.  See <a href="#TUI-Commands">TUI Commands</a>, and
<a href="#TUI-Keys">TUI Key Bindings</a>.

<h3 class="section">25.1 TUI Overview</h3>

<p>In TUI mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can display several text windows:

     <dl>
<dt><em>command</em><dd>This window is the <span class="sc">gdb</span> command window with the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
prompt and the <span class="sc">gdb</span> output.  The <span class="sc">gdb</span> input is still
managed using readline.

     <br><dt><em>source</em><dd>The source window shows the source file of the program.  The current
line and active breakpoints are displayed in this window.

     <br><dt><em>assembly</em><dd>The assembly window shows the disassembly output of the program.

     <br><dt><em>register</em><dd>This window shows the processor registers.  Registers are highlighted
when their values change. 
</dl>

   <p>The source and assembly windows show the current program position
by highlighting the current line and marking it with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; marker. 
Breakpoints are indicated with two markers.  The first marker
indicates the breakpoint type:

     <dl>
<dt><code>B</code><dd>Breakpoint which was hit at least once.

     <br><dt><code>b</code><dd>Breakpoint which was never hit.

     <br><dt><code>H</code><dd>Hardware breakpoint which was hit at least once.

     <br><dt><code>h</code><dd>Hardware breakpoint which was never hit. 
</dl>

   <p>The second marker indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled or not:

     <dl>
<dt><code>+</code><dd>Breakpoint is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-</code><dd>Breakpoint is disabled. 
</dl>

   <p>The source, assembly and register windows are updated when the current
thread changes, when the frame changes, or when the program counter
changes.

   <p>These windows are not all visible at the same time.  The command
window is always visible.  The others can be arranged in several
layouts:

     <ul>
<li>source only,

     <li>assembly only,

     <li>source and assembly,

     <li>source and registers, or

     <li>assembly and registers. 
</ul>

   <p>A status line above the command window shows the following information:

     <dl>
<dt><em>target</em><dd>Indicates the current <span class="sc">gdb</span> target. 
(see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).

     <br><dt><em>process</em><dd>Gives the current process or thread number. 
When no process is being debugged, this field is set to <code>No process</code>.

     <br><dt><em>function</em><dd>Gives the current function name for the selected frame. 
The name is demangled if demangling is turned on (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>). 
When there is no symbol corresponding to the current program counter,
the string <code>??</code> is displayed.

     <br><dt><em>line</em><dd>Indicates the current line number for the selected frame. 
When the current line number is not known, the string <code>??</code> is displayed.

     <br><dt><em>pc</em><dd>Indicates the current program counter address.

<h3 class="section">25.2 TUI Key Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-TUI-key-bindings-2857"></a>
The TUI installs several key bindings in the readline keymaps
(see <a href="#Command-Line-Editing">Command Line Editing</a>). 
The following key bindings are installed for both TUI mode and the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> standard mode.

     
<a name="index-C_002dx-C_002da-2858"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-x C-a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-a-2859"></a><dt><kbd>C-x a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-A-2860"></a><dt><kbd>C-x A</kbd><dd>Enter or leave the TUI mode.  When leaving the TUI mode,
the curses window management stops and <span class="sc">gdb</span> operates using
its standard mode, writing on the terminal directly.  When reentering
the TUI mode, control is given back to the curses windows. 
The screen is then refreshed.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-1-2861"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-x 1</kbd><dd>Use a TUI layout with only one window.  The layout will
either be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">source</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">assembly</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When the TUI mode
is not active, it will switch to the TUI mode.

     <p>Think of this key binding as the Emacs <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> binding.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-2-2862"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-x 2</kbd><dd>Use a TUI layout with at least two windows.  When the current
layout already has two windows, the next layout with two windows is used. 
When a new layout is chosen, one window will always be common to the
previous layout and the new one.

     <p>Think of it as the Emacs <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> binding.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-o-2863"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-x o</kbd><dd>Change the active window.  The TUI associates several key bindings
(like scrolling and arrow keys) with the active window.  This command
gives the focus to the next TUI window.

     <p>Think of it as the Emacs <kbd>C-x o</kbd> binding.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-s-2864"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-x s</kbd><dd>Switch in and out of the TUI SingleKey mode that binds single
keys to <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands (see <a href="#TUI-Single-Key-Mode">TUI Single Key Mode</a>). 
</dl>

   <p>The following key bindings only work in the TUI mode:

     
<a name="index-PgUp-2865"></a>
<dl><dt>&lt;PgUp&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one page up.

     <p><a name="index-PgDn-2866"></a><br><dt>&lt;PgDn&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one page down.

     <p><a name="index-Up-2867"></a><br><dt>&lt;Up&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one line up.

     <p><a name="index-Down-2868"></a><br><dt>&lt;Down&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one line down.

     <p><a name="index-Left-2869"></a><br><dt>&lt;Left&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one column left.

     <p><a name="index-Right-2870"></a><br><dt>&lt;Right&gt;<dd>Scroll the active window one column right.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dL-2871"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-L</kbd><dd>Refresh the screen. 
</dl>

   <p>Because the arrow keys scroll the active window in the TUI mode, they
are not available for their normal use by readline unless the command
window has the focus.  When another window is active, you must use
other readline key bindings such as <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>
and <kbd>C-f</kbd> to control the command window.

switch into this mode, where the following key bindings are used:

<h3 class="section">25.4 TUI-specific Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-TUI-commands-2883"></a>
The TUI has specific commands to control the text windows. 
These commands are always available, even when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is not in
the TUI mode.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is in the standard mode, most
of these commands will automatically switch to the TUI mode.

   <p>Note that if <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s <code>stdout</code> is not connected to a
terminal, or <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been started with the machine interface
interpreter (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">The <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Interface</a>), most of
these commands will fail with an error, because it would not be
possible or desirable to enable curses window management.

<h2 class="chapter">26 Using <span class="sc">gdb</span> under <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs</h2>

<p><a name="index-Emacs-2898"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgnu_007d-Emacs-2899"></a>A special interface allows you to use <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs to view (and
edit) the source files for the program you are debugging with
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>To use this interface, use the command <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> in Emacs.  Give the
executable file you want to debug as an argument.  This command starts
<span class="sc">gdb</span> as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly
created Emacs buffer. 
<!-- (Do not use the @code{-tui} option to run @value{GDBN} from Emacs.) -->

   <p>Running <span class="sc">gdb</span> under Emacs can be just like running <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally except for two
things:

     <ul>
<li>All &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; input and output goes through an Emacs buffer, called
the GUD buffer.

     <p>This applies both to <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands and their output, and to the input
and output done by the program you are debugging.

     <p>This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of previous
commands and input them again; you can even use parts of the output
in this way.

     <p>All the facilities of Emacs' Shell mode are available for interacting
with your program.  In particular, you can send signals the usual
way&mdash;for example, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> for an interrupt, <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> for a
stop.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> displays source code through Emacs.

     <p>Each time <span class="sc">gdb</span> displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the
source file for that frame and puts an arrow (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;) at the
left margin of the current line.  Emacs uses a separate buffer for
source display, and splits the screen to show both your <span class="sc">gdb</span> session
and the source.

     <p>Explicit <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>list</code> or search commands still produce output as
usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs. 
</ul>

   <p>We call this <dfn>text command mode</dfn>.  Emacs 22.1, and later, also uses
a graphical mode, enabled by default, which provides further buffers
that can control the execution and describe the state of your program. 
See <a href="Emacs.html#GDB-Graphical-Interface">GDB Graphical Interface</a>.

   <p>If you specify an absolute file name when prompted for the <kbd>M-x
gdb</kbd> argument, then Emacs sets your current working directory to where
your program resides.  If you only specify the file name, then Emacs
sets your current working directory to the directory associated
with the previous buffer.  In this case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may find your
program by searching your environment's <code>PATH</code> variable, but on
some operating systems it might not find the source.  So, although the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> input and output session proceeds normally, the auxiliary
buffer does not display the current source and line of execution.

   <p>The initial working directory of <span class="sc">gdb</span> is printed on the top
line of the GUD buffer and this serves as a default for the commands
that specify files for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to operate on.  See <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.

   <p>By default, <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> calls the program called <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp>.  If you
need to call <span class="sc">gdb</span> by a different name (for example, if you
keep several configurations around, with different names) you can
customize the Emacs variable <code>gud-gdb-command-name</code> to run the
one you want.

   <p>In the GUD buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in
addition to the standard Shell mode commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h m</kbd><dd>Describe the features of Emacs' GUD Mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd>Execute to another source line, like the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>step</code> command; also
update the display window to show the current file and location.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd><dd>Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function
calls, like the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>next</code> command.  Then update the display window
to show the current file and location.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-i</kbd><dd>Execute one instruction, like the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>stepi</code> command; update
display window accordingly.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd>Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
<code>finish</code> command.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd>Continue execution of your program, like the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>continue</code>
command.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c &lt;</kbd><dd>Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument
(see <a href="Emacs.html#Arguments">Numeric Arguments</a>),
like the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>up</code> command.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c &gt;</kbd><dd>Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument, like the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>down</code> command. 
</dl>

   <p>In any source file, the Emacs command <kbd>C-x &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>gud-break</code>)
tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.

   <p>In text command mode, if you type <kbd>M-x speedbar</kbd>, Emacs displays a
separate frame which shows a backtrace when the GUD buffer is current. 
Move point to any frame in the stack and type &lt;RET&gt; to make it
become the current frame and display the associated source in the
source buffer.  Alternatively, click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> to make the
selected frame become the current one.  In graphical mode, the
speedbar displays watch expressions.

   <p>If you accidentally delete the source-display buffer, an easy way to get
it back is to type the command <code>f</code> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> buffer, to
request a frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates
the source buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current
frame.

   <p>The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers
which are visiting the source files in the usual way.  You can edit
the files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that <span class="sc">gdb</span>
communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers.  If you add or
delete lines from the text, the line numbers that <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows cease
to correspond properly with the code.

   <p>A more detailed description of Emacs' interaction with <span class="sc">gdb</span> is
given in the Emacs manual (see <a href="Emacs.html#Debuggers">Debuggers</a>).

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Function and Purpose</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d_002c-its-purpose-2900"></a><span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> is a line based machine oriented text interface to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and is activated by specifying using the
<samp><span class="option">--interpreter</span></samp> command line option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Mode Options</a>).  It
is specifically intended to support the development of systems which
use the debugger as just one small component of a larger system.

   <p>This chapter is a specification of the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> interface.  It is written
in the form of a reference manual.

   <p>Note that <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> is still under construction, so some of the
features described below are incomplete and subject to change
(see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Development-and-Front-Ends"><span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Development and Front Ends</a>).

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Notation and Terminology</h3>

<p><a name="index-notational-conventions_002c-for-_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d-2901"></a>This chapter uses the following notation:

     <ul>
<li><code>|</code> separates two alternatives.

     <li><code>[ </code><var>something</var><code> ]</code> indicates that <var>something</var> is optional:
it may or may not be given.

<h3 class="section">27.1 <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> General Design</h3>

<p><a name="index-GDB_002fMI-General-Design-2902"></a>
Interaction of a <span class="sc">GDB/MI</span> frontend with <span class="sc">gdb</span> involves three
parts&mdash;commands sent to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, responses to those commands
and notifications.  Each command results in exactly one response,
indicating either successful completion of the command, or an error. 
For the commands that do not resume the target, the response contains the
requested information.  For the commands that resume the target, the
response only indicates whether the target was successfully resumed. 
Notifications is the mechanism for reporting changes in the state of the
target, or in <span class="sc">gdb</span> state, that cannot conveniently be associated with
a command and reported as part of that command response.

   <p>The important examples of notifications are:
     <ul>
<li>Exec notifications.  These are used to report changes in
target state&mdash;when a target is resumed, or stopped.  It would not
be feasible to include this information in response of resuming
commands, because one resume commands can result in multiple events in
different threads.  Also, quite some time may pass before any event
happens in the target, while a frontend needs to know whether the resuming
command itself was successfully executed.

     <li>Console output, and status notifications.  Console output
notifications are used to report output of CLI commands, as well as
diagnostics for other commands.  Status notifications are used to
report the progress of a long-running operation.  Naturally, including
this information in command response would mean no output is produced
until the command is finished, which is undesirable.

     <li>General notifications.  Commands may have various side effects on
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> or target state beyond their official purpose.  For example,
a command may change the selected thread.  Although such changes can
be included in command response, using notification allows for more
orthogonal frontend design.

   </ul>

   <p>There's no guarantee that whenever an MI command reports an error,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> or the target are in any specific state, and especially,
the state is not reverted to the state before the MI command was
processed.  Therefore, whenever an MI command results in an error,
we recommend that the frontend refreshes all the information shown in
the user interface.

<h4 class="subsection">27.1.1 Context management</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">27.1.1.1 Threads and Frames</h5>

<p>In most cases when <span class="sc">gdb</span> accesses the target, this access is
done in context of a specific thread and frame (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>). 
Often, even when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread
be specified.  The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame,
and supplies them to target on each command.  This is convenient,
because a command line user would not want to specify that information
explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with
<span class="sc">gdb</span> via a single terminal, so no confusion is possible as
to what thread and frame are the current ones.

   <p>In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less
useful.  First, a frontend can easily remember this information
itself.  Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window,
each one used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might
want to access additional threads for internal purposes.  This
increases the risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the
frontend may be operating on a wrong one.  Therefore, each MI command
should explicitly specify which thread and frame to operate on.  To
make it possible, each MI command accepts the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--thread</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--frame</span></samp>&rsquo; options, the value to each is <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier
for thread and frame to operate on.

   <p>Usually, each top-level window in a frontend allows the user to select
a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for further
operations.  However, in some cases <span class="sc">gdb</span> may suggest that the
current thread be changed.  For example, when stopping on a breakpoint
it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is hit.  For
another example, if the user issues the CLI &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; command via
the frontend, it is desirable to change the frontend's selected thread to the
one specified by user.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> communicates the suggestion to
change current thread using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=thread-selected</span></samp>&rsquo; notification. 
No such notification is available for the selected frame at the moment.

   <p>Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so
frontends used the <code>-thread-select</code> to execute commands in the
right context.  However, getting this to work right is cumbersome.  The
simplest way is for frontend to emit <code>-thread-select</code> command
before every command.  This doubles the number of commands that need
to be sent.  The alternative approach is to suppress <code>-thread-select</code>
if the selected thread in <span class="sc">gdb</span> is supposed to be identical to the
thread the frontend wants to operate on.  However, getting this
optimization right can be tricky.  In particular, if the frontend
sends several commands to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and one of the commands changes the
selected thread, then the behaviour of subsequent commands will
change.  So, a frontend should either wait for response from such
problematic commands, or explicitly add <code>-thread-select</code> for
all subsequent commands.  No frontend is known to do this exactly
right, so it is suggested to just always pass the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--thread</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--frame</span></samp>&rsquo; options.

<h5 class="subsubsection">27.1.1.2 Language</h5>

<p>The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected. 
By default, the current language (see <a href="#show-language">show language</a>) is used. 
But for commands known to be language-sensitive, it is recommended
to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--language</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  This option takes one argument,
which is the name of the language to use while executing the command. 
For instance:

<pre class="smallexample">     -data-evaluate-expression --language c "sizeof (void*)"
     ^done,value="4"
     (gdb)
</pre>
   <p>The valid language names are the same names accepted by the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set language</span></samp>&rsquo; command (see <a href="#Manually">Manually</a>), excluding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">local</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">unknown</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h4 class="subsection">27.1.2 Asynchronous command execution and non-stop mode</h4>

<p>On some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is capable of processing MI commands
even while the target is running.  This is called <dfn>asynchronous
command execution</dfn> (see <a href="#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>).  The frontend may
specify a preferrence for asynchronous execution using the
<code>-gdb-set mi-async 1</code> command, which should be emitted before
either running the executable or attaching to the target.  After the
frontend has started the executable or attached to the target, it can
find if asynchronous execution is enabled using the
<code>-list-target-features</code> command.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gdb-set mi-async on</code><br><dt><code>-gdb-set mi-async off</code><dd>Set whether MI is in asynchronous mode.

     <p>When <code>off</code>, which is the default, MI execution commands (e.g.,
<code>-exec-continue</code>) are foreground commands, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> waits
for the program to stop before processing further commands.

     <p>When <code>on</code>, MI execution commands are background execution
commands (e.g., <code>-exec-continue</code> becomes the equivalent of the
<code>c&amp;</code> CLI command), and so <span class="sc">gdb</span> is capable of processing
MI commands even while the target is running.

     <br><dt><code>-gdb-show mi-async</code><dd>Show whether MI asynchronous mode is enabled. 
</dl>

   <p>Note: In <span class="sc">gdb</span> version 7.7 and earlier, this option was called
<code>target-async</code> instead of <code>mi-async</code>, and it had the effect
of both putting MI in asynchronous mode and making CLI background
commands possible.  CLI background commands are now always possible
&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; if the target supports them.  The old spelling is
kept as a deprecated alias for backwards compatibility.

   <p>Even if <span class="sc">gdb</span> can accept a command while target is running,
many commands that access the target do not work when the target is
running.  Therefore, asynchronous command execution is most useful
when combined with non-stop mode (see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>).  Then,
it is possible to examine the state of one thread, while other threads
are running.

   <p>When a given thread is running, MI commands that try to access the
target in the context of that thread may not work, or may work only on
some targets.  In particular, commands that try to operate on thread's
stack will not work, on any target.  Commands that read memory, or
modify breakpoints, may work or not work, depending on the target.  Note
that even commands that operate on global state, such as <code>print</code>,
<code>set</code>, and breakpoint commands, still access the target in the
context of a specific thread,  so frontend should try to find a
stopped thread and perform the operation on that thread (using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--thread</span></samp>&rsquo; option).

   <p>Which commands will work in the context of a running thread is
highly target dependent.  However, the two commands
<code>-exec-interrupt</code>, to stop a thread, and <code>-thread-info</code>,
to find the state of a thread, will always work.

<h4 class="subsection">27.1.3 Thread groups</h4>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span> may be used to debug several processes at the same time. 
On some platfroms, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may support debugging of several
hardware systems, each one having several cores with several different
processes running on each core.  This section describes the MI
mechanism to support such debugging scenarios.

   <p>The key observation is that regardless of the structure of the
target, MI can have a global list of threads, because most commands that
accept the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--thread</span></samp>&rsquo; option do not need to know what process that
thread belongs to.  Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce
neither additional &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--process</span></samp>&rsquo; option, nor an notion of the
current process in the MI interface.  The only strictly new feature
that is required is the ability to find how the threads are grouped
into processes.

   <p>To allow the user to discover such grouping, and to support arbitrary
hierarchy of machines/cores/processes, MI introduces the concept of a
<dfn>thread group</dfn>.  Thread group is a collection of threads and other
thread groups.  A thread group always has a string identifier, a type,
and may have additional attributes specific to the type.  A new
command, <code>-list-thread-groups</code>, returns the list of top-level
thread groups, which correspond to processes that <span class="sc">gdb</span> is
debugging at the moment.  By passing an identifier of a thread group
to the <code>-list-thread-groups</code> command, it is possible to obtain
the members of specific thread group.

   <p>To allow the user to easily discover processes, and other objects, he
wishes to debug, a concept of <dfn>available thread group</dfn> is
introduced.  Available thread group is an thread group that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is not debugging, but that can be attached to, using the
<code>-target-attach</code> command.  The list of available top-level thread
groups can be obtained using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-list-thread-groups --available</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
In general, the content of a thread group may be only retrieved only
after attaching to that thread group.

   <p>Thread groups are related to inferiors (see <a href="#Inferiors-and-Programs">Inferiors and Programs</a>).  Each inferior corresponds to a thread group of a special
type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo;, and some additional operations are permitted on
such thread groups.

For the developers convenience CLI commands can be entered directly,
but there may be some unexpected behaviour.  For example, commands
that query the user will behave as if the user replied yes, breakpoint
command lists are not executed and some CLI commands, such as
<code>if</code>, <code>when</code> and <code>define</code>, prompt for further input with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is not valid MI output.

   <p>This feature may be removed at some stage in the future and it is
recommended that front ends use the <code>-interpreter-exec</code> command
(see <a href="#g_t_002dinterpreter_002dexec">-interpreter-exec</a>).

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d-development-2916"></a>
The application which takes the MI output and presents the state of the
program being debugged to the user is called a <dfn>front end</dfn>.

   <p>Although <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> is still incomplete, it is currently being used
by a variety of front ends to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This makes it difficult
to introduce new functionality without breaking existing usage.  This
section tries to minimize the problems by describing how the protocol
might change.

   <p>Some changes in MI need not break a carefully designed front end, and
for these the MI version will remain unchanged.  The following is a
list of changes that may occur within one level, so front ends should
parse MI output in a way that can handle them:

     <ul>
<li>New MI commands may be added.

     <li>New fields may be added to the output of any MI command.

     <li>The range of values for fields with specified values, e.g.,
<code>in_scope</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dupdate">-var-update</a>) may be extended.

     <!-- The format of field's content e.g type prefix, may change so parse it -->
     <!-- at your own risk.  Yes, in general? -->
     <!-- The order of fields may change?  Shouldn't really matter but it might -->
     <!-- resolve inconsistencies. -->
   </ul>

   <p>If the changes are likely to break front ends, the MI version level
will be increased by one.  This will allow the front end to parse the
output according to the MI version.  Apart from mi0, new versions of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will not support old versions of MI and it will be the
responsibility of the front end to work with the new one.

<!-- Starting with mi3, add a new command -mi-version that prints the MI -->
<!-- version? -->
   <p>The best way to avoid unexpected changes in MI that might break your front
end is to make your project known to <span class="sc">gdb</span> developers and
follow development on <a href="mailto:gdb@sourceware.org">gdb@sourceware.org</a> and
<a href="mailto:gdb-patches@sourceware.org">gdb-patches@sourceware.org</a>.

   <p>Each stream record begins with a unique <dfn>prefix character</dfn> which
identifies its stream (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Output-Syntax"><span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Output Syntax</a>).  In addition to the prefix, each stream record contains a
<var>string-output</var>.  This is either raw text (with an implicit new
line) or a quoted C string (which does not contain an implicit newline).

     <dl>
<dt><code>"~" </code><var>string-output</var><dd>The console output stream contains text that should be displayed in the
CLI console window.  It contains the textual responses to CLI commands.

     <br><dt><code>"@" </code><var>string-output</var><dd>The target output stream contains any textual output from the running
target.  This is only present when GDB's event loop is truly
asynchronous, which is currently only the case for remote targets.

     <br><dt><code>"&amp;" </code><var>string-output</var><dd>The log stream contains debugging messages being produced by <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s
internals.

<p><a name="index-async-records-in-_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d-2927"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d_002c-async-records-2928"></a><dfn>Async</dfn> records are used to notify the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> client of
additional changes that have occurred.  Those changes can either be a
consequence of <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of
target activity (e.g., target stopped).

   <p>The following is the list of possible async records:

     <dl>
<dt><code>*running,thread-id="</code><var>thread</var><code>"</code><dd>The target is now running.  The <var>thread</var> field tells which
specific thread is now running, and can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo; if all threads
are running.  The frontend should assume that no interaction with a
running thread is possible after this notification is produced. 
The frontend should not assume that this notification is output
only once for any command.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> may emit this notification
several times, either for different threads, because it cannot resume
all threads together, or even for a single thread, if the thread must
be stepped though some code before letting it run freely.

     <br><dt><code>*stopped,reason="</code><var>reason</var><code>",thread-id="</code><var>id</var><code>",stopped-threads="</code><var>stopped</var><code>",core="</code><var>core</var><code>"</code><dd>The target has stopped.  The <var>reason</var> field can have one of the
following values:

          <dl>
<dt><code>breakpoint-hit</code><dd>A breakpoint was reached. 
<br><dt><code>watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>A watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>read-watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>A read watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>access-watchpoint-trigger</code><dd>An access watchpoint was triggered. 
<br><dt><code>function-finished</code><dd>An -exec-finish or similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>location-reached</code><dd>An -exec-until or similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>watchpoint-scope</code><dd>A watchpoint has gone out of scope. 
<br><dt><code>end-stepping-range</code><dd>An -exec-next, -exec-next-instruction, -exec-step, -exec-step-instruction or
similar CLI command was accomplished. 
<br><dt><code>exited-signalled</code><dd>The inferior exited because of a signal. 
<br><dt><code>exited</code><dd>The inferior exited. 
<br><dt><code>exited-normally</code><dd>The inferior exited normally. 
<br><dt><code>signal-received</code><dd>A signal was received by the inferior. 
<br><dt><code>solib-event</code><dd>The inferior has stopped due to a library being loaded or unloaded. 
This can happen when <code>stop-on-solib-events</code> (see <a href="#Files">Files</a>) is
set or when a <code>catch load</code> or <code>catch unload</code> catchpoint is
in use (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>). 
<br><dt><code>fork</code><dd>The inferior has forked.  This is reported when <code>catch fork</code>
(see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>) has been used. 
<br><dt><code>vfork</code><dd>The inferior has vforked.  This is reported in when <code>catch vfork</code>
(see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>) has been used. 
<br><dt><code>syscall-entry</code><dd>The inferior entered a system call.  This is reported when <code>catch
syscall</code> (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>) has been used. 
<br><dt><code>syscall-return</code><dd>The inferior returned from a system call.  This is reported when
<code>catch syscall</code> (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>) has been used. 
<br><dt><code>exec</code><dd>The inferior called <code>exec</code>.  This is reported when <code>catch exec</code>
(see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>) has been used. 
</dl>

     <p>The <var>id</var> field identifies the thread that directly caused the stop
&ndash; for example by hitting a breakpoint.  Depending on whether all-stop
mode is in effect (see <a href="#All_002dStop-Mode">All-Stop Mode</a>), <span class="sc">gdb</span> may either
stop all threads, or only the thread that directly triggered the stop. 
If all threads are stopped, the <var>stopped</var> field will have the
value of <code>"all"</code>.  Otherwise, the value of the <var>stopped</var>
field will be a list of thread identifiers.  Presently, this list will
always include a single thread, but frontend should be prepared to see
several threads in the list.  The <var>core</var> field reports the
processor core on which the stop event has happened.  This field may be absent
if such information is not available.

     <br><dt><code>=thread-group-added,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dt><code>=thread-group-removed,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dd>A thread group was either added or removed.  The <var>id</var> field
contains the <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the thread group.  When a thread
group is added, it generally might not be associated with a running
process.  When a thread group is removed, its id becomes invalid and
cannot be used in any way.

     <br><dt><code>=thread-group-started,id="</code><var>id</var><code>",pid="</code><var>pid</var><code>"</code><dd>A thread group became associated with a running program,
either because the program was just started or the thread group
was attached to a program.  The <var>id</var> field contains the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the thread group.  The <var>pid</var> field
contains process identifier, specific to the operating system.

     <br><dt><code>=thread-group-exited,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"[,exit-code="</code><var>code</var><code>"]</code><dd>A thread group is no longer associated with a running program,
either because the program has exited, or because it was detached
from.  The <var>id</var> field contains the <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the
thread group.  The <var>code</var> field is the exit code of the inferior; it exists
only when the inferior exited with some code.

     <br><dt><code>=thread-created,id="</code><var>id</var><code>",group-id="</code><var>gid</var><code>"</code><dt><code>=thread-exited,id="</code><var>id</var><code>",group-id="</code><var>gid</var><code>"</code><dd>A thread either was created, or has exited.  The <var>id</var> field
contains the <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the thread.  The <var>gid</var>
field identifies the thread group this thread belongs to.

     <br><dt><code>=thread-selected,id="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dd>Informs that the selected thread was changed as result of the last
command.  This notification is not emitted as result of <code>-thread-select</code>
command but is emitted whenever an MI command that is not documented
to change the selected thread actually changes it.  In particular,
invoking, directly or indirectly (via user-defined command), the CLI
<code>thread</code> command, will generate this notification.

     <p>We suggest that in response to this notification, front ends
highlight the selected thread and cause subsequent commands to apply to
that thread.

     <br><dt><code>=library-loaded,...</code><dd>Reports that a new library file was loaded by the program.  This
notification has 4 fields&mdash;<var>id</var>, <var>target-name</var>,
<var>host-name</var>, and <var>symbols-loaded</var>.  The <var>id</var> field is an
opaque identifier of the library.  For remote debugging case,
<var>target-name</var> and <var>host-name</var> fields give the name of the
library file on the target, and on the host respectively.  For native
debugging, both those fields have the same value.  The
<var>symbols-loaded</var> field is emitted only for backward compatibility
and should not be relied on to convey any useful information.  The
<var>thread-group</var> field, if present, specifies the id of the thread
group in whose context the library was loaded.  If the field is
absent, it means the library was loaded in the context of all present
thread groups.

     <br><dt><code>=library-unloaded,...</code><dd>Reports that a library was unloaded by the program.  This notification
has 3 fields&mdash;<var>id</var>, <var>target-name</var> and <var>host-name</var> with
the same meaning as for the <code>=library-loaded</code> notification. 
The <var>thread-group</var> field, if present, specifies the id of the
thread group in whose context the library was unloaded.  If the field is
absent, it means the library was unloaded in the context of all present
thread groups.

     <br><dt><code>=traceframe-changed,num=</code><var>tfnum</var><code>,tracepoint=</code><var>tpnum</var><dt><code>=traceframe-changed,end</code><dd>Reports that the trace frame was changed and its new number is
<var>tfnum</var>.  The number of the tracepoint associated with this trace
frame is <var>tpnum</var>.

     <br><dt><code>=tsv-created,name=</code><var>name</var><code>,initial=</code><var>initial</var><dd>Reports that the new trace state variable <var>name</var> is created with
initial value <var>initial</var>.

     <br><dt><code>=tsv-deleted,name=</code><var>name</var><dt><code>=tsv-deleted</code><dd>Reports that the trace state variable <var>name</var> is deleted or all
trace state variables are deleted.

     <br><dt><code>=tsv-modified,name=</code><var>name</var><code>,initial=</code><var>initial</var><code>[,current=</code><var>current</var><code>]</code><dd>Reports that the trace state variable <var>name</var> is modified with
the initial value <var>initial</var>. The current value <var>current</var> of
trace state variable is optional and is reported if the current
value of trace state variable is known.

     <br><dt><code>=breakpoint-created,bkpt={...}</code><dt><code>=breakpoint-modified,bkpt={...}</code><dt><code>=breakpoint-deleted,id=</code><var>number</var><dd>Reports that a breakpoint was created, modified, or deleted,
respectively.  Only user-visible breakpoints are reported to the MI
user.

     <p>The <var>bkpt</var> argument is of the same form as returned by the various
breakpoint commands; See <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Breakpoint-Commands">GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands</a>.  The
<var>number</var> is the ordinal number of the breakpoint.

     <p>Note that if a breakpoint is emitted in the result record of a
command, then it will not also be emitted in an async record.

     <br><dt><code>=record-started,thread-group="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dt><code>=record-stopped,thread-group="</code><var>id</var><code>"</code><dd>Execution log recording was either started or stopped on an
inferior.  The <var>id</var> is the <span class="sc">gdb</span> identifier of the thread
group corresponding to the affected inferior.

     <br><dt><code>=cmd-param-changed,param=</code><var>param</var><code>,value=</code><var>value</var><dd>Reports that a parameter of the command <code>set </code><var>param</var> is
changed to <var>value</var>.  In the multi-word <code>set</code> command,
the <var>param</var> is the whole parameter list to <code>set</code> command. 
For example, In command <code>set check type on</code>, <var>param</var>
is <code>check type</code> and <var>value</var> is <code>on</code>.

     <br><dt><code>=memory-changed,thread-group=</code><var>id</var><code>,addr=</code><var>addr</var><code>,len=</code><var>len</var><code>[,type="code"]</code><dd>Reports that bytes from <var>addr</var> to <var>data</var> + <var>len</var> were
written in an inferior.  The <var>id</var> is the identifier of the
thread group corresponding to the affected inferior.  The optional
<code>type="code"</code> part is reported if the memory written to holds
executable code.

of a multi-location breakpoint, this will be a dotted pair, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>type</code><dd>The type of the breakpoint.  For ordinary breakpoints this will be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">breakpoint</span></samp>&rsquo;, but many values are possible.

the breakpoint will be deleted at the next stop, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">keep</span></samp>&rsquo;,
meaning that the breakpoint will not be deleted.

     <br><dt><code>enabled</code><dd>This indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled, in which case the
value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, or disabled, in which case the value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;.

giving the address; or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;PENDING&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, for a pending
breakpoint; or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, for a breakpoint with
multiple locations.  This field will not be present if no address can
be determined.  For example, a watchpoint does not have an address.

     <br><dt><code>func</code><dd>If known, the function in which the breakpoint appears. 
If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>filename</code><dd>The name of the source file which contains this function, if known. 
If not known, this field is not present.

known.  If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>line</code><dd>The line number at which this breakpoint appears, if known. 
If not known, this field is not present.

     <br><dt><code>at</code><dd>If the source file is not known, this field may be provided.  If
provided, this holds the address of the breakpoint, possibly followed
by a symbol name.

     <br><dt><code>pending</code><dd>If this breakpoint is pending, this field is present and holds the
text used to set the breakpoint, as entered by the user.

     <br><dt><code>evaluated-by</code><dd>Where this breakpoint's condition is evaluated, either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>thread</code><dd>If this is a thread-specific breakpoint, then this identifies the
thread in which the breakpoint can trigger.

     <br><dt><code>task</code><dd>If this breakpoint is restricted to a particular Ada task, then this
field will hold the task identifier.

     <br><dt><code>cond</code><dd>If the breakpoint is conditional, this is the condition expression.

     <br><dt><code>ignore</code><dd>The ignore count of the breakpoint.

     <br><dt><code>enable</code><dd>The enable count of the breakpoint.

     <br><dt><code>traceframe-usage</code><dd>FIXME.

This field is optional.

     <br><dt><code>times</code><dd>The number of times the breakpoint has been hit.

     <br><dt><code>installed</code><dd>This field is only given for tracepoints.  This is either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
meaning that the tracepoint is installed, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning that it
is not.

     <br><dt><code>what</code><dd>Some extra data, the exact contents of which are type-dependent.

following line is passed to <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> as input, while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; means
the output received from <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>.

   <p>Note the line breaks shown in the examples are here only for
readability, they don't appear in the real output.

<h4 class="subheading">Setting a Breakpoint</h4>

<p>Setting a breakpoint generates synchronous output which contains detailed
information of the breakpoint.

<pre class="smallexample">     -&gt; -break-insert main

   <p>Please note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^exit</span></samp>&rsquo; is printed immediately, but it might
take some time for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to actually exit.  During that time, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
performs necessary cleanups, including killing programs being debugged
or disconnecting from debug hardware, so the frontend should wait till
<span class="sc">gdb</span> exits and should only forcibly kill <span class="sc">gdb</span> if it
fails to exit in reasonable time.

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>&rsquo; option, the search path is first reset and then addition
occurs as normal. 
Multiple directories may be specified, separated by blanks.  Specifying
multiple directories in a single command
results in the directories added to the beginning of the

If blanks are needed as
part of a directory name, double-quotes should be used around
the name.  In the command output, the path will show up separated
by the system directory-separator character.  The directory-separator
character must not be used
in any directory name. 
If no directories are specified, the current search path is displayed.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -exec-run [ --all | --thread-group N ] [ --start ]

   <p>Starts execution of the inferior from the beginning.  The inferior
executes until either a breakpoint is encountered or the program

the program has exited exceptionally.

   <p>When neither the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--all</span></samp>&rsquo; nor the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--thread-group</span></samp>&rsquo; option

group of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo;, and that thread group will be started. 
If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--all</span></samp>&rsquo; option is specified, then all inferiors will be started.

   <p>Using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--start</span></samp>&rsquo; option instructs the debugger to stop

<pre class="smallexample">     -enable-frame-filters

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows Python-based frame filters to affect the output of
the MI commands relating to stack traces.  As there is no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.

   <p>Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   <p>Note that if Python support has not been compiled into <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
this command will still succeed (and do nothing).

<h3 class="section">27.15 <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> Variable Objects</h3>

<h4 class="subheading">Introduction to Variable Objects</h4>

<p><a name="index-variable-objects-in-_0040sc_007bgdb_002fmi_007d-2977"></a>
Variable objects are "object-oriented" MI interface for examining and
changing values of expressions.  Unlike some other MI interfaces that
work with expressions, variable objects are specifically designed for
simple and efficient presentation in the frontend.  A variable object
is identified by string name.  When a variable object is created, the
frontend specifies the expression for that variable object.  The
expression can be a simple variable, or it can be an arbitrary complex
expression, and can even involve CPU registers.  After creating a
variable object, the frontend can invoke other variable object
operations&mdash;for example to obtain or change the value of a variable
object, or to change display format.

   <p>Variable objects have hierarchical tree structure.  Any variable object
that corresponds to a composite type, such as structure in C, has
a number of child variable objects, for example corresponding to each
element of a structure.  A child variable object can itself have
children, recursively.  Recursion ends when we reach
leaf variable objects, which always have built-in types.  Child variable
objects are created only by explicit request, so if a frontend
is not interested in the children of a particular variable object, no
child will be created.

   <p>For a leaf variable object it is possible to obtain its value as a
string, or set the value from a string.  String value can be also
obtained for a non-leaf variable object, but it's generally a string
that only indicates the type of the object, and does not list its
contents.  Assignment to a non-leaf variable object is not allowed.

   <p>A frontend does not need to read the values of all variable objects each time
the program stops.  Instead, MI provides an update command that lists all
variable objects whose values has changed since the last update
operation.  This considerably reduces the amount of data that must
be transferred to the frontend.  As noted above, children variable
objects are created on demand, and only leaf variable objects have a
real value.  As result, gdb will read target memory only for leaf
variables that frontend has created.

   <p>The automatic update is not always desirable.  For example, a frontend
might want to keep a value of some expression for future reference,
and never update it.  For another example,  fetching memory is
relatively slow for embedded targets, so a frontend might want
to disable automatic update for the variables that are either not
visible on the screen, or &ldquo;closed&rdquo;.  This is possible using so
called &ldquo;frozen variable objects&rdquo;.  Such variable objects are never
implicitly updated.

   <p>Variable objects can be either <dfn>fixed</dfn> or <dfn>floating</dfn>.  For the
fixed variable object, the expression is parsed when the variable
object is created, including associating identifiers to specific
variables.  The meaning of expression never changes.  For a floating
variable object the values of variables whose names appear in the
expressions are re-evaluated every time in the context of the current
frame.  Consider this example:

<pre class="smallexample">     void do_work(...)
     {
             struct work_state state;
     
             if (...)
                do_work(...);
     }
</pre>
   <p>If a fixed variable object for the <code>state</code> variable is created in
this function, and we enter the recursive call, the variable
object will report the value of <code>state</code> in the top-level
<code>do_work</code> invocation.  On the other hand, a floating variable
object will report the value of <code>state</code> in the current frame.

   <p>If an expression specified when creating a fixed variable object
refers to a local variable, the variable object becomes bound to the
thread and frame in which the variable object is created.  When such
variable object is updated, <span class="sc">gdb</span> makes sure that the
thread/frame combination the variable object is bound to still exists,
and re-evaluates the variable object in context of that thread/frame.

   <p>The following is the complete set of <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> operations defined to
access this functionality:

<h4 class="subheading">Description And Use of Operations on Variable Objects</h4>

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-enable-pretty-printing</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002denable_002dpretty_002dprinting-2978"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     -enable-pretty-printing
</pre>
   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows Python-based visualizers to affect the output of the
MI variable object commands.  However, because there was no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.

   <p>Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   <p>Note that if Python support has not been compiled into <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
this command will still succeed (and do nothing).

   <p>This feature is currently (as of <span class="sc">gdb</span> 7.0) experimental, and
may work differently in future versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-create</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dcreate-2979"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-create {<var>name</var> | "-"}
         {<var>frame-addr</var> | "*" | "@"} <var>expression</var>
</pre>
   <p>This operation creates a variable object, which allows the monitoring of
a variable, the result of an expression, a memory cell or a CPU
register.

   <p>The <var>name</var> parameter is the string by which the object can be
referenced.  It must be unique.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified, the varobj
system will generate a string &ldquo;varNNNNNN&rdquo; automatically.  It will be
unique provided that one does not specify <var>name</var> of that format. 
The command fails if a duplicate name is found.

   <p>The frame under which the expression should be evaluated can be
specified by <var>frame-addr</var>.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that the current
frame should be used.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that a floating variable
object must be created.

   <p><var>expression</var> is any expression valid on the current language set (must not
begin with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;), or one of the following:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span><var>addr</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>addr</var> is the address of a memory cell

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span><var>addr</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>addr</var></samp>&rsquo; &mdash; a memory address range (TBD)

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span><var>regname</var></samp>&rsquo; &mdash; a CPU register name
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-dynamic-varobj-2980"></a>A varobj's contents may be provided by a Python-based pretty-printer.  In this
case the varobj is known as a <dfn>dynamic varobj</dfn>.  Dynamic varobjs
have slightly different semantics in some cases.  If the
<code>-enable-pretty-printing</code> command is not sent, then <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will never create a dynamic varobj.  This ensures backward
compatibility for existing clients.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Result</h5>

<p>This operation returns attributes of the newly-created varobj.  These
are:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The name of the varobj.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numchild</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The number of children of the varobj.  This number is not necessarily
reliable for a dynamic varobj.  Instead, you must examine the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">has_more</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">value</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The varobj's scalar value.  For a varobj whose type is some sort of
aggregate (e.g., a <code>struct</code>), or for a dynamic varobj, this value
will not be interesting.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The varobj's type.  This is a string representation of the type, as
would be printed by the <span class="sc">gdb</span> CLI.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print object</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#Print-Settings">set print object</a>) is set to <code>on</code>, the
<em>actual</em> (derived) type of the object is shown rather than the
<em>declared</em> one.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread-id</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If a variable object is bound to a specific thread, then this is the
thread's identifier.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">has_more</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>For a dynamic varobj, this indicates whether there appear to be any
children available.  For a non-dynamic varobj, this will be 0.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This attribute will be present and have the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; if the
varobj is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj,
then this attribute will not be present.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">displayhint</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
<code>display_hint</code> method.  See <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>Typical output will look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">      name="<var>name</var>",numchild="<var>N</var>",type="<var>type</var>",thread-id="<var>M</var>",
       has_more="<var>has_more</var>"
</pre>
   <h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-delete</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002ddelete-2981"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-delete [ -c ] <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Deletes a previously created variable object and all of its children. 
With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>&rsquo; option, just deletes the children.

   <p>Returns an error if the object <var>name</var> is not found.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-set-format</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dformat-2982"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-set-format <var>name</var> <var>format-spec</var>
</pre>
   <p>Sets the output format for the value of the object <var>name</var> to be
<var>format-spec</var>.

   <p><a name="g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dformat"></a>The syntax for the <var>format-spec</var> is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">      <var>format-spec</var> ==&gt;
      {binary | decimal | hexadecimal | octal | natural}
</pre>
   <p>The natural format is the default format choosen automatically
based on the variable type (like decimal for an <code>int</code>, hex
for pointers, etc.).

   <p>For a variable with children, the format is set only on the
variable itself, and the children are not affected.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-show-format</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dshow_002dformat-2983"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-show-format <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Returns the format used to display the value of the object <var>name</var>.

   <h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-info-num-children</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dinfo_002dnum_002dchildren-2984"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-info-num-children <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Returns the number of children of a variable object <var>name</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">      numchild=<var>n</var>
</pre>
   <p>Note that this number is not completely reliable for a dynamic varobj. 
It will return the current number of children, but more children may
be available.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-list-children</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren-2985"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-list-children [<var>print-values</var>] <var>name</var> [<var>from</var> <var>to</var>]
</pre>
   <p><a name="g_t_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren"></a>Return a list of the children of the specified variable object and
create variable objects for them, if they do not already exist.  With
a single argument or if <var>print-values</var> has a value of 0 or
<code>--no-values</code>, print only the names of the variables; if
<var>print-values</var> is 1 or <code>--all-values</code>, also print their
values; and if it is 2 or <code>--simple-values</code> print the name and
value for simple data types and just the name for arrays, structures
and unions.

   <p><var>from</var> and <var>to</var>, if specified, indicate the range of children
to report.  If <var>from</var> or <var>to</var> is less than zero, the range is
reset and all children will be reported.  Otherwise, children starting
at <var>from</var> (zero-based) and up to and excluding <var>to</var> will be
reported.

   <p>If a child range is requested, it will only affect the current call to
<code>-var-list-children</code>, but not future calls to <code>-var-update</code>. 
For this, you must instead use <code>-var-set-update-range</code>.  The
intent of this approach is to enable a front end to implement any
update approach it likes; for example, scrolling a view may cause the
front end to request more children with <code>-var-list-children</code>, and
then the front end could call <code>-var-set-update-range</code> with a
different range to ensure that future updates are restricted to just
the visible items.

   <p>For each child the following results are returned:

     <dl>
<dt><var>name</var><dd>Name of the variable object created for this child.

     <br><dt><var>exp</var><dd>The expression to be shown to the user by the front end to designate this child. 
For example this may be the name of a structure member.

     <p>For a dynamic varobj, this value cannot be used to form an
expression.  There is no way to do this at all with a dynamic varobj.

     <p>For C/C<tt>++</tt> structures there are several pseudo children returned to
designate access qualifiers.  For these pseudo children <var>exp</var> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">public</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">private</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">protected</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In this case the
type and value are not present.

     <p>A dynamic varobj will not report the access qualifying
pseudo-children, regardless of the language.  This information is not
available at all with a dynamic varobj.

     <br><dt><var>numchild</var><dd>Number of children this child has.  For a dynamic varobj, this will be
0.

     <br><dt><var>type</var><dd>The type of the child.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print object</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#Print-Settings">set print object</a>) is set to <code>on</code>, the
<em>actual</em> (derived) type of the object is shown rather than the
<em>declared</em> one.

     <br><dt><var>value</var><dd>If values were requested, this is the value.

     <br><dt><var>thread-id</var><dd>If this variable object is associated with a thread, this is the thread id. 
Otherwise this result is not present.

     <br><dt><var>frozen</var><dd>If the variable object is frozen, this variable will be present with a value of 1.

     <br><dt><var>displayhint</var><dd>A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
<code>display_hint</code> method.  See <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>.

     <br><dt><var>dynamic</var><dd>This attribute will be present and have the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; if the
varobj is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj,
then this attribute will not be present.

   </dl>

   <p>The result may have its own attributes:

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-info-type <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Returns the type of the specified variable <var>name</var>.  The type is
returned as a string in the same format as it is output by the

   <h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-info-expression</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dinfo_002dexpression-2987"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-info-expression <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Returns a string that is suitable for presenting this
variable object in user interface.  The string is generally
not valid expression in the current language, and cannot be evaluated.

   <p>For example, if <code>a</code> is an array, and variable object
<code>A</code> was created for <code>a</code>, then we'll get this output:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) -var-info-expression A.1
     ^done,lang="C",exp="1"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the value of <code>lang</code> is the language name, which can be
found in <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>.

   <p>Note that the output of the <code>-var-list-children</code> command also
includes those expressions, so the <code>-var-info-expression</code> command
is of limited use.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-info-path-expression</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dinfo_002dpath_002dexpression-2988"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-info-path-expression <var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p>Returns an expression that can be evaluated in the current
context and will yield the same value that a variable object has. 
Compare this with the <code>-var-info-expression</code> command, which
result can be used only for UI presentation.  Typical use of
the <code>-var-info-path-expression</code> command is creating a
watchpoint from a variable object.

   <p>This command is currently not valid for children of a dynamic varobj,
and will give an error when invoked on one.

   <p>For example, suppose <code>C</code> is a C<tt>++</tt> class, derived from class
<code>Base</code>, and that the <code>Base</code> class has a member called
<code>m_size</code>.  Assume a variable <code>c</code> is has the type of
<code>C</code> and a variable object <code>C</code> was created for variable
<code>c</code>.  Then, we'll get this output:
<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) -var-info-path-expression C.Base.public.m_size

</pre>
   <p>Evaluates the expression that is represented by the specified variable

can be specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  The possible values of
this option are the same as for <code>-var-set-format</code>
(see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dformat">-var-set-format</a>).  If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; option is not specified,
the current display format will be used.  The current display format
can be changed using the <code>-var-set-format</code> command.

<pre class="smallexample">      value=<var>value</var>

   <p>Assigns the value of <var>expression</var> to the variable object specified

subsequent <code>-var-update</code> list.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Example</h5>

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-var-update</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvar_002dupdate-2992"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -var-update [<var>print-values</var>] {<var>name</var> | "*"}
</pre>
   <p>Reevaluate the expressions corresponding to the variable object
<var>name</var> and all its direct and indirect children, and return the
list of variable objects whose values have changed; <var>name</var> must
be a root variable object.  Here, &ldquo;changed&rdquo; means that the result of
<code>-var-evaluate-expression</code> before and after the
<code>-var-update</code> is different.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is used as the variable
object names, all existing variable objects are updated, except
for frozen ones (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dfrozen">-var-set-frozen</a>).  The option
<var>print-values</var> determines whether both names and values, or just
names are printed.  The possible values of this option are the same
as for <code>-var-list-children</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren">-var-list-children</a>).  It is
recommended to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--all-values</span></samp>&rsquo; option, to reduce the
number of MI commands needed on each program stop.

   <p>With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; parameter, if a variable object is bound to a
currently running thread, it will not be updated, without any
diagnostic.

   <p>If <code>-var-set-update-range</code> was previously used on a varobj, then
only the selected range of children will be reported.

   <p><code>-var-update</code> reports all the changed varobjs in a tuple named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">changelist</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Each item in the change list is itself a tuple holding:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">name</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The name of the varobj.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">value</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If values were requested for this update, then this field will be
present and will hold the value of the varobj.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in_scope</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="g_t_002dvar_002dupdate"></a>This field is a string which may take one of three values:

          <dl>
<dt><code>"true"</code><dd>The variable object's current value is valid.

          <br><dt><code>"false"</code><dd>The variable object does not currently hold a valid value but it may
hold one in the future if its associated expression comes back into
scope.

          <br><dt><code>"invalid"</code><dd>The variable object no longer holds a valid value. 
This can occur when the executable file being debugged has changed,
either through recompilation or by using the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>file</code>
command.  The front end should normally choose to delete these variable
objects. 
</dl>

     <p>In the future new values may be added to this list so the front should
be prepared for this possibility.  See <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Development-and-Front-Ends"><span class="sc">GDB/MI</span> Development and Front Ends</a>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type_changed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is only present if the varobj is still valid.  If the type
changed, then this will be the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">true</span></samp>&rsquo;; otherwise it will
be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>When a varobj's type changes, its children are also likely to have
become incorrect.  Therefore, the varobj's children are automatically
deleted when this attribute is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">true</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Also, the varobj's update
range, when set using the <code>-var-set-update-range</code> command, is
unset.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new_type</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If the varobj's type changed, then this field will be present and will
hold the new type.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new_num_children</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>For a dynamic varobj, if the number of children changed, or if the
type changed, this will be the new number of children.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numchild</span></samp>&rsquo; field in other varobj responses is generally not
valid for a dynamic varobj &ndash; it will show the number of children that
<span class="sc">gdb</span> knows about, but because dynamic varobjs lazily
instantiate their children, this will not reflect the number of
children which may be available.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new_num_children</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute only reports changes to the
number of children known by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This is the only way to
detect whether an update has removed children (which necessarily can
only happen at the end of the update range).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">displayhint</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The display hint, if any.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">has_more</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is an integer value, which will be 1 if there are more children
available outside the varobj's update range.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dynamic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This attribute will be present and have the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; if the
varobj is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj,
then this attribute will not be present.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new_children</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If new children were added to a dynamic varobj within the selected
update range (as set by <code>-var-set-update-range</code>), then they will
be listed in this attribute.

<var>flag</var> parameter should be either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; to make the variable
frozen or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; to make it unfrozen.  If a variable object is
frozen, then neither itself, nor any of its children, are
implicitly updated by <code>-var-update</code> of
a parent variable or by <code>-var-update *</code>.  Only
<code>-var-update</code> of the variable itself will update its value and
values of its children.  After a variable object is unfrozen, it is
implicitly updated by all subsequent <code>-var-update</code> operations. 
Unfreezing a variable does not update it, only subsequent
<code>-var-update</code> does.

   <p>Set a visualizer for the variable object <var>name</var>.

   <p><var>visualizer</var> is the visualizer to use.  The special value
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">None</span></samp>&rsquo; means to disable any visualizer in use.

   <p>If not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">None</span></samp>&rsquo;, <var>visualizer</var> must be a Python expression. 
This expression must evaluate to a callable object which accepts a
single argument.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will call this object with the value of
the varobj <var>name</var> as an argument (this is done so that the same
Python pretty-printing code can be used for both the CLI and MI). 
When called, this object must return an object which conforms to the
pretty-printing interface (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>).

   <p>The pre-defined function <code>gdb.default_visualizer</code> may be used to
select a visualizer by following the built-in process
(see <a href="#Selecting-Pretty_002dPrinters">Selecting Pretty-Printers</a>).  This is done automatically when
a varobj is created, and so ordinarily is not needed.

   <p>This feature is only available if Python support is enabled.  The MI
command <code>-list-features</code> (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Support-Commands">GDB/MI Support Commands</a>)
can be used to check this.

   <p>This command attempts to read all accessible memory regions in the
specified range.  First, all regions marked as unreadable in the memory
map (if one is defined) will be skipped.  See <a href="#Memory-Region-Attributes">Memory Region Attributes</a>.  Second, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will attempt to read the remaining
regions.  For each one, if reading full region results in an errors,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will try to read a subset of the region.

   <p>In general, every single memory unit in the region may be readable or not,
and the only way to read every readable unit is to try a read at
every address, which is not practical.   Therefore, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
attempt to read all accessible memory units at either beginning or the end
of the region, using a binary division scheme.  This heuristic works
well for reading accross a memory map boundary.  Note that if a region
has a readable range that is neither at the beginning or the end,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will not read it.

   <p>The result record (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Result-Records">GDB/MI Result Records</a>) that is output of
the command includes a field named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">memory</span></samp>&rsquo; whose content is a

     <br><dt><code>end</code><dd>The end address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Synopsis</h5>

<pre class="smallexample">      -trace-frame-collected

</pre>
   <p>This command returns the set of collected objects, register names,
trace state variable names, memory ranges and computed expressions
that have been collected at a particular trace frame.  The optional
parameters to the command affect the output format in different ways. 
See the output description table below for more details.

   <p>The reported names can be used in the normal manner to create
varobjs and inspect the objects themselves.  The items returned by
this command are categorized so that it is clear which is a variable,
which is a register, which is a trace state variable, which is a
memory range and which is a computed expression.

   <p>For instance, if the actions were
<pre class="smallexample">     collect myVar, myArray[myIndex], myObj.field, myPtr-&gt;field, myCount + 2
     collect *(int*)0xaf02bef0@40
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the object collected in its entirety would be <code>myVar</code>.  The
object <code>myArray</code> would be partially collected, because only the
element at index <code>myIndex</code> would be collected.  The remaining
objects would be computed expressions.

   <p>An example output would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb)
     -trace-frame-collected
     ^done,
       explicit-variables=[{name="myVar",value="1"}],

     <dl>
<dt><code>explicit-variables</code><dd>The set of objects that have been collected in their entirety (as
opposed to collecting just a few elements of an array or a few struct
members).  For each object, its name and value are printed. 
The <code>--var-print-values</code> option affects how or whether the value
field is output.  If <var>var_pval</var> is 0, then print only the names;
if it is 1, print also their values; and if it is 2, print the name,
type and value for simple data types, and the name and type for
arrays, structures and unions.

     <br><dt><code>computed-expressions</code><dd>The set of computed expressions that have been collected at the
current trace frame.  The <code>--comp-print-values</code> option affects
this set like the <code>--var-print-values</code> option affects the
<code>explicit-variables</code> set.  See above.

     <br><dt><code>registers</code><dd>The registers that have been collected at the current trace frame. 
For each register collected, the name and current value are returned. 
The value is formatted according to the <code>--registers-format</code>
option.  See the <samp><span class="command">-data-list-register-values</span></samp> command for a
list of the allowed formats.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>tvars</code><dd>The trace state variables that have been collected at the current
trace frame.  For each trace state variable collected, the name and
current value are returned.

     <br><dt><code>memory</code><dd>The set of memory ranges that have been collected at the current trace
frame.  Its content is a list of tuples.  Each tuple represents a
collected memory range and has the following fields:

          <dl>
<dt><code>address</code><dd>The start address of the memory range, as hexadecimal literal.

          <br><dt><code>length</code><dd>The length of the memory range, as decimal literal.

<p>Since new commands and features get regularly added to <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span>,
some commands are available to help front-ends query the debugger
about support for these capabilities.  Similarly, it is also possible
to query <span class="sc">gdb</span> about target support of certain features.

</pre>
   <p>Query support for the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> command named <var>cmd_name</var>.

   <p>Note that the dash (<code>-</code>) starting all <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> commands
is technically not part of the command name (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Input-Syntax">GDB/MI Input Syntax</a>), and thus should be omitted in <var>cmd_name</var>.  However,
for ease of use, this command also accepts the form with the leading
dash.

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">gdb</span> Command</h5>

<p>There is no corresponding <span class="sc">gdb</span> command.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Result</h5>

<p>The result is a tuple.  There is currently only one field:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exists</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This field is equal to <code>"true"</code> if the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> command exists,
<code>"false"</code> otherwise.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Example</h5>

<p>Here is an example where the <span class="sc">gdb/mi</span> command does not exist:

Returns a list of particular features of the MI protocol that
this version of gdb implements.  A feature can be a command,
or a new field in an output of some command, or even an
important bugfix.  While a frontend can sometimes detect presence
of a feature at runtime, it is easier to perform detection at debugger
startup.

   <p>The command returns a list of strings, with each string naming an
available feature.  Each returned string is just a name, it does not
have any internal structure.  The list of possible feature names
is given below.

   <p>Example output:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) -list-features

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-list-target-features</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dlist_002dtarget_002dfeatures-3044"></a>
Returns a list of particular features that are supported by the
target.  Those features affect the permitted MI commands, but
unlike the features reported by the <code>-list-features</code> command, the
features depend on which target GDB is using at the moment.  Whenever
a target can change, due to commands such as <code>-target-select</code>,
<code>-target-attach</code> or <code>-exec-run</code>, the list of target features
may change, and the frontend should obtain it again. 
Example output:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) -list-target-features
     ^done,result=["async"]
</pre>
   <p>The current list of features is:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">async</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Indicates that the target is capable of asynchronous command
execution, which means that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will accept further commands
while the target is running.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reverse</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Indicates that the target is capable of reverse execution. 
See <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>, for more information.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>-list-thread-groups</code> Command</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dlist_002dthread_002dgroups-3049"></a>

<h4 class="subheading">Synopsis</h4>

<pre class="smallexample">     -list-thread-groups [ --available ] [ --recurse 1 ] [ <var>group</var> ... ]
</pre>
   <p>Lists thread groups (see <a href="#Thread-groups">Thread groups</a>).  When a single thread
group is passed as the argument, lists the children of that group. 
When several thread group are passed, lists information about those
thread groups.  Without any parameters, lists information about all
top-level thread groups.

   <p>Normally, thread groups that are being debugged are reported. 
With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--available</span></samp>&rsquo; option, <span class="sc">gdb</span> reports thread groups
available on the target.

   <p>The output of this command may have either a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">threads</span></samp>&rsquo; result or
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">groups</span></samp>&rsquo; result.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; result has a list of tuples
as value, with each tuple describing a thread (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Thread-Information">GDB/MI Thread Information</a>).  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">groups</span></samp>&rsquo; result has a list of tuples as value,
each tuple describing a thread group.  If top-level groups are
requested (that is, no parameter is passed), or when several groups
are passed, the output always has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">groups</span></samp>&rsquo; result.  The format
of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">group</span></samp>&rsquo; result is described below.

   <p>To reduce the number of roundtrips it's possible to list thread groups
together with their children, by passing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--recurse</span></samp>&rsquo; option
and the recursion depth.  Presently, only recursion depth of 1 is
permitted.  If this option is present, then every reported thread group
will also include its children, either as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">group</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">threads</span></samp>&rsquo; field.

   <p>In general, any combination of option and parameters is permitted, with
the following caveats:

     <ul>
<li>When a single thread group is passed, the output will typically
be the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">threads</span></samp>&rsquo; result.  Because threads may not contain
anything, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">recurse</span></samp>&rsquo; option will be ignored.

     <li>When the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--available</span></samp>&rsquo; option is passed, limited information may
be available.  In particular, the list of threads of a process might
be inaccessible.  Further, specifying specific thread groups might
not give any performance advantage over listing all thread groups. 
The frontend should assume that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-list-thread-groups --available</span></samp>&rsquo;
is always an expensive operation and cache the results.

   </ul>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">groups</span></samp>&rsquo; result is a list of tuples, where each tuple may
have the following fields:

     <dl>
<dt><code>id</code><dd>Identifier of the thread group.  This field is always present. 
The identifier is an opaque string; frontends should not try to
convert it to an integer, even though it might look like one.

     <br><dt><code>type</code><dd>The type of the thread group.  At present, only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
valid type.

     <br><dt><code>pid</code><dd>The target-specific process identifier.  This field is only present
for thread groups of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo; and only if the process exists.

     <br><dt><code>exit-code</code><dd>The exit code of this group's last exited thread, formatted in octal. 
This field is only present for thread groups of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo; and
only if the process is not running.

     <br><dt><code>num_children</code><dd>The number of children this thread group has.  This field may be
absent for an available thread group.

     <br><dt><code>threads</code><dd>This field has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing a
thread.  It may be present if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--recurse</span></samp>&rsquo; option is
specified, and it's actually possible to obtain the threads.

     <br><dt><code>cores</code><dd>This field is a list of integers, each identifying a core that one
thread of the group is running on.  This field may be absent if
such information is not available.

     <br><dt><code>executable</code><dd>The name of the executable file that corresponds to this thread group. 
The field is only present for thread groups of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">process</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and only if there is a corresponding executable file.

<h3 class="section">28.1 What is an Annotation?</h3>

<p><a name="index-annotations-3056"></a>
Annotations start with a newline character, two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">control-z</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters, and the name of the annotation.  If there is no additional
information associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation
is followed immediately by a newline.  If there is additional
information, the name of the annotation is followed by a space, the
additional information, and a newline.  The additional information
cannot contain newline characters.

   <p>Any output not beginning with a newline and two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">control-z</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters denotes literal output from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Currently there is
no need for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to output a newline followed by two
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">control-z</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, but if there was such a need, the
annotations could be extended with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">escape</span></samp>&rsquo; annotation which
means those three characters as output.

   <p>The annotation <var>level</var>, which is specified using the
<samp><span class="option">--annotate</span></samp> command line option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Mode Options</a>), controls
how much information <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints together with its prompt,
values of expressions, source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0
is for no annotations, level 1 is for use when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is run as a
subprocess of <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable
for programs that control <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and level 2 annotations have
been made obsolete (see <a href="annotate.html#Limitations">Limitations of the Annotation Interface</a>).

     
<a name="index-set-annotate-3057"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set annotate </code><var>level</var><dd>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> command <code>set annotate</code> sets the level of
annotations to the specified <var>level</var>.

</dl>

   <p>This chapter describes level 3 annotations.

   <p>A simple example of starting up <span class="sc">gdb</span> with annotations is:

<h3 class="section">28.2 The Server Prefix</h3>

<p><a name="index-server-prefix-3059"></a>
If you prefix a command with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">server </span></samp>&rsquo; then it will not affect
the command history, nor will it affect <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s notion of which
command to repeat if &lt;RET&gt; is pressed on a line by itself.  This
means that commands can be run behind a user's back by a front-end in
a transparent manner.

   <p>The <code>server </code> prefix does not affect the recording of values into
the value history; to print a value without recording it into the
value history, use the <code>output</code> command instead of the
<code>print</code> command.

   <p>Using this prefix also disables confirmation requests
(see <a href="#confirmation-requests">confirmation requests</a>).

<h3 class="section">28.3 Annotation for <span class="sc">gdb</span> Input</h3>

<p><a name="index-annotations-for-prompts-3060"></a>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> prompts for input, it annotates this fact so it is possible
to know when to send output, when the output from a given command is
over, etc.

   <p>Different kinds of input each have a different <dfn>input type</dfn>.  Each
input type has three annotations: a <code>pre-</code> annotation, which
denotes the beginning of any prompt which is being output, a plain
annotation, which denotes the end of the prompt, and then a <code>post-</code>
annotation which denotes the end of any echo which may (or may not) be
associated with the input.  For example, the <code>prompt</code> input type
features the following annotations:

<pre class="smallexample">     ^Z^Zpre-prompt
     ^Z^Zprompt
     ^Z^Zpost-prompt
</pre>
   <p>The input types are

<h2 class="chapter">29 JIT Compilation Interface</h2>

<p><a name="index-just_002din_002dtime-compilation-3097"></a><a name="index-JIT-compilation-interface-3098"></a>
This chapter documents <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s <dfn>just-in-time</dfn> (JIT) compilation
interface.  A JIT compiler is a program or library that generates native
executable code at runtime and executes it, usually in order to achieve good
performance while maintaining platform independence.

   <p>Programs that use JIT compilation are normally difficult to debug because
portions of their code are generated at runtime, instead of being loaded from
object files, which is where <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally finds the program's symbols
and debug information.  In order to debug programs that use JIT compilation,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> has an interface that allows the program to register in-memory
symbol files with <span class="sc">gdb</span> at runtime.

   <p>If you are using <span class="sc">gdb</span> to debug a program that uses this interface, then
it should work transparently so long as you have not stripped the binary.  If
you are developing a JIT compiler, then the interface is documented in the rest
of this chapter.  At this time, the only known client of this interface is the
LLVM JIT.

   <p>Broadly speaking, the JIT interface mirrors the dynamic loader interface.  The
JIT compiler communicates with <span class="sc">gdb</span> by writing data into a global
variable and calling a fuction at a well-known symbol.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span>
attaches, it reads a linked list of symbol files from the global variable to
find existing code, and puts a breakpoint in the function so that it can find
out about additional code.

<h3 class="section">29.1 JIT Declarations</h3>

<p>These are the relevant struct declarations that a C program should include to
implement the interface:

<pre class="smallexample">     typedef enum
     {
       JIT_NOACTION = 0,
       JIT_REGISTER_FN,
       JIT_UNREGISTER_FN
     } jit_actions_t;
     
     struct jit_code_entry
     {
       struct jit_code_entry *next_entry;
       struct jit_code_entry *prev_entry;
       const char *symfile_addr;
       uint64_t symfile_size;
     };
     
     struct jit_descriptor
     {
       uint32_t version;
       /* This type should be jit_actions_t, but we use uint32_t
          to be explicit about the bitwidth.  */
       uint32_t action_flag;
       struct jit_code_entry *relevant_entry;
       struct jit_code_entry *first_entry;
     };
     
     /* GDB puts a breakpoint in this function.  */
     void __attribute__((noinline)) __jit_debug_register_code() { };
     
     /* Make sure to specify the version statically, because the
        debugger may check the version before we can set it.  */
     struct jit_descriptor __jit_debug_descriptor = { 1, 0, 0, 0 };
</pre>
   <p>If the JIT is multi-threaded, then it is important that the JIT synchronize any
modifications to this global data properly, which can easily be done by putting
a global mutex around modifications to these structures.

<h3 class="section">29.2 Registering Code</h3>

<p>To register code with <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the JIT should follow this protocol:

     <ul>
<li>Generate an object file in memory with symbols and other desired debug
information.  The file must include the virtual addresses of the sections.

     <li>Create a code entry for the file, which gives the start and size of the symbol
file.

     <li>Add it to the linked list in the JIT descriptor.

     <li>Point the relevant_entry field of the descriptor at the entry.

     <li>Set <code>action_flag</code> to <code>JIT_REGISTER</code> and call
<code>__jit_debug_register_code</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> is attached and the breakpoint fires, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the
<code>relevant_entry</code> pointer so it doesn't have to walk the list looking for
new code.  However, the linked list must still be maintained in order to allow
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to attach to a running process and still find the symbol files.

<h3 class="section">29.3 Unregistering Code</h3>

<p>If code is freed, then the JIT should use the following protocol:

     <ul>
<li>Remove the code entry corresponding to the code from the linked list.

     <li>Point the <code>relevant_entry</code> field of the descriptor at the code entry.

     <li>Set <code>action_flag</code> to <code>JIT_UNREGISTER</code> and call
<code>__jit_debug_register_code</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>If the JIT frees or recompiles code without unregistering it, then <span class="sc">gdb</span>
and the JIT will leak the memory used for the associated symbol files.

<h3 class="section">29.4 Custom Debug Info</h3>

<p><a name="index-custom-JIT-debug-info-3099"></a><a name="index-JIT-debug-info-reader-3100"></a>
Generating debug information in platform-native file formats (like ELF
or COFF) may be an overkill for JIT compilers; especially if all the
debug info is used for is displaying a meaningful backtrace.  The
issue can be resolved by having the JIT writers decide on a debug info
format and also provide a reader that parses the debug info generated
by the JIT compiler.  This section gives a brief overview on writing
such a parser.  More specific details can be found in the source file
<samp><span class="file">gdb/jit-reader.in</span></samp>, which is also installed as a header at
<samp><var>includedir</var><span class="file">/gdb/jit-reader.h</span></samp> for easy inclusion.

   <p>The reader is implemented as a shared object (so this functionality is
not available on platforms which don't allow loading shared objects at
runtime).  Two <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands, <code>jit-reader-load</code> and
<code>jit-reader-unload</code> are provided, to be used to load and unload
the readers from a preconfigured directory.  Once loaded, the shared
object is used the parse the debug information emitted by the JIT
compiler.

<h4 class="subsection">29.4.2 Writing JIT Debug Info Readers</h4>

<p><a name="index-writing-JIT-debug-info-readers-3103"></a>
As mentioned, a reader is essentially a shared object conforming to a
certain ABI.  This ABI is described in <samp><span class="file">jit-reader.h</span></samp>.

   <p><samp><span class="file">jit-reader.h</span></samp> defines the structures, macros and functions
required to write a reader.  It is installed (along with
<span class="sc">gdb</span>), in <samp><var>includedir</var><span class="file">/gdb</span></samp> where <var>includedir</var> is
the system include directory.

   <p>Readers need to be released under a GPL compatible license.  A reader
can be declared as released under such a license by placing the macro
<code>GDB_DECLARE_GPL_COMPATIBLE_READER</code> in a source file.

   <p>The entry point for readers is the symbol <code>gdb_init_reader</code>,
which is expected to be a function with the prototype

   <p><a name="index-gdb_005finit_005freader-3104"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     extern struct gdb_reader_funcs *gdb_init_reader (void);
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstruct-gdb_005freader_005ffuncs_007d-3105"></a>
<code>struct gdb_reader_funcs</code> contains a set of pointers to callback
functions.  These functions are executed to read the debug info
generated by the JIT compiler (<code>read</code>), to unwind stack frames
(<code>unwind</code>) and to create canonical frame IDs
(<code>get_Frame_id</code>).  It also has a callback that is called when the
reader is being unloaded (<code>destroy</code>).  The struct looks like this

<pre class="smallexample">     struct gdb_reader_funcs
     {
       /* Must be set to GDB_READER_INTERFACE_VERSION.  */
       int reader_version;
     
       /* For use by the reader.  */
       void *priv_data;
     
       gdb_read_debug_info *read;
       gdb_unwind_frame *unwind;
       gdb_get_frame_id *get_frame_id;
       gdb_destroy_reader *destroy;
     };
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstruct-gdb_005fsymbol_005fcallbacks_007d-3106"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstruct-gdb_005funwind_005fcallbacks_007d-3107"></a>
The callbacks are provided with another set of callbacks by
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to do their job.  For <code>read</code>, these callbacks are
passed in a <code>struct gdb_symbol_callbacks</code> and for <code>unwind</code>
and <code>get_frame_id</code>, in a <code>struct gdb_unwind_callbacks</code>. 
<code>struct gdb_symbol_callbacks</code> has callbacks to create new object
files and new symbol tables inside those object files.  <code>struct
gdb_unwind_callbacks</code> has callbacks to read registers off the current
frame and to write out the values of the registers in the previous
frame.  Both have a callback (<code>target_read</code>) to read bytes off the
target's address space.

<h2 class="chapter">30 In-Process Agent</h2>

<p><a name="index-debugging-agent-3108"></a>The traditional debugging model is conceptually low-speed, but works fine,
because most bugs can be reproduced in debugging-mode execution.  However,
as multi-core or many-core processors are becoming mainstream, and
multi-threaded programs become more and more popular, there should be more
and more bugs that only manifest themselves at normal-mode execution, for
example, thread races, because debugger's interference with the program's
timing may conceal the bugs.  On the other hand, in some applications,
it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the program's execution
long enough for the developer to learn anything helpful about its behavior. 
If the program's correctness depends on its real-time behavior, delays
introduced by a debugger might cause the program to fail, even when the
code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able to observe the program's
behavior without interrupting it.

   <p>Therefore, traditional debugging model is too intrusive to reproduce
some bugs.  In order to reduce the interference with the program, we can
reduce the number of operations performed by debugger.  The
<dfn>In-Process Agent</dfn>, a shared library, is running within the same
process with inferior, and is able to perform some debugging operations
itself.  As a result, debugger is only involved when necessary, and
performance of debugging can be improved accordingly.  Note that
interference with program can be reduced but can't be removed completely,
because the in-process agent will still stop or slow down the program.

   <p>The in-process agent can interpret and execute Agent Expressions
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>) during performing debugging operations.  The
agent expressions can be used for different purposes, such as collecting
data in tracepoints, and condition evaluation in breakpoints.

   <p><a name="Control-Agent"></a>You can control whether the in-process agent is used as an aid for
debugging with the following commands:

     
<a name="index-set-agent-on-3109"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set agent on</code><dd>Causes the in-process agent to perform some operations on behalf of the
debugger.  Just which operations requested by the user will be done
by the in-process agent depends on the its capabilities.  For example,
if you request to evaluate breakpoint conditions in the in-process agent,
and the in-process agent has such capability as well, then breakpoint
conditions will be evaluated in the in-process agent.

     <p><a name="index-set-agent-off-3110"></a><br><dt><code>set agent off</code><dd>Disables execution of debugging operations by the in-process agent.  All
of the operations will be performed by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h3 class="section">30.1 In-Process Agent Protocol</h3>

<p><a name="index-in_002dprocess-agent-protocol-3112"></a>
The in-process agent is able to communicate with both <span class="sc">gdb</span> and
GDBserver (see <a href="#In_002dProcess-Agent">In-Process Agent</a>).  This section documents the protocol
used for communications between <span class="sc">gdb</span> or GDBserver and the IPA. 
In general, <span class="sc">gdb</span> or GDBserver sends commands
(see <a href="#IPA-Protocol-Commands">IPA Protocol Commands</a>) and data to in-process agent, and then
in-process agent replies back with the return result of the command, or
some other information.  The data sent to in-process agent is composed
of primitive data types, such as 4-byte or 8-byte type, and composite
types, which are called objects (see <a href="#IPA-Protocol-Objects">IPA Protocol Objects</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">30.1.1 IPA Protocol Objects</h4>

<p><a name="index-ipa-protocol-objects-3113"></a>
The commands sent to and results received from agent may contain some
complex data types called <dfn>objects</dfn>.

   <p>The in-process agent is running on the same machine with <span class="sc">gdb</span>
or GDBserver, so it doesn't have to handle as much differences between
two ends as remote protocol (see <a href="#Remote-Protocol">Remote Protocol</a>) tries to handle. 
However, there are still some differences of two ends in two processes:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>word size.  On some 64-bit machines, <span class="sc">gdb</span> or GDBserver can be
compiled as a 64-bit executable, while in-process agent is a 32-bit one. 
<li>ABI.  Some machines may have multiple types of ABI, <span class="sc">gdb</span> or
GDBserver is compiled with one, and in-process agent is compiled with
the other one.
        </ol>

   <p>Here are the IPA Protocol Objects:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>agent expression object.  It represents an agent expression
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>). 
<a name="agent-expression-object"></a><li>tracepoint action object.  It represents a tracepoint action
(see <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>) to collect registers,
memory, static trace data and to evaluate expression. 
<a name="tracepoint-action-object"></a><li>tracepoint object.  It represents a tracepoint (see <a href="#Tracepoints">Tracepoints</a>). 
<a name="tracepoint-object"></a>
        </ol>

   <p>The following table describes important attributes of each IPA protocol
object:

Your bug reports play an essential role in making <span class="sc">gdb</span> reliable.

   <p>Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it
may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report is to help
the entire community by making the next version of <span class="sc">gdb</span> work better.  Bug
reports are your contribution to the maintenance of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

A number of companies and individuals offer support for <span class="sc">gnu</span> products. 
If you obtained <span class="sc">gdb</span> from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   <p>You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file <samp><span class="file">etc/SERVICE</span></samp> in the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs
distribution. 
<!-- should add a web page ref... -->

   <p>In any event, we also recommend that you submit bug reports for
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to <a href="mailto:report@adacore.com">mailto:report@adacore.com</a>.

   <p>The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<strong>report all the facts</strong>.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

   <p>Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter. 
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the debugger into doing the right thing despite
the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.  That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

   <p>Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix the
bug.  It may be that the bug has been reported previously, but neither
you nor we can know that unless your bug report is complete and
self-contained.

   <p>Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, &ldquo;Does this ring a
bell?&rdquo;  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to
<em>refuse to respond to them</em> except to chide the sender to report
bugs properly.

   <p>To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

     <ul>
<li>The version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> announces it if you start
with no arguments; you can also print it at any time using <code>show
version</code>.

     <p>Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

     <li>The details of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> build-time configuration. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> shows these details if you invoke it with the
<samp><span class="option">--configuration</span></samp> command-line option, or if you type
<code>show configuration</code> at <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s prompt.

     <li>What compiler (and its version) was used to compile <span class="sc">gdb</span>&mdash;e.g. 
&ldquo;gcc&ndash;2.8.1&rdquo;.

     <li>What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the program you are
debugging&mdash;e.g.  &ldquo;gcc&ndash;2.8.1&rdquo;, or &ldquo;HP92453-01 A.10.32.03 HP
C Compiler&rdquo;.  For <span class="sc">gcc</span>, you can say <kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
to get this information; for other compilers, see the documentation for
those compilers.

     <li>The command arguments you gave the compiler to compile your example and
observe the bug.  For example, did you use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo;?  To guarantee
you will not omit something important, list them all.  A copy of the
Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

     <p>If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.

     <li>A complete input script, and all necessary source files, that will
reproduce the bug.

     <li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, &ldquo;It gets a fatal signal.&rdquo;

     <p>Of course, if the bug is that <span class="sc">gdb</span> gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us
a chance to make a mistake.

     <p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of <span class="sc">gdb</span> is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in
the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might
crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a crash, then when
ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening for
us.  If you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be able
to draw any conclusion from our observations.

     <p><a name="index-script-3125"></a><a name="index-recording-a-session-script-3126"></a>To collect all this information, you can use a session recording program
such as <samp><span class="command">script</span></samp>, which is available on many Unix systems. 
Just run your <span class="sc">gdb</span> session inside <samp><span class="command">script</span></samp> and then
include the <samp><span class="file">typescript</span></samp> file with your bug report.

     <p>Another way to record a <span class="sc">gdb</span> session is to run <span class="sc">gdb</span>
inside Emacs and then save the entire buffer to a file.

     <li>If you wish to suggest changes to the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source, send us context
diffs.  If you even discuss something in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source, refer to
it by context, not by line number.

     <p>The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.

   </ul>

   <p>Here are some things that are not necessary:

     <ul>
<li>A description of the envelope of the bug.

     <p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

     <p>This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples. 
We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     <p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em>instead</em>
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.

     <p>However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.

     <li>A patch for the bug.

     <p>A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

     <p>Sometimes with a program as complicated as <span class="sc">gdb</span> it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be able
to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is fixed.

     <p>And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

     <li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     <p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

<h3 class="section">32.1 Introduction to Line Editing</h3>

<p>The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.

   <p>The text <kbd>C-k</kbd> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the &lt;k&gt; key is pressed while the Control key
is depressed.

   <p>The text <kbd>M-k</kbd> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the &lt;k&gt;
key is pressed. 
The Meta key is labeled &lt;ALT&gt; on many keyboards. 
On keyboards with two keys labeled &lt;ALT&gt; (usually to either side of
the space bar), the &lt;ALT&gt; on the left side is generally set to
work as a Meta key. 
The &lt;ALT&gt; key on the right may also be configured to work as a
Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a
Compose key for typing accented characters.

   <p>If you do not have a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key, or another key working as
a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing &lt;ESC&gt;
<em>first</em>, and then typing &lt;k&gt;. 
Either process is known as <dfn>metafying</dfn> the &lt;k&gt; key.

   <p>The text <kbd>M-C-k</kbd> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by <dfn>metafying</dfn> <kbd>C-k</kbd>.

   <p>In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
&lt;DEL&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt;, &lt;LFD&gt;, &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;RET&gt;, and &lt;TAB&gt; all
stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file
(see <a href="#Readline-Init-File">Readline Init File</a>). 
If your keyboard lacks a &lt;LFD&gt; key, typing &lt;C-j&gt; will
produce the desired character. 
The &lt;RET&gt; key may be labeled &lt;Return&gt; or &lt;Enter&gt; on
some keyboards.

<h3 class="section">32.2 Readline Interaction</h3>

<p><a name="index-interaction_002c-readline-3127"></a>
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press &lt;RET&gt;.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press &lt;RET&gt;; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line.

<h4 class="subsection">32.2.1 Readline Bare Essentials</h4>

<p><a name="index-notation_002c-readline-3128"></a><a name="index-command-editing-3129"></a><a name="index-editing-command-lines-3130"></a>
In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The typed
character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves one
space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use your
erase character to back up and delete the mistyped character.

   <p>Sometimes you may mistype a character, and
not notice the error until you have typed several other characters.  In
that case, you can type <kbd>C-b</kbd> to move the cursor to the left, and then
correct your mistake.  Afterwards, you can move the cursor to the right
with <kbd>C-f</kbd>.

   <p>When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that characters
to the right of the cursor are `pushed over' to make room for the text
that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text behind the cursor,
characters to the right of the cursor are `pulled back' to fill in the
blank space created by the removal of the text.  A list of the bare
essentials for editing the text of an input line follows.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-b</kbd><dd>Move back one character. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-f</kbd><dd>Move forward one character. 
<br><dt>&lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;Backspace&gt;<dd>Delete the character to the left of the cursor. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the character underneath the cursor. 
<br><dt>Printing&nbsp;characters<!-- /@w --><dd>Insert the character into the line at the cursor. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-_</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd><dd>Undo the last editing command.  You can undo all the way back to an
empty line. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">(Depending on your configuration, the &lt;Backspace&gt; key be set to
delete the character to the left of the cursor and the &lt;DEL&gt; key set
to delete the character underneath the cursor, like <kbd>C-d</kbd>, rather
than the character to the left of the cursor.)

<h4 class="subsection">32.2.2 Readline Movement Commands</h4>

<p>The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need
in order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many
other commands have been added in addition to <kbd>C-b</kbd>, <kbd>C-f</kbd>,
<kbd>C-d</kbd>, and &lt;DEL&gt;.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly
about the line.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-a</kbd><dd>Move to the start of the line. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-e</kbd><dd>Move to the end of the line. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-f</kbd><dd>Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and digits. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-b</kbd><dd>Move backward a word. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-l</kbd><dd>Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top. 
</dl>

   <p>Notice how <kbd>C-f</kbd> moves forward a character, while <kbd>M-f</kbd> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

<h4 class="subsection">32.2.3 Readline Killing Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-killing-text-3131"></a><a name="index-yanking-text-3132"></a>
<dfn>Killing</dfn> text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by <dfn>yanking</dfn> (re-inserting)
it back into the line. 
(`Cut' and `paste' are more recent jargon for `kill' and `yank'.)

   <p>If the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

   <p>When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a <dfn>kill-ring</dfn>. 
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it all.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line. 
<a name="index-kill-ring-3133"></a>
Here is the list of commands for killing text.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-k</kbd><dd>Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-d</kbd><dd>Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between
words, to the end of the next word. 
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <kbd>M-f</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill from the cursor the start of the current word, or, if between
words, to the start of the previous word. 
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <kbd>M-b</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-w</kbd><dd>Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different than
<kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> because the word boundaries differ.

   </dl>

   <p>Here is how to <dfn>yank</dfn> the text back into the line.  Yanking
means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-y</kbd><dd>Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-y</kbd><dd>Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this if
the prior command is <kbd>C-y</kbd> or <kbd>M-y</kbd>.

<h4 class="subsection">32.2.4 Readline Arguments</h4>

<p>You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the <i>sign</i> of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-- C-k</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta
digits before the command.  If the first `digit' typed is a minus
sign (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once
you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type
the remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <kbd>C-d</kbd> command an argument of 10, you could type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-1 0 C-d</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which will delete the next ten characters on the input line.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">32.2.5 Searching for Commands in the History</h4>

<p>Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
for lines containing a specified string. 
There are two search modes:  <dfn>incremental</dfn> and <dfn>non-incremental</dfn>.

   <p>Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string. 
As each character of the search string is typed, Readline displays
the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far. 
An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to
find the desired history entry. 
To search backward in the history for a particular string, type
<kbd>C-r</kbd>.  Typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> searches forward through the history. 
The characters present in the value of the <code>isearch-terminators</code> variable
are used to terminate an incremental search. 
If that variable has not been assigned a value, the &lt;ESC&gt; and
<kbd>C-J</kbd> characters will terminate an incremental search. 
<kbd>C-g</kbd> will abort an incremental search and restore the original line. 
When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
search string becomes the current line.

   <p>To find other matching entries in the history list, type <kbd>C-r</kbd> or
<kbd>C-s</kbd> as appropriate. 
This will search backward or forward in the history for the next
entry matching the search string typed so far. 
Any other key sequence bound to a Readline command will terminate
the search and execute that command. 
For instance, a &lt;RET&gt; will terminate the search and accept
the line, thereby executing the command from the history list. 
A movement command will terminate the search, make the last line found
the current line, and begin editing.

   <p>Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two
<kbd>C-r</kbd>s are typed without any intervening characters defining a new
search string, any remembered search string is used.

   <p>Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting
to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be
typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

<h3 class="section">32.3 Readline Init File</h3>

<p><a name="index-initialization-file_002c-readline-3134"></a>
Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like
keybindings installed by default, it is possible to use a different set
of keybindings. 
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an <dfn>inputrc</dfn> file, conventionally in his home directory. 
The name of this
file is taken from the value of the environment variable <samp><span class="env">INPUTRC</span></samp>.  If
that variable is unset, the default is <samp><span class="file">~/.inputrc</span></samp>.  If that
file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is
<samp><span class="file">/etc/inputrc</span></samp>.

   <p>When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
init file is read, and the key bindings are set.

   <p>In addition, the <code>C-x C-r</code> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">32.3.1 Readline Init File Syntax</h4>

<p>There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the
Readline init file.  Blank lines are ignored. 
Lines beginning with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; are comments. 
Lines beginning with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; indicate conditional
constructs (see <a href="#Conditional-Init-Constructs">Conditional Init Constructs</a>).  Other lines
denote variable settings and key bindings.

     <dl>
<dt>Variable Settings<dd>You can modify the run-time behavior of Readline by
altering the values of variables in Readline
using the <code>set</code> command within the init file. 
The syntax is simple:

     <pre class="example">          set <var>variable</var> <var>value</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Here, for example, is how to
change from the default Emacs-like key binding to use
<code>vi</code> line editing commands:

     <pre class="example">          set editing-mode vi
</pre>
     <p>Variable names and values, where appropriate, are recognized without regard
to case.  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.

     <p>Boolean variables (those that can be set to on or off) are set to on if
the value is null or empty, <var>on</var> (case-insensitive), or 1.  Any other
value results in the variable being set to off.

     <p>A great deal of run-time behavior is changeable with the following
variables.

     <p><a name="index-variables_002c-readline-3135"></a>
          <dl>
<dt><code>bell-style</code><dd><a name="index-bell_002dstyle-3136"></a>Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell. 
If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline never rings the bell.  If set to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">visible</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available. 
If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">audible</span></samp>&rsquo; (the default), Readline attempts to ring
the terminal's bell.

          <br><dt><code>bind-tty-special-chars</code><dd><a name="index-bind_002dtty_002dspecial_002dchars-3137"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline attempts to bind the control characters
treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their Readline
equivalents.

          <br><dt><code>comment-begin</code><dd><a name="index-comment_002dbegin-3138"></a>The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
<code>insert-comment</code> command is executed.  The default value
is <code>"#"</code>.

          <br><dt><code>completion-display-width</code><dd><a name="index-completion_002ddisplay_002dwidth-3139"></a>The number of screen columns used to display possible matches
when performing completion. 
The value is ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal
screen width. 
A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line. 
The default value is -1.

          <br><dt><code>completion-ignore-case</code><dd><a name="index-completion_002dignore_002dcase-3140"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline performs filename matching and completion
in a case-insensitive fashion. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>completion-map-case</code><dd><a name="index-completion_002dmap_002dcase-3141"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, and <var>completion-ignore-case</var> is enabled, Readline
treats hyphens (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;) and underscores (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;) as equivalent when
performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.

          <br><dt><code>completion-prefix-display-length</code><dd><a name="index-completion_002dprefix_002ddisplay_002dlength-3142"></a>The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible
completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a
value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are
replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.

          <br><dt><code>completion-query-items</code><dd><a name="index-completion_002dquery_002ditems-3143"></a>The number of possible completions that determines when the user is
asked whether the list of possibilities should be displayed. 
If the number of possible completions is greater than this value,
Readline will ask the user whether or not he wishes to view
them; otherwise, they are simply listed. 
This variable must be set to an integer value greater than or equal to 0. 
A negative value means Readline should never ask. 
The default limit is <code>100</code>.

          <br><dt><code>convert-meta</code><dd><a name="index-convert_002dmeta-3144"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will convert characters with the
eighth bit set to an <span class="sc">ascii</span> key sequence by stripping the eighth
bit and prefixing an &lt;ESC&gt; character, converting them to a
meta-prefixed key sequence.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>disable-completion</code><dd><a name="index-disable_002dcompletion-3145"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">On</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will inhibit word completion. 
Completion  characters will be inserted into the line as if they had
been mapped to <code>self-insert</code>.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>editing-mode</code><dd><a name="index-editing_002dmode-3146"></a>The <code>editing-mode</code> variable controls which default set of
key bindings is used.  By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing
mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.  This variable can be
set to either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vi</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>echo-control-characters</code><dd>When set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, on operating systems that indicate they support it,
readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the
keyboard.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>enable-keypad</code><dd><a name="index-enable_002dkeypad-3147"></a>When set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will try to enable the application
keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>enable-meta-key</code><dd>When set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will try to enable any meta modifier
key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many terminals,
the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters. 
The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>expand-tilde</code><dd><a name="index-expand_002dtilde-3148"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, tilde expansion is performed when Readline
attempts word completion.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>history-preserve-point</code><dd><a name="index-history_002dpreserve_002dpoint-3149"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, the history code attempts to place the point (the
current cursor position) at the
same location on each history line retrieved with <code>previous-history</code>
or <code>next-history</code>.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>history-size</code><dd><a name="index-history_002dsize-3150"></a>Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list.  If
set to zero, the number of entries in the history list is not limited.

          <br><dt><code>horizontal-scroll-mode</code><dd><a name="index-horizontal_002dscroll_002dmode-3151"></a>This variable can be set to either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Setting it
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the text of the lines being edited will scroll
horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than the width
of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen line.  By default,
this variable is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>input-meta</code><dd><a name="index-input_002dmeta-3152"></a><a name="index-meta_002dflag-3153"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it
will not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),
regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The name <code>meta-flag</code> is a
synonym for this variable.

          <br><dt><code>isearch-terminators</code><dd><a name="index-isearch_002dterminators-3154"></a>The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without
subsequently executing the character as a command (see <a href="#Searching">Searching</a>). 
If this variable has not been given a value, the characters &lt;ESC&gt; and
<kbd>C-J</kbd> will terminate an incremental search.

          <br><dt><code>keymap</code><dd><a name="index-keymap-3155"></a>Sets Readline's idea of the current keymap for key binding commands. 
Acceptable <code>keymap</code> names are
<code>emacs</code>,
<code>emacs-standard</code>,
<code>emacs-meta</code>,
<code>emacs-ctlx</code>,
<code>vi</code>,
<code>vi-move</code>,
<code>vi-command</code>, and
<code>vi-insert</code>. 
<code>vi</code> is equivalent to <code>vi-command</code>; <code>emacs</code> is
equivalent to <code>emacs-standard</code>.  The default value is <code>emacs</code>. 
The value of the <code>editing-mode</code> variable also affects the
default keymap.

          <br><dt><code>mark-directories</code><dd>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, completed directory names have a slash
appended.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>mark-modified-lines</code><dd><a name="index-mark_002dmodified_002dlines-3156"></a>This variable, when set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, causes Readline to display an
asterisk (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;) at the start of history lines which have been modified. 
This variable is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo; by default.

          <br><dt><code>mark-symlinked-directories</code><dd><a name="index-mark_002dsymlinked_002ddirectories-3157"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, completed names which are symbolic links
to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of
<code>mark-directories</code>). 
The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>match-hidden-files</code><dd><a name="index-match_002dhidden_002dfiles-3158"></a>This variable, when set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, causes Readline to match files whose
names begin with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; (hidden files) when performing filename
completion. 
If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;, the leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; must be
supplied by the user in the filename to be completed. 
This variable is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; by default.

          <br><dt><code>menu-complete-display-prefix</code><dd><a name="index-menu_002dcomplete_002ddisplay_002dprefix-3159"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, menu completion displays the common prefix of the
list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through
the list.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>output-meta</code><dd><a name="index-output_002dmeta-3160"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will display characters with the
eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
sequence.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>page-completions</code><dd><a name="index-page_002dcompletions-3161"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline uses an internal <code>more</code>-like pager
to display a screenful of possible completions at a time. 
This variable is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; by default.

          <br><dt><code>print-completions-horizontally</code><dd>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will display completions with matches
sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen. 
The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>revert-all-at-newline</code><dd><a name="index-revert_002dall_002dat_002dnewline-3162"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, Readline will undo all changes to history lines
before returning when <code>accept-line</code> is executed.  By default,
history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across
calls to <code>readline</code>.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>show-all-if-ambiguous</code><dd><a name="index-show_002dall_002dif_002dambiguous-3163"></a>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;,
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>show-all-if-unmodified</code><dd><a name="index-show_002dall_002dif_002dunmodified-3164"></a>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in
a fashion similar to <var>show-all-if-ambiguous</var>. 
If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;,
words which have more than one possible completion without any
possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share
a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead
of ringing the bell. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>skip-completed-text</code><dd><a name="index-skip_002dcompleted_002dtext-3165"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, this alters the default completion behavior when
inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when
performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline
does not insert characters from the completion that match characters
after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word
following the cursor are not duplicated. 
For instance, if this is enabled, attempting completion when the cursor
is after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo; will result in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo;
rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefilefile</span></samp>&rsquo;, assuming there is a single possible
completion. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>visible-stats</code><dd><a name="index-visible_002dstats-3166"></a>If set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;, a character denoting a file's type
is appended to the filename when listing possible
completions.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     </dl>

     <br><dt>Key Bindings<dd>The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is
simple.  First you need to find the name of the command that you
want to change.  The following sections contain tables of the command
name, the default keybinding, if any, and a short description of what
the command does.

     <p>Once you know the name of the command, simply place on a line
in the init file the name of the key
you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the name of the
command. 
There can be no space between the key name and the colon &ndash; that will be
interpreted as part of the key name. 
The name of the key can be expressed in different ways, depending on
what you find most comfortable.

     <p>In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound
to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <var>macro</var>).

          <dl>
<dt><var>keyname</var>:&nbsp;<var>function-name</var>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<var>macro</var><!-- /@w --><dd><var>keyname</var> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:
          <pre class="example">               Control-u: universal-argument
               Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
               Control-o: "&gt; output"
</pre>
          <p>In the above example, <kbd>C-u</kbd> is bound to the function
<code>universal-argument</code>,
<kbd>M-DEL</kbd> is bound to the function <code>backward-kill-word</code>, and
<kbd>C-o</kbd> is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt; output</span></samp>&rsquo; into the line).

          <p>A number of symbolic character names are recognized while
processing this key binding syntax:
<var>DEL</var>,
<var>ESC</var>,
<var>ESCAPE</var>,
<var>LFD</var>,
<var>NEWLINE</var>,
<var>RET</var>,
<var>RETURN</var>,
<var>RUBOUT</var>,
<var>SPACE</var>,
<var>SPC</var>,
and
<var>TAB</var>.

          <br><dt>"<var>keyseq</var>":&nbsp;<var>function-name</var>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<var>macro</var><!-- /@w --><dd><var>keyseq</var> differs from <var>keyname</var> above in that strings
denoting an entire key sequence can be specified, by placing
the key sequence in double quotes.  Some <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs style key
escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the
special character names are not recognized.

          <pre class="example">               "\C-u": universal-argument
               "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
               "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"
</pre>
          <p>In the above example, <kbd>C-u</kbd> is again bound to the function
<code>universal-argument</code> (just as it was in the first example),
&lsquo;<samp><kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>C-r</kbd></samp>&rsquo; is bound to the function <code>re-read-init-file</code>,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;[&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;~&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is bound to insert
the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Function Key 1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     </dl>

     <p>The following <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs style escape sequences are available when
specifying key sequences:

          <dl>
<dt><kbd>\C-</kbd><dd>control prefix
<br><dt><kbd>\M-</kbd><dd>meta prefix
<br><dt><kbd>\e</kbd><dd>an escape character
<br><dt><kbd>\\</kbd><dd>backslash
<br><dt><kbd>\"</kbd><dd>&lt;"&gt;, a double quotation mark
<br><dt><kbd>\'</kbd><dd>&lt;'&gt;, a single quote or apostrophe
</dl>

     <p>In addition to the <span class="sc">gnu</span> Emacs style escape sequences, a second
set of backslash escapes is available:

          <dl>
<dt><code>\a</code><dd>alert (bell)
<br><dt><code>\b</code><dd>backspace
<br><dt><code>\d</code><dd>delete
<br><dt><code>\f</code><dd>form feed
<br><dt><code>\n</code><dd>newline
<br><dt><code>\r</code><dd>carriage return
<br><dt><code>\t</code><dd>horizontal tab
<br><dt><code>\v</code><dd>vertical tab
<br><dt><code>\</code><var>nnn</var><dd>the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <var>nnn</var>
(one to three digits)
<br><dt><code>\x</code><var>HH</var><dd>the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <var>HH</var>
(one or two hex digits)
</dl>

     <p>When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must
be used to indicate a macro definition. 
Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name. 
In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded. 
Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text,
including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
For example, the following binding will make &lsquo;<samp><kbd>C-x</kbd><span class="samp"> \</span></samp>&rsquo;
insert a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; into the line:
     <pre class="example">          "\C-x\\": "\\"
</pre>
     </dl>

<h4 class="subsection">32.3.2 Conditional Init Constructs</h4>

<p>Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result
of tests.  There are four parser directives used.

     <dl>
<dt><code>$if</code><dd>The <code>$if</code> construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
Readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line;
no characters are required to isolate it.

          <dl>
<dt><code>mode</code><dd>The <code>mode=</code> form of the <code>$if</code> directive is used to test
whether Readline is in <code>emacs</code> or <code>vi</code> mode. 
This may be used in conjunction
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set keymap</span></samp>&rsquo; command, for instance, to set bindings in
the <code>emacs-standard</code> and <code>emacs-ctlx</code> keymaps only if
Readline is starting out in <code>emacs</code> mode.

          <br><dt><code>term</code><dd>The <code>term=</code> form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; is tested against both the full name of the terminal and
the portion of the terminal name before the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This
allows <code>sun</code> to match both <code>sun</code> and <code>sun-cmd</code>,
for instance.

          <br><dt><code>application</code><dd>The <var>application</var> construct is used to include
application-specific settings.  Each program using the Readline
library sets the <var>application name</var>, and you can test for
a particular value. 
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a
key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:
          <pre class="example">               $if Bash
               # Quote the current or previous word
               "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
               $endif
</pre>
          </dl>

     <br><dt><code>$endif</code><dd>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an
<code>$if</code> command.

     <br><dt><code>$else</code><dd>Commands in this branch of the <code>$if</code> directive are executed if
the test fails.

     <br><dt><code>$include</code><dd>This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands
and bindings from that file. 
For example, the following directive reads from <samp><span class="file">/etc/inputrc</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          $include /etc/inputrc
</pre>
     </dl>

If this line is
non-empty, it may be added to the history list for future recall with
<code>add_history()</code>. 
If this line is a modified history line, the history line is restored

being entered.

     <br><dt><code>reverse-search-history (C-r)</code><a name="index-reverse_002dsearch_002dhistory-_0028C_002dr_0029-3180"></a><dd>Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through
the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.

between the start of the current line and the point. 
This is a non-incremental search. 
By default, this command is unbound.

     <br><dt><code>history-search-backward ()</code><a name="index-history_002dsearch_002dbackward-_0028_0029-3185"></a><dd>Search backward through the history for the string of characters

the second word on the previous line) at point. 
With an argument <var>n</var>,
insert the <var>n</var>th word from the previous command (the words
in the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument
inserts the <var>n</var>th word from the end of the previous command. 
Once the argument <var>n</var> is computed, the argument is extracted
as if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo; history expansion had been specified.

     <br><dt><code>yank-last-arg (M-. or M-_)</code><a name="index-yank_002dlast_002darg-_0028M_002d_002e-or-M_002d_005f_0029-3187"></a><dd>Insert last argument to the previous command (the last word of the
previous history entry). 
With a numeric argument, behave exactly like <code>yank-nth-arg</code>. 
Successive calls to <code>yank-last-arg</code> move back through the history
list, inserting the last word (or the word specified by the argument to
the first call) of each line in turn. 
Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls determines
the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument switches
the direction through the history (back or forward). 
The history expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument,
as if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!$</span></samp>&rsquo; history expansion had been specified.

transposes the last two characters of the line. 
Negative arguments have no effect.

     <br><dt><code>transpose-words (M-t)</code><a name="index-transpose_002dwords-_0028M_002dt_0029-3194"></a><dd>Drag the word before point past the word after point,
moving point past that word as well.

capitalize the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

     <br><dt><code>overwrite-mode ()</code><a name="index-overwrite_002dmode-_0028_0029-3198"></a><dd>Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument,
switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric
argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only
<code>emacs</code> mode; <code>vi</code> mode does overwrite differently. 
Each call to <code>readline()</code> starts in insert mode.

     <p>In overwrite mode, characters bound to <code>self-insert</code> replace
the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right. 
Characters bound to <code>backward-delete-char</code> replace the character
before point with a space.

any bindings or variable assignments found there.

     <br><dt><code>abort (C-g)</code><a name="index-abort-_0028C_002dg_0029-3226"></a><dd>Abort the current editing command and
ring the terminal's bell (subject to the setting of
<code>bell-style</code>).

     <br><dt><code>do-uppercase-version (M-a, M-b, M-</code><var>x</var><code>, ...)</code><a name="index-do_002duppercase_002dversion-_0028M_002da_002c-M_002db_002c-M_002d_0040var_007bx_007d_002c-_0040dots_007b_007d_0029-3227"></a><dd>If the metafied character <var>x</var> is lowercase, run the command
that is bound to the corresponding uppercase character.

     <br><dt><code>prefix-meta (&lt;ESC&gt;)</code><a name="index-prefix_002dmeta-_0028_0040key_007bESC_007d_0029-3228"></a><dd>Metafy the next character typed.  This is for keyboards
without a meta key.  Typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ESC&gt; f</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to typing
<kbd>M-f</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>undo (C-_ or C-x C-u)</code><a name="index-undo-_0028C_002d_005f-or-C_002dx-C_002du_0029-3229"></a><dd>Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.

command enough times to get back to the beginning.

     <br><dt><code>tilde-expand (M-~)</code><dd>Perform tilde expansion on the current word.

     <br><dt><code>set-mark (C-@)</code><a name="index-set_002dmark-_0028C_002d_0040_0040_0029-3231"></a><dd>Set the mark to the point.  If a
numeric argument is supplied, the mark is set to that position.

     <br><dt><code>exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)</code><a name="index-exchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark-_0028C_002dx-C_002dx_0029-3232"></a><dd>Swap the point with the mark.  The current cursor position is set to
the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved as the mark.

     <br><dt><code>skip-csi-sequence ()</code><a name="index-skip_002dcsi_002dsequence-_0028_0029-3235"></a><dd>Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as those
defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences begin with a
Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.  If this sequence is
bound to "\e[", keys producing such sequences will have no effect
unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of inserting
stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is unbound by default,
but usually bound to ESC-[.

     <br><dt><code>insert-comment (M-#)</code><a name="index-insert_002dcomment-_0028M_002d_0023_0029-3236"></a><dd>Without a numeric argument, the value of the <code>comment-begin</code>
variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line. 
If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:  if
the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value
of <code>comment-begin</code>, the value is inserted, otherwise
the characters in <code>comment-begin</code> are deleted from the beginning of
the line. 
In either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.

     <br><dt><code>dump-functions ()</code><a name="index-dump_002dfunctions-_0028_0029-3237"></a><dd>Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the
Readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
of an <var>inputrc</var> file.  This command is unbound by default.

     <br><dt><code>dump-variables ()</code><a name="index-dump_002dvariables-_0028_0029-3238"></a><dd>Print all of the settable variables and their values to the
Readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
of an <var>inputrc</var> file.  This command is unbound by default.

     <br><dt><code>dump-macros ()</code><a name="index-dump_002dmacros-_0028_0029-3239"></a><dd>Print all of the Readline key sequences bound to macros and the
strings they output.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
of an <var>inputrc</var> file.  This command is unbound by default.

     <br><dt><code>emacs-editing-mode (C-e)</code><dd>When in <code>vi</code> command mode, this causes a switch to <code>emacs</code>
editing mode.

     <br><dt><code>vi-editing-mode (M-C-j)</code><dd>When in <code>emacs</code> editing mode, this causes a switch to <code>vi</code>
editing mode.

<h3 class="section">32.5 Readline vi Mode</h3>

<p>While the Readline library does not have a full set of <code>vi</code>
editing functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing
of the line.  The Readline <code>vi</code> mode behaves as specified in
the <span class="sc">posix</span> standard.

   <p>In order to switch interactively between <code>emacs</code> and <code>vi</code>
editing modes, use the command <kbd>M-C-j</kbd> (bound to emacs-editing-mode
when in <code>vi</code> mode and to vi-editing-mode in <code>emacs</code> mode). 
The Readline default is <code>emacs</code> mode.

   <p>When you enter a line in <code>vi</code> mode, you are already placed in
`insertion' mode, as if you had typed an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Pressing &lt;ESC&gt;
switches you into `command' mode, where you can edit the text of the
line with the standard <code>vi</code> movement keys, move to previous
history lines with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; and subsequent lines with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
so forth.

<h3 class="section">33.1 History Expansion</h3>

<p><a name="index-history-expansion-3240"></a>
The History library provides a history expansion feature that is similar
to the history expansion provided by <code>csh</code>.  This section
describes the syntax used to manipulate the history information.

   <p>History expansions introduce words from the history list into
the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the
arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or
fix errors in previous commands quickly.

   <p>History expansion takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine
which line from the history list should be used during substitution. 
The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the
current one.  The line selected from the history is called the
<dfn>event</dfn>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are
called <dfn>words</dfn>.  Various <dfn>modifiers</dfn> are available to manipulate
the selected words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion
that Bash does, so that several words
surrounded by quotes are considered one word. 
History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the
history expansion character, which is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; by default.

<h4 class="subsection">33.1.2 Word Designators</h4>

<p>Word designators are used to select desired words from the event. 
A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; separates the event specification from the word designator.  It
may be omitted if the word designator begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Words are numbered from the beginning
of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are
inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.

   <p>For example,

     <dl>
<dt><code>!!</code><dd>designates the preceding command.  When you type this, the preceding
command is repeated in toto.

     <br><dt><code>!!:$</code><dd>designates the last argument of the preceding command.  This may be
shortened to <code>!$</code>.

     <br><dt><code>!fi:2</code><dd>designates the second argument of the most recent command starting with
the letters <code>fi</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>Here are the word designators:

     <dl>
<dt><code>0 (zero)</code><dd>The <code>0</code>th word.  For many applications, this is the command word.

     <br><dt><var>n</var><dd>The <var>n</var>th word.

     <br><dt><code>^</code><dd>The first argument; that is, word 1.

     <br><dt><code>$</code><dd>The last argument.

     <br><dt><code>%</code><dd>The word matched by the most recent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span><var>string</var><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; search.

     <br><dt><var>x</var><code>-</code><var>y</var><dd>A range of words; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo; abbreviates &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0-</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>*</code><dd>All of the words, except the <code>0</code>th.  This is a synonym for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1-$</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
It is not an error to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; if there is just one word in the event;
the empty string is returned in that case.

     <br><dt><var>x</var><code>*</code><dd>Abbreviates &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">-$</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt><var>x</var><code>-</code><dd>Abbreviates &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">-$</span></samp>&rsquo; like &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, but omits the last word.

   </dl>

   <p>If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the
previous command is used as the event.

<h4 class="subsection">33.1.3 Modifiers</h4>

<p>After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or more
of the following modifiers, each preceded by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <dl>
<dt><code>h</code><dd>Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.

     <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

     <br><dt><code>r</code><dd>Remove a trailing suffix of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span><var>suffix</var></samp>&rsquo;, leaving
the basename.

     <br><dt><code>e</code><dd>Remove all but the trailing suffix.

     <br><dt><code>p</code><dd>Print the new command but do not execute it.

     <br><dt><code>s/</code><var>old</var><code>/</code><var>new</var><code>/</code><dd>Substitute <var>new</var> for the first occurrence of <var>old</var> in the
event line.  Any delimiter may be used in place of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The delimiter may be quoted in <var>old</var> and <var>new</var>
with a single backslash.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in <var>new</var>,
it is replaced by <var>old</var>.  A single backslash will quote
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last
character on the input line.

     <br><dt><code>&amp;</code><dd>Repeat the previous substitution.

     <br><dt><code>g</code><dt><code>a</code><dd>Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  Used in
conjunction with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;, as in <code>gs/</code><var>old</var><code>/</code><var>new</var><code>/</code>,
or with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>G</code><dd>Apply the following &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; modifier once to each word in the event.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A In Memoriam</h2>

<p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> project mourns the loss of the following long-time
contributors:

     <dl>
<dt><code>Fred Fish</code><dd>Fred was a long-standing contributor to <span class="sc">gdb</span> (1991-2006), and
to Free Software in general.  Outside of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, he was known in
the Amiga world for his series of Fish Disks, and the GeekGadget project.

     <br><dt><code>Michael Snyder</code><dd>Michael was one of the Global Maintainers of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> project,
with contributions recorded as early as 1996, until 2011.  In addition
to his day to day participation, he was a large driving force behind
adding Reverse Debugging to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Formatting Documentation</h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-reference-card-3243"></a><a name="index-reference-card-3244"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp>
subdirectory of the main source directory<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-18" name="fnd-18"><sup>18</sup></a>.  If you can use PostScript or Ghostscript with your printer,
you can print the reference card immediately with <samp><span class="file">refcard.ps</span></samp>.

   <p>The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You
can format it, using TeX, by typing:

<pre class="smallexample">     make refcard.dvi
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> reference card is designed to print in <dfn>landscape</dfn>
mode on US &ldquo;letter&rdquo; size paper;
that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your <span class="sc">dvi</span> output program.

   <p><a name="index-documentation-3245"></a>
All the documentation for <span class="sc">gdb</span> comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or <code>texi2roff</code>) to typeset the printed version.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info
version of this manual in the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> subdirectory.  The main Info
file is <samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/gdb/gdb.info</span></samp>, and it refers to
subordinate files matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb.info*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the same directory.  If
necessary, you can print out these files, or read them with any editor;
but they are easier to read using the <code>info</code> subsystem in <span class="sc">gnu</span>
Emacs or the standalone <code>info</code> program, available as part of the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> Texinfo distribution.

   <p>If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as <code>texinfo-format-buffer</code> or
<code>makeinfo</code>.

   <p>If you have <code>makeinfo</code> installed, and are in the top level
<span class="sc">gdb</span> source directory (<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp>, in the case of
version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019), you can make the Info file by typing:

<pre class="smallexample">     cd gdb
     make gdb.info
</pre>
   <p>If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its <span class="sc">dvi</span> output files, and <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>, the
Texinfo definitions file.

   <p>TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called <span class="sc">dvi</span> files.  To print a typeset
document, you need a program to print <span class="sc">dvi</span> files.  If your system
has TeX installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise
command to use depends on your system; <kbd>lpr -d</kbd> is common; another
(for PostScript devices) is <kbd>dvips</kbd>.  The <span class="sc">dvi</span> print command may
require a file name without any extension or a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.dvi</span></samp>&rsquo; extension.

   <p>TeX also requires a macro definitions file called
<samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>.  This file tells TeX how to typeset a document
written in Texinfo format.  On its own, TeX cannot either read or
typeset a Texinfo file.  <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp> is distributed with GDB
and is located in the <samp><span class="file">gdb-</span><var>version-number</var><span class="file">/texinfo</span></samp>
directory.

   <p>If you have TeX and a <span class="sc">dvi</span> printer program installed, you can
typeset and print this manual.  First switch to the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp>
subdirectory of the main source directory (for example, to
<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/gdb</span></samp>) and type:

<pre class="smallexample">     make gdb.dvi
</pre>
   <p>Then give <samp><span class="file">gdb.dvi</span></samp> to your <span class="sc">dvi</span> printing program.

<dt>Expat<dd><a name="Expat"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> can use the Expat XML parsing library.  This library may be
included with your operating system distribution; if it is not, you
can get the latest version from <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net">http://expat.sourceforge.net</a>. 
The <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script will search for this library in several
standard locations; if it is installed in an unusual path, you can
use the <samp><span class="option">--with-libexpat-prefix</span></samp> option to specify its location.

     <p>Expat is used for:

          <ul>
<li>Remote protocol memory maps (see <a href="#Memory-Map-Format">Memory Map Format</a>)
<li>Target descriptions (see <a href="#Target-Descriptions">Target Descriptions</a>)

     <br><dt>zlib<dd><a name="index-compressed-debug-sections-3248"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> will use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zlib</span></samp>&rsquo; library, if available, to read
compressed debug sections.  Some linkers, such as GNU gold, are capable
of producing binaries with compressed debug sections.  If <span class="sc">gdb</span>
is compiled with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zlib</span></samp>&rsquo;, it will be able to read the debug
information in such binaries.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zlib</span></samp>&rsquo; library is likely included with your operating system
distribution; if it is not, you can get the latest version from
<a href="http://zlib.net">http://zlib.net</a>.

     <br><dt>iconv<dd><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s features related to character sets (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>) require a functioning <code>iconv</code> implementation.  If you are
on a GNU system, then this is provided by the GNU C Library.  Some
other systems also provide a working <code>iconv</code>.

     <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is using the <code>iconv</code> program which is installed
in a non-standard place, you will need to tell <span class="sc">gdb</span> where to find it. 
This is done with <samp><span class="option">--with-iconv-bin</span></samp> which specifies the
directory that contains the <code>iconv</code> program.

     <p>On systems without <code>iconv</code>, you can install GNU Libiconv.  If you
have previously installed Libiconv, you can use the
<samp><span class="option">--with-libiconv-prefix</span></samp> option to configure.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s top-level <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> will
arrange to build Libiconv if a directory named <samp><span class="file">libiconv</span></samp> appears
in the top-most source directory.  If Libiconv is built this way, and
if the operating system does not provide a suitable <code>iconv</code>
implementation, then the just-built library will automatically be used
by <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  One easy way to set this up is to download GNU
Libiconv, unpack it, and then rename the directory holding the
Libiconv source code to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libiconv</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h3 class="section">C.2 Invoking the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> Script</h3>

<p><a name="index-configuring-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-3249"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> comes with a <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script that automates the process
of preparing <span class="sc">gdb</span> for installation; you can then use <code>make</code> to
build the <code>gdb</code> program.

   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> distribution includes all the source code you need for
<span class="sc">gdb</span> in a single directory, whose name is usually composed by
appending the version number to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>For example, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019 distribution is in the
<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp> directory.  That directory contains:

     <dl>
<dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/configure </code><span class="roman">(and supporting files)</span><dd>script for configuring <span class="sc">gdb</span> and all its supporting libraries

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/gdb</code><dd>the source specific to <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/bfd</code><dd>source for the Binary File Descriptor library

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/include</code><dd><span class="sc">gnu</span> include files

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/libiberty</code><dd>source for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-liberty</span></samp>&rsquo; free software library

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/opcodes</code><dd>source for the library of opcode tables and disassemblers

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/readline</code><dd>source for the <span class="sc">gnu</span> command-line interface

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/glob</code><dd>source for the <span class="sc">gnu</span> filename pattern-matching subroutine

     <br><dt><code>gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/mmalloc</code><dd>source for the <span class="sc">gnu</span> memory-mapped malloc package
</dl>

   <p>The simplest way to configure and build <span class="sc">gdb</span> is to run <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
from the <samp><span class="file">gdb-</span><var>version-number</var></samp> source directory, which in
this example is the <samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp> directory.

   <p>First switch to the <samp><span class="file">gdb-</span><var>version-number</var></samp> source directory
if you are not already in it; then run <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>.  Pass the
identifier for the platform on which <span class="sc">gdb</span> will run as an
argument.

   <p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     cd gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019
     ./configure <var>host</var>
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>host</var> is an identifier such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sun4</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">decstation</span></samp>&rsquo;, that identifies the platform where <span class="sc">gdb</span> will run. 
(You can often leave off <var>host</var>; <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> tries to guess the
correct value by examining your system.)

   <p>Running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure </span><var>host</var></samp>&rsquo; and then running <code>make</code> builds the
<samp><span class="file">bfd</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">readline</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">mmalloc</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">libiberty</span></samp>
libraries, then <code>gdb</code> itself.  The configured source files, and the
binaries, are left in the corresponding source directories.

   <p><samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> is a Bourne-shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>) script; if your
system does not recognize this automatically when you run a different
shell, you may need to run <code>sh</code> on it explicitly:

<pre class="smallexample">     sh configure <var>host</var>
</pre>
   <p>If you run <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> from a directory that contains source
directories for multiple libraries or programs, such as the
<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp> source directory for version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019,
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
creates configuration files for every directory level underneath (unless
you tell it not to, with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--norecursion</span></samp>&rsquo; option).

   <p>You should run the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script from the top directory in the
source tree, the <samp><span class="file">gdb-</span><var>version-number</var></samp> directory.  If you run
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> from one of the subdirectories, you will configure only
that subdirectory.  That is usually not what you want.  In particular,
if you run the first <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> from the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> subdirectory
of the <samp><span class="file">gdb-</span><var>version-number</var></samp> directory, you will omit the
configuration of <samp><span class="file">bfd</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">readline</span></samp>, and other sibling
directories of the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> subdirectory.  This leads to build errors
about missing include files such as <samp><span class="file">bfd/bfd.h</span></samp>.

   <p>You can install <code>gdb</code> anywhere; it has no hardwired paths. 
However, you should make sure that the shell on your path (named by
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SHELL</span></samp>&rsquo; environment variable) is publicly readable.  Remember
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the shell to start your program&mdash;some systems refuse to
let <span class="sc">gdb</span> debug child processes whose programs are not readable.

<h3 class="section">C.3 Compiling <span class="sc">gdb</span> in Another Directory</h3>

<p>If you want to run <span class="sc">gdb</span> versions for several host or target machines,
you need a different <code>gdb</code> compiled for each combination of
host and target.  <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> is designed to make this easy by
allowing you to generate each configuration in a separate subdirectory,
rather than in the source directory.  If your <code>make</code> program
handles the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VPATH</span></samp>&rsquo; feature (<span class="sc">gnu</span> <code>make</code> does), running
<code>make</code> in each of these directories builds the <code>gdb</code>
program specified there.

   <p>To build <code>gdb</code> in a separate directory, run <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo; option to specify where to find the source. 
(You also need to specify a path to find <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
itself from your working directory.  If the path to <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
would be the same as the argument to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo;, you can leave out
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo; option; it is assumed.)

   <p>For example, with version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019, you can build <span class="sc">gdb</span> in a
separate directory for a Sun 4 like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     cd gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019
     mkdir ../gdb-sun4
     cd ../gdb-sun4
     ../gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/configure sun4
     make
</pre>
   <p>When <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you'd find the Sun 4 library <samp><span class="file">libiberty.a</span></samp> in the
directory <samp><span class="file">gdb-sun4/libiberty</span></samp>, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself in
<samp><span class="file">gdb-sun4/gdb</span></samp>.

   <p>Make sure that your path to the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script has just one
instance of <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> in it.  If your path to <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> looks
like <samp><span class="file">../gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/gdb/configure</span></samp>, you are configuring only
one subdirectory of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, not the whole package.  This leads to
build errors about missing include files such as <samp><span class="file">bfd/bfd.h</span></samp>.

   <p>One popular reason to build several <span class="sc">gdb</span> configurations in separate
directories is to configure <span class="sc">gdb</span> for cross-compiling (where
<span class="sc">gdb</span> runs on one machine&mdash;the <dfn>host</dfn>&mdash;while debugging
programs that run on another machine&mdash;the <dfn>target</dfn>). 
You specify a cross-debugging target by
giving the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--target=</span><var>target</var></samp>&rsquo; option to <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>.

   <p>When you run <code>make</code> to build a program or library, you must run
it in a configured directory&mdash;whatever directory you were in when you
called <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> (or one of its subdirectories).

   <p>The <code>Makefile</code> that <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> generates in each source
directory also runs recursively.  If you type <code>make</code> in a source
directory such as <samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp> (or in a separate configured
directory configured with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir=</span><var>dirname</var><span class="samp">/gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp>&rsquo;), you
will build all the required libraries, and then build GDB.

   <p>When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run <code>make</code> on them in parallel (for example,
if they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere
with each other.

<h3 class="section">C.4 Specifying Names for Hosts and Targets</h3>

<p>The specifications used for hosts and targets in the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
script are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short predefined
aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes three pieces
of information in the following pattern:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>architecture</var>-<var>vendor</var>-<var>os</var>
</pre>
   <p>For example, you can use the alias <code>sun4</code> as a <var>host</var> argument,
or as the value for <var>target</var> in a <code>--target=</code><var>target</var>
option.  The equivalent full name is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparc-sun-sunos4</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script accompanying <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not provide
any query facility to list all supported host and target names or
aliases.  <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> calls the Bourne shell script
<code>config.sub</code> to map abbreviations to full names; you can read the
script, if you wish, or you can use it to test your guesses on
abbreviations&mdash;for example:

<pre class="smallexample">     % sh config.sub i386-linux
     i386-pc-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub alpha-linux
     alpha-unknown-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub hp9k700
     hppa1.1-hp-hpux
     % sh config.sub sun4
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub sun3
     m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub i986v
     Invalid configuration `i986v': machine `i986v' not recognized
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>config.sub</code> is also distributed in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source
directory (<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019</span></samp>, for version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019).

<h3 class="section">C.6 System-wide configuration and settings</h3>

<p><a name="index-system_002dwide-init-file-3250"></a>
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can be configured to have a system-wide init file;
this file will be read and executed at startup (see <a href="#Startup">What <span class="sc">gdb</span> does during startup</a>).

   <p>Here is the corresponding configure option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>--with-system-gdbinit=</code><var>file</var><dd>Specify that the default location of the system-wide init file is
<var>file</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been configured with the option <samp><span class="option">--prefix=$prefix</span></samp>,
it may be subject to relocation.  Two possible cases:

     <ul>
<li>If the default location of this init file contains <samp><span class="file">$prefix</span></samp>,
it will be subject to relocation.  Suppose that the configure options
are <samp><span class="option">--prefix=$prefix --with-system-gdbinit=$prefix/etc/gdbinit</span></samp>;
if <span class="sc">gdb</span> is moved from <samp><span class="file">$prefix</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">$install</span></samp>, the system
init file is looked for as <samp><span class="file">$install/etc/gdbinit</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="file">$prefix/etc/gdbinit</span></samp>.

     <li>By contrast, if the default location does not contain the prefix,
it will not be relocated.  E.g. if <span class="sc">gdb</span> has been configured with
<samp><span class="option">--prefix=/usr/local --with-system-gdbinit=/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit</span></samp>,
then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will always look for <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit</span></samp>,
wherever <span class="sc">gdb</span> is installed. 
</ul>

   <p>If the configured location of the system-wide init file (as given by the
<samp><span class="option">--with-system-gdbinit</span></samp> option at configure time) is in the
data-directory (as specified by <samp><span class="option">--with-gdb-datadir</span></samp> at configure
time) or in one of its subdirectories, then <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for the
system-wide init file in the directory specified by the
<samp><span class="option">--data-directory</span></samp> command-line option. 
Note that the system-wide init file is only read once, during <span class="sc">gdb</span>
initialization.  If the data-directory is changed after <span class="sc">gdb</span> has
started with the <code>set data-directory</code> command, the file will not be
reread.

<p><a name="index-system_002dwide-configuration-scripts-3251"></a>
The <samp><span class="file">system-gdbinit</span></samp> directory, located inside the data-directory
(as specified by <samp><span class="option">--with-gdb-datadir</span></samp> at configure time) contains
a number of scripts which can be used as system-wide init files.  To
automatically source those scripts at startup, <span class="sc">gdb</span> should be
configured with <samp><span class="option">--with-system-gdbinit</span></samp>.  Otherwise, any user
should be able to source them by hand as needed.

   <p>The following scripts are currently available:

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Maintenance Commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-maintenance-commands-3256"></a><a name="index-internal-commands-3257"></a>
In addition to commands intended for <span class="sc">gdb</span> users, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
includes a number of commands intended for <span class="sc">gdb</span> developers,
that are not documented elsewhere in this manual.  These commands are
provided here for reference.  (For commands that turn on debugging
messages, see <a href="#Debugging-Output">Debugging Output</a>.)

     
<a name="index-maint-agent-3258"></a>
<a name="index-maint-agent_002deval-3259"></a>
<dl><dt><code>maint agent </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>-at </code><var>location</var><span class="roman">,</span><span class="roman">]</span> <var>expression</var><dt><code>maint agent-eval </code><span class="roman">[</span><code>-at </code><var>location</var><span class="roman">,</span><span class="roman">]</span> <var>expression</var><dd>Translate the given <var>expression</var> into remote agent bytecodes. 
This command is useful for debugging the Agent Expression mechanism
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>).  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">agent</span></samp>&rsquo; version produces an
expression useful for data collection, such as by tracepoints, while
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">maint agent-eval</span></samp>&rsquo; produces an expression that evaluates directly
to a result.  For instance, a collection expression for <code>globa +
globb</code> will include bytecodes to record four bytes of memory at each
of the addresses of <code>globa</code> and <code>globb</code>, while discarding
the result of the addition, while an evaluation expression will do the
addition and return the sum. 
If <code>-at</code> is given, generate remote agent bytecode for <var>location</var>. 
If not, generate remote agent bytecode for current frame PC address.

     <p><a name="index-maint-agent_002dprintf-3260"></a><br><dt><code>maint agent-printf </code><var>format</var><code>,</code><var>expr</var><code>,...</code><dd>Translate the given format string and list of argument expressions
into remote agent bytecodes and display them as a disassembled list. 
This command is useful for debugging the agent version of dynamic
printf (see <a href="#Dynamic-Printf">Dynamic Printf</a>).

     <p><a name="index-maint-info-breakpoints-3261"></a><br><dt><code><a name="maint-info-breakpoints"></a>maint info breakpoints</code><dd>Using the same format as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info breakpoints</span></samp>&rsquo;, display both the
breakpoints you've set explicitly, and those <span class="sc">gdb</span> is using for
internal purposes.  Internal breakpoints are shown with negative
breakpoint numbers.  The type column identifies what kind of breakpoint
is shown:

          <dl>
<dt><code>breakpoint</code><dd>Normal, explicitly set breakpoint.

          <br><dt><code>watchpoint</code><dd>Normal, explicitly set watchpoint.

          <br><dt><code>longjmp</code><dd>Internal breakpoint, used to handle correctly stepping through
<code>longjmp</code> calls.

          <br><dt><code>longjmp resume</code><dd>Internal breakpoint at the target of a <code>longjmp</code>.

          <br><dt><code>until</code><dd>Temporary internal breakpoint used by the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>until</code> command.

          <br><dt><code>finish</code><dd>Temporary internal breakpoint used by the <span class="sc">gdb</span> <code>finish</code> command.

          <br><dt><code>shlib events</code><dd>Shared library events.

     <p><a name="index-maint-info-bfds-3262"></a><br><dt><code>maint info bfds</code><dd>This prints information about each <code>bfd</code> object that is known to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  See <a href="bfd.html#Top">BFD</a>.

     <p><a name="index-maint-info-btrace-3263"></a><br><dt><code>maint info btrace</code><dd>Pint information about raw branch tracing data.

     <p><a name="index-maint-btrace-packet_002dhistory-3264"></a><br><dt><code>maint btrace packet-history</code><dd>Print the raw branch trace packets that are used to compute the
execution history for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">record btrace</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  Both the
information and the format in which it is printed depend on the btrace
recording format.

          <dl>
<dt><code>bts</code><dd>For the BTS recording format, print a list of blocks of sequential
code.  For each block, the following information is printed:

               <dl>
<dt>Block number<dd>Newer blocks have higher numbers.  The oldest block has number zero. 
<br><dt>Lowest &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PC</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>Highest &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PC</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd></dl>

          <br><dt><code>pt</code><dd>For the Intel(R) Processor Trace recording format, print a list of
Intel(R) Processor Trace packets.  For each packet, the following
information is printed:

               <dl>
<dt>Packet number<dd>Newer packets have higher numbers.  The oldest packet has number zero. 
<br><dt>Trace offset<dd>The packet's offset in the trace stream. 
<br><dt>Packet opcode and payload<dd></dl>
          </dl>

     <p><a name="index-maint-btrace-clear_002dpacket_002dhistory-3265"></a><br><dt><code>maint btrace clear-packet-history</code><dd>Discards the cached packet history printed by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">maint btrace
packet-history</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  The history will be computed again when
needed.

     <p><a name="index-maint-btrace-clear-3266"></a><br><dt><code>maint btrace clear</code><dd>Discard the branch trace data.  The data will be fetched anew and the
branch trace will be recomputed when needed.

     <p>This implicitly truncates the branch trace to a single branch trace
buffer.  When updating branch trace incrementally, the branch trace
available to <span class="sc">gdb</span> may be bigger than a single branch trace
buffer.

     <p><a name="index-maint-set-btrace-pt-skip_002dpad-3267"></a><br><dt><code>maint set btrace pt skip-pad</code><dd><a name="index-maint-show-btrace-pt-skip_002dpad-3268"></a><br><dt><code>maint show btrace pt skip-pad</code><dd>Control whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> will skip PAD packets when computing the

if the target supports it.  Displaced stepping is a way to single-step
over breakpoints without removing them from the inferior, by executing
an out-of-line copy of the instruction that was originally at the
breakpoint location.  It is also known as out-of-line single-stepping.

          <dl>
<dt><code>set displaced-stepping on</code><dd>If the target architecture supports it, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use
displaced stepping to step over breakpoints.

          <br><dt><code>set displaced-stepping off</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> will not use displaced stepping to step over breakpoints,
even if such is supported by the target architecture.

          <p><a name="index-non_002dstop-mode_002c-and-_0040samp_007bset-displaced_002dstepping_007d-3273"></a><br><dt><code>set displaced-stepping auto</code><dd>This is the default mode.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use displaced stepping
only if non-stop mode is active (see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) and the target
architecture supports displaced stepping. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-maint-check_002dpsymtabs-3274"></a><br><dt><code>maint check-psymtabs</code><dd>Check the consistency of currently expanded psymtabs versus symtabs. 
Use this to check, for example, whether a symbol is in one but not the other.

     <p><a name="index-maint-check_002dsymtabs-3275"></a><br><dt><code>maint check-symtabs</code><dd>Check the consistency of currently expanded symtabs.

     <p><a name="index-maint-expand_002dsymtabs-3276"></a><br><dt><code>maint expand-symtabs [</code><var>regexp</var><code>]</code><dd>Expand symbol tables. 
If <var>regexp</var> is specified, only expand symbol tables for file
names matching <var>regexp</var>.

     <p><a name="index-maint-set-catch_002ddemangler_002dcrashes-3277"></a><a name="index-maint-show-catch_002ddemangler_002dcrashes-3278"></a><a name="index-demangler-crashes-3279"></a><br><dt><code>maint set catch-demangler-crashes [on|off]</code><dt><code>maint show catch-demangler-crashes</code><dd>Control whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> should attempt to catch crashes in the
symbol name demangler.  The default is to attempt to catch crashes. 
If enabled, the first time a crash is caught, a core file is created,
the offending symbol is displayed and the user is presented with the
option to terminate the current session.

     <p><a name="index-maint-cplus-first_005fcomponent-3280"></a><br><dt><code>maint cplus first_component </code><var>name</var><dd>Print the first C<tt>++</tt> class/namespace component of <var>name</var>.

     <p><a name="index-maint-cplus-namespace-3281"></a><br><dt><code>maint cplus namespace</code><dd>Print the list of possible C<tt>++</tt> namespaces.

     <p><a name="index-maint-deprecate-3282"></a><a name="index-maint-undeprecate-3283"></a><a name="index-deprecated-commands-3284"></a><br><dt><code>maint deprecate </code><var>command</var> <span class="roman">[</span><var>replacement</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>maint undeprecate </code><var>command</var><dd>Deprecate or undeprecate the named <var>command</var>.  Deprecated commands
cause <span class="sc">gdb</span> to issue a warning when you use them.  The optional
argument <var>replacement</var> says which newer command should be used in
favor of the deprecated one; if it is given, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will mention
the replacement as part of the warning.

     <p><a name="index-maint-dump_002dme-3285"></a><br><dt><code>maint dump-me</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bSIGQUIT_007d-signal_002c-dump-core-of-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-3286"></a>Cause a fatal signal in the debugger and force it to dump its core. 
This is supported only on systems which support aborting a program
with the <code>SIGQUIT</code> signal.

     <p><a name="index-maint-internal_002derror-3287"></a><a name="index-maint-internal_002dwarning-3288"></a><a name="index-maint-demangler_002dwarning-3289"></a><a name="index-demangler-crashes-3290"></a><br><dt><code>maint internal-error </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>message-text</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>maint internal-warning </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>message-text</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>maint demangler-warning </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>message-text</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>
Cause <span class="sc">gdb</span> to call the internal function <code>internal_error</code>,
<code>internal_warning</code> or <code>demangler_warning</code> and hence behave
as though an internal problem has been detected.  In addition to
reporting the internal problem, these functions give the user the
opportunity to either quit <span class="sc">gdb</span> or (for <code>internal_error</code>
and <code>internal_warning</code>) create a core file of the current
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session.

     <p>These commands take an optional parameter <var>message-text</var> that is
used as the text of the error or warning message.

     <p>Here's an example of using <code>internal-error</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) <kbd>maint internal-error testing, 1, 2</kbd>
          .../maint.c:121: internal-error: testing, 1, 2
          A problem internal to GDB has been detected.  Further
          debugging may prove unreliable.
          Quit this debugging session? (y or n) <kbd>n</kbd>
          Create a core file? (y or n) <kbd>n</kbd>
          (gdb)

gives the user the opportunity to both quit <span class="sc">gdb</span> and create a
core file of the current <span class="sc">gdb</span> session.  These commands let you
override the default behaviour for each particular <var>action</var>,
described in the table below.

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quit</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You can specify that <span class="sc">gdb</span> should always (yes) or never (no)
quit.  The default is to ask the user what to do.

that there is no <code>corefile</code> option for <code>demangler-warning</code>:
demangler warnings always create a core file and this cannot be
disabled. 
</dl>

     <p><a name="index-maint-packet-3300"></a><br><dt><code>maint packet </code><var>text</var><dd>If <span class="sc">gdb</span> is talking to an inferior via the serial protocol,
then this command sends the string <var>text</var> to the inferior, and

a C source file.  The created source file can be used in <span class="sc">gdb</span>
when an XML parser is not available to parse the description.

     <p><a name="index-maint-print-dummy_002dframes-3303"></a><br><dt><code>maint print dummy-frames</code><dd>Prints the contents of <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s internal dummy-frame stack.

     <p>The command <code>maint print raw-registers</code> includes the contents of
the raw register cache; the command <code>maint print
cooked-registers</code> includes the (cooked) value of all registers,
including registers which aren't available on the target nor visible
to user; the command <code>maint print register-groups</code> includes the
groups that each register is a member of; and the command <code>maint
print remote-registers</code> includes the remote target's register numbers
and offsets in the `G' packets.

     <p>These commands take an optional parameter, a file name to which to
write the information.

     <p><a name="index-maint-print-statistics-3317"></a><a name="index-bcache-statistics-3318"></a><br><dt><code>maint print statistics</code><dd>This command prints, for each object file in the program, various data
about that object file followed by the byte cache (<dfn>bcache</dfn>)
statistics for the object file.  The objfile data includes the number
of minimal, partial, full, and stabs symbols, the number of types
defined by the objfile, the number of as yet unexpanded psym tables,
the number of line tables and string tables, and the amount of memory
used by the various tables.  The bcache statistics include the counts,
sizes, and counts of duplicates of all and unique objects, max,
average, and median entry size, total memory used and its overhead and

lengths.

     <p><a name="index-maint-print-target_002dstack-3319"></a><a name="index-target-stack-description-3320"></a><br><dt><code>maint print target-stack</code><dd>A <dfn>target</dfn> is an interface between the debugger and a particular

so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request. 
In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
address.

     <p>This command prints a short description of each layer that was pushed on
the <dfn>target stack</dfn>, starting from the top layer down to the bottom one.

information.

     <p>The default is <code>off</code>, which means that <span class="sc">gdb</span> should try to
describe a variable's location in an easily readable format.  When
<code>on</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will instead display the DWARF location
expression in an assembly-like format.  Note that some locations are
too complex for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to describe simply; in this case you will
always see the disassembly form.

     <p>Here is an example of the resulting disassembly:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info addr argc
          Symbol "argc" is a complex DWARF expression:

<h3 class="section">E.1 Overview</h3>

<p>There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol&mdash;for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>In the examples below, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; are used to indicate
transmitted and received data, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-protocol_002c-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-serial-3349"></a><a name="index-serial-protocol_002c-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-3350"></a><a name="index-remote-serial-protocol-3351"></a>All <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands and responses (other than acknowledgments
and notifications, see <a href="#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) are sent as a
<var>packet</var>.  A <var>packet</var> is introduced with the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, the actual <var>packet-data</var>, and the terminating character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a two-digit <var>checksum</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>$</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-checksum_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-3352"></a>The two-digit <var>checksum</var> is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and the trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; (an
eight bit unsigned checksum).

   <p>Implementors should note that prior to <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit <var>sequence-id</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>$</code><var>sequence-id</var><code>:</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-sequence_002did_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-3353"></a>That <var>sequence-id</var> was appended to the acknowledgment.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
has never output <var>sequence-id</var>s.  Stubs that handle packets added
since <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0 must not accept <var>sequence-id</var>.

   <p>When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgment: either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; (to request
retransmission):

<pre class="smallexample">     -&gt; <code>$</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
     &lt;- <code>+</code>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgments can be disabled
once a connection is established. 
See <a href="#Packet-Acknowledgment">Packet Acknowledgment</a>, for details.

   <p>The host (<span class="sc">gdb</span>) sends <var>command</var>s, and the target (the
debugging stub incorporated in your program) sends a <var>response</var>.  In
the case of step and continue <var>command</var>s, the response is only sent
when the operation has completed, and the target has again stopped all
threads in all attached processes.  This is the default all-stop mode
behavior, but the remote protocol also supports <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s non-stop
execution mode; see <a href="#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>, for details.

   <p><var>packet-data</var> consists of a sequence of characters with the
exception of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; (see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; packet for additional
exceptions).

   <p><a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-field-separator-3354"></a>Fields within the packet should be separated using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in
<span class="sc">hex</span> with leading zeros suppressed.

   <p>Implementors should note that prior to <span class="sc">gdb</span> 5.0, the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it
would potentially conflict with the <var>sequence-id</var>).

   <p><a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-binary-data-3355"></a><a name="Binary-Data"></a>Binary data in most packets is encoded either as two hexadecimal
digits per byte of binary data.  This allowed the traditional remote
protocol to work over connections which were only seven-bit clean. 
Some packets designed more recently assume an eight-bit clean
connection, and use a more efficient encoding to send and receive
binary data.

   <p>The binary data representation uses <code>7d</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;)
as an escape character.  Any escaped byte is transmitted as the escape
character followed by the original character XORed with <code>0x20</code>. 
For example, the byte <code>0x7d</code> would be transmitted as the two
bytes <code>0x7d 0x5d</code>.  The bytes <code>0x23</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;),
<code>0x24</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;), and <code>0x7d</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;) must always be escaped.  Responses sent by the stub
must also escape <code>0x2a</code> (<span class="sc">ascii</span> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;), so that it
is not interpreted as the start of a run-length encoded sequence
(described next).

   <p>Response <var>data</var> can be run-length encoded to save space. 
Run-length encoding replaces runs of identical characters with one
instance of the repeated character, followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and a
repeat count.  The repeat count is itself sent encoded, to avoid
binary characters in <var>data</var>: a value of <var>n</var> is sent as
<var>n</var><code>+29</code>.  For a repeat count greater or equal to 3, this
produces a printable <span class="sc">ascii</span> character, e.g. a space (<span class="sc">ascii</span>
code 32) for a repeat count of 3.  (This is because run-length
encoding starts to win for counts 3 or more.)  Thus, for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0* </span></samp>&rsquo; is a run-length encoding of &ldquo;0000&rdquo;: the space character
after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; means repeat the leading <code>0</code> <code>32&nbsp;-&nbsp;29&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</code><!-- /@w --> more times.

   <p>The printable characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; or with a numeric value
greater than 126 must not be used.  Runs of six repeats (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) or
seven repeats (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;) can be expanded using a repeat count of only
five (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;).  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">00000000</span></samp>&rsquo; can be encoded as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0*"00</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number.  That number is not well defined.

   <p><a name="index-empty-response_002c-for-unsupported-packets-3356"></a>For any <var>command</var> not supported by the stub, an empty response
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$#00</span></samp>&rsquo;) should be returned.  That way it is possible to extend the
protocol.  A newer <span class="sc">gdb</span> can tell if a packet is supported based
on that response.

   <p>At a minimum, a stub is required to support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo;
commands for register access, and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; commands
for memory access.  Stubs that only control single-threaded targets
can implement run control with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; (continue), and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;
(step) commands.  Stubs that support multi-threading targets should
support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vCont</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  All other commands are optional.

<h3 class="section">E.2 Packets</h3>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
<var>command</var>s and their corresponding response <var>data</var>. 
See <a href="#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for details about the File
I/O extension of the remote protocol.

   <p>Each packet's description has a template showing the packet's overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet's meaning.  We
include spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not
part of the packet's syntax.  No <span class="sc">gdb</span> packet uses spaces to
separate its components.  For example, a template like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo
</span><var>bar</var> <var>baz</var></samp>&rsquo; describes a packet beginning with the three ASCII
bytes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, followed by a <var>bar</var>, followed directly by a
<var>baz</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not transmit a space character between the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; and the <var>bar</var>, or between the <var>bar</var> and the
<var>baz</var>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040var_007bthread_002did_007d_002c-in-remote-protocol-3357"></a><a name="thread_002did-syntax"></a>Several packets and replies include a <var>thread-id</var> field to identify
a thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A <var>thread-id</var>
can also be a literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate all threads, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; to
pick any thread.

   <p>In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the <var>thread-id</var> syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>tid</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
The <var>pid</var> (process) and <var>tid</var> (thread) components each have the
format described above: a positive number with target-specific
interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex string, literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo;
to indicate all processes or threads (respectively), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; to
indicate an arbitrary process or thread.  Specifying just a process, as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var></samp>&rsquo;, is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It is an
error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p-1.</span><var>tid</var></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix is <em>not</em> used
for those packets and replies explicitly documented to include a process
ID, rather than a <var>thread-id</var>.

   <p>The multiprocess <var>thread-id</var> syntax extensions are only used if both
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and the stub report support for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess</span></samp>&rsquo;
feature using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>, for
more information.

   <p>Note that all packet forms beginning with an upper- or lower-case
letter, other than those described here, are reserved for future use.

   <p>Here are the packet descriptions.

     <p>The exact effect of this packet is not specified.

     <p>For a bare-metal target, it may power cycle or reset the target
system.  For that reason, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; packet has no reply.

     <p>For a single-process target, it may kill that process if possible.

     <p>A multiple-process target may choose to kill just one process, or all
that are under <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s control.  For more precise control, use
the vKill packet (see <a href="#vKill-packet">vKill packet</a>).

     <p>If the target system immediately closes the connection in response to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo;, <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not consider the lack of packet
acknowledgment to be an error, and assumes the kill was successful.

     <p>If connected using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>, and the target does
not close the connection in response to a kill request, <span class="sc">gdb</span>
probes the target state as if a new connection was opened
(see <a href="#g_t_003f-packet">? packet</a>).

          <p>If the range is empty (<var>start</var> == <var>end</var>), then the action

the corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has stopped with

<var>addr</var> of type <var>kind</var>.

     <p>A memory breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at
<var>addr</var> with a software breakpoint or trap instruction.  The
<var>kind</var> is target-specific and typically indicates the size of
the breakpoint in bytes that should be inserted.  E.g., the <span class="sc">arm</span>
and <span class="sc">mips</span> can insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint.  Some
architectures have additional meanings for <var>kind</var>;
<var>cond_list</var> is an optional list of conditional expressions in bytecode
form that should be evaluated on the target's side.  These are the
conditions that should be taken into consideration when deciding if
the breakpoint trigger should be reported back to <var>GDBN</var>.

     <p>See also the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">swbreak</span></samp>&rsquo; stop reason (see <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>)
for how to best report a memory breakpoint event to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>The <var>cond_list</var> parameter is comprised of a series of expressions,
concatenated without separators. Each expression has the following form:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the
actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     </dl>

     <p>The optional <var>cmd_list</var> parameter introduces commands that may be
run on the target, rather than being reported back to <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
The parameter starts with a numeric flag <var>persist</var>; if the flag is
nonzero, then the breakpoint may remain active and the commands
continue to be run even when <span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnects from the target. 
Following this flag is a series of expressions concatenated with no
separators.  Each expression has the following form:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the
actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     </dl>

     <p>see <a href="#Architecture_002dSpecific-Protocol-Details">Architecture-Specific Protocol Details</a>.

     <p><em>Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
code that contains memory breakpoints (e.g., when implementing
overlays).  The behavior of this packet, in the presence of such a
target, is not defined.</em>

round-trip latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported
this way.  Each &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>r</var></samp>&rsquo; pair is interpreted as follows:

          <ul>
<li>If <var>n</var> is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the

two-digit hex number.

          <li>If <var>n</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo;, then <var>r</var> is the <var>thread-id</var> of

<h3 class="section">E.4 General Query Packets</h3>

<p><a name="index-remote-query-requests-3421"></a>
Packets starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; are <dfn>general query packets</dfn>;
packets starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Q</span></samp>&rsquo; are <dfn>general set packets</dfn>.  General
query and set packets are a semi-unified form for retrieving and
sending information to and from the stub.

   <p>The initial letter of a query or set packet is followed by a name
indicating what sort of thing the packet applies to.  For example,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may use a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSymbol</span></samp>&rsquo; packet to exchange symbol
definitions with the stub.  These packet names follow some
conventions:

     <ul>
<li>The name must not contain commas, colons or semicolons. 
<li>Most <span class="sc">gdb</span> query and set packets have a leading upper case
letter. 
<li>The names of custom vendor packets should use a company prefix, in
lower case, followed by a period.  For example, packets designed at
the Acme Corporation might begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qacme.foo</span></samp>&rsquo; (for querying
foos) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Qacme.bar</span></samp>&rsquo; (for setting bars). 
</ul>

   <p>The name of a query or set packet should be separated from any
parameters by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;; the parameters themselves should be
separated by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Stubs must be careful to match the
full packet name, and check for a separator or the end of the packet,
in case two packet names share a common prefix.  New packets should not begin
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qC</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qP</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qL</span></samp>&rsquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-19" name="fnd-19"><sup>19</sup></a>.

   <p>Like the descriptions of the other packets, each description here
has a template showing the packet's overall syntax, followed by an
explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include spaces in some of the
templates for clarity; these are not part of the packet's syntax.  No
<span class="sc">gdb</span> packet uses spaces to separate its components.

   <p>Here are the currently defined query and set packets:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QAgent:1</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QAgent:0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Turn on or off the agent as a helper to perform some debugging operations
delegated from <span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="#Control-Agent">Control Agent</a>).

target, as a semicolon-separated list of operation name and value
pairs.  Possible values for <var>op</var> include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">WriteReg</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">WriteMem</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">InsertBreak</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">InsertTrace</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">InsertFastTrace</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>&rsquo;. <var>val</var> is either 0,
indicating that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not request the operation, or 1,
indicating that it may.  (The target can then use this to set up its
own internals optimally, for instance if the debugger never expects to
insert breakpoints, it may not need to install its own trap handler.)

     <p><em>Note:</em> This is the same CRC used in validating separate debug
files (see <a href="#Separate-Debug-Files">Debugging Information in Separate Files</a>).  However the algorithm is slightly different.  When validating
separate debug files, the CRC is computed taking the <em>least</em>
significant bit of each byte first, and the final result is inverted to
detect trailing zeros.

of 1 directs the target to disable address space randomization for
processes subsequently started via &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vRun</span></samp>&rsquo; packets, while a packet
with a <var>value</var> of 0 tells the target to enable address space
randomization.

Since there
may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet, this query
works iteratively: it may require more than one query/reply sequence to
obtain the entire list of threads.  The first query of the sequence will
be the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qfThreadInfo</span></samp>&rsquo; query; subsequent queries in the
sequence will be the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qsThreadInfo</span></samp>&rsquo; query.

     <p>NOTE: This packet replaces the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qL</span></samp>&rsquo; query (see below).

</dl>

     <p>In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one or
more thread IDs, separated by commas. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will respond to each reply with a request for more thread
ids (using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qs</span></samp>&rsquo; form of the query), until the target responds
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>&rsquo; (lower-case ell, for <dfn>last</dfn>). 
Refer to <a href="#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>, for the format of the <var>thread-id</var>
fields.

     <p><em>Note: </em><span class="sc">gdb</span><em> will send the </em><code>qfThreadInfo</code><em> query during the
initial connection with the remote target, and the very first thread ID
mentioned in the reply will be stopped by </em><span class="sc">gdb</span><em> in a subsequent

the </em><code>qfThreadInfo</code><em> reply is suitable for being stopped by </em><span class="sc">gdb</span><em>.</em>

     <p><var>offset</var> is the (big endian, hex encoded) offset associated with the
thread local variable.  (This offset is obtained from the debug
information associated with the variable.)

     <p><var>lm</var> is the (big endian, hex encoded) OS/ABI-specific encoding of the
load module associated with the thread local storage.  For example,
a <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux system will pass the link map address of the shared
object associated with the thread local storage under consideration. 
Other operating environments may choose to represent the load module
differently, so the precise meaning of this parameter will vary.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>stubfeature</var><span class="samp"> [;</span><var>stubfeature</var><span class="samp">]...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The stub supports or does not support each returned <var>stubfeature</var>,
depending on the form of each <var>stubfeature</var> (see below for the
possible forms). 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"><!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>An empty reply indicates that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; is not recognized,
or that no features needed to be reported to <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
</dl>

     <p>The allowed forms for each feature (either a <var>gdbfeature</var> in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; packet, or a <var>stubfeature</var> in the response)
are:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">=</span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is supported, and associated
with the specified <var>value</var>.  The format of <var>value</var> depends
on the feature, but it must not include a semicolon. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is supported, and does not

<span class="sc">gdb</span> should auto-detect support in some other way when it is
needed.  This form will not be used for <var>gdbfeature</var> notifications,
but may be used for <var>stubfeature</var> responses. 
</dl>

     <p>Whenever the stub receives a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; request, the
supplied set of <span class="sc">gdb</span> features should override any previous
request.  This allows <span class="sc">gdb</span> to put the stub in a known
state, even if the stub had previously been communicating with
a different version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>The following values of <var>gdbfeature</var> (for the packet sent by <span class="sc">gdb</span>)
are defined:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports multiprocess
extensions to the remote protocol.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not use such
extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them by
including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess+</span></samp>&rsquo; in its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; reply. 
See <a href="#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>, for details.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xmlRegisters</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates that <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports the XML target
description.  If the stub sees &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xmlRegisters=</span></samp>&rsquo; with target
specific strings separated by a comma, it will report register
description.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn</span></samp>&rsquo; packet (see <a href="#Tracepoint-Packets">Relocate instruction reply packet</a>).

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">swbreak</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports the swbreak stop
reason in stop replies.  See <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>, for details.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hwbreak</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports the hwbreak stop
reason in stop replies.  See <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>, for details.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fork-events</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports fork event
extensions to the remote protocol.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not use such
extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them by
including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fork-events+</span></samp>&rsquo; in its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; reply.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfork-events</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This feature indicates whether <span class="sc">gdb</span> supports vfork event
extensions to the remote protocol.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not use such
extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them by
including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vfork-events+</span></samp>&rsquo; in its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; reply. 
</dl>

     <p>Stubs should ignore any unknown values for
<var>gdbfeature</var>.  Any <span class="sc">gdb</span> which sends a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo;
packet supports receiving packets of unlimited length (earlier
versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> may reject overly long responses).  Additional values
for <var>gdbfeature</var> may be defined in the future to let the stub take
advantage of new features in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, e.g. incompatible
improvements in the remote protocol&mdash;the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess</span></samp>&rsquo; feature is
an example of such a feature.  The stub's reply should be independent
of the <var>gdbfeature</var> entries sent by <span class="sc">gdb</span>; first <span class="sc">gdb</span>
describes all the features it supports, and then the stub replies with
all the features it supports.

     <p>Similarly, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will silently ignore unrecognized stub feature
responses, as long as each response uses one of the standard forms.

     <p>Some features are flags.  A stub which supports a flag feature
should respond with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; form response.  Other features
require values, and the stub should respond with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
form response.

     <p>Each feature has a default value, which <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; is not available or if the feature is not mentioned
in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; response.  The default values are fixed; a
stub is free to omit any feature responses that match the defaults.

     <p>Not all features can be probed, but for those which can, the probing
mechanism is useful: in some cases, a stub's internal
architecture may not allow the protocol layer to know some information
about the underlying target in advance.  This is especially common in
stubs which may be configured for multiple targets.

     <p>These are the currently defined stub features and their properties:

by a comma and hex-encoded bytes, in a manner similar to action
encodings as described below.  If the trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is present,
further &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets will follow to specify this tracepoint's

another &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packet that ended with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the
trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is present, further &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets will follow,
specifying more actions for this tracepoint.

     <p>In the series of action packets for a given tracepoint, at most one
can have an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; before its first <var>action</var>.  If such a packet
is sent, it and the following packets define &ldquo;while-stepping&rdquo;
actions.  Any prior packets define ordinary actions &mdash; that is, those
taken when the tracepoint is first hit.  If no action packet has an
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;, then all the packets in the series specify ordinary
tracepoint actions.

     <p>The &lsquo;<samp><var>action</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; portion of the packet is a series of
actions, concatenated without separators.  Each action has one of the
following forms:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R </span><var>mask</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Collect the registers whose bits are set in <var>mask</var>,
a hexadecimal number whose <var>i</var>'th bit is set if register number
<var>i</var> should be collected.  (The least significant bit is numbered
zero.)  Note that <var>mask</var> may be any number of digits long; it may
not fit in a 32-bit word.

number <var>basereg</var>, plus <var>offset</var>.  If <var>basereg</var> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the range has a fixed address: <var>offset</var> is the
address of the lowest byte to collect.  The <var>basereg</var>,
<var>offset</var>, and <var>len</var> parameters are all unsigned hexadecimal
values (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>&rsquo; value for <var>basereg</var> is a special case).

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Evaluate <var>expr</var>, whose length is <var>len</var>, and collect memory as
it directs.  The agent expression <var>expr</var> is as described in
<a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>.  Each byte of the expression is encoded as a
two-digit hex number in the packet; <var>len</var> is the number of bytes
in the expression (and thus one-half the number of hex digits in the
packet).

     </dl>

     <p>Any number of actions may be packed together in a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo;
packet, as long as the packet does not exceed the maximum packet
length (400 bytes, for many stubs).  There may be only one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;
action per tracepoint, and it must precede any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo;
actions.  Any registers referred to by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; actions
must be collected by a preceding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; action.  (The
&ldquo;while-stepping&rdquo; actions are treated as if they were attached to a
separate tracepoint, as far as these restrictions are concerned.)

This is useful to get accurate reproduction of the tracepoints
originally downloaded at the beginning of the trace run.  The <var>type</var>
is the name of the tracepoint part, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cond</span></samp>&rsquo; for the
tracepoint's conditional expression (see below for a list of types), while
<var>bytes</var> is the string, encoded in hexadecimal.

     <p><var>start</var> is the offset of the <var>bytes</var> within the overall source
string, while <var>slen</var> is the total length of the source string. 
This is intended for handling source strings that are longer than will
fit in a single packet. 
<!-- Add detailed example when this info is moved into a dedicated -->
<!-- tracepoint descriptions section. -->

     <p>The available string types are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">at</span></samp>&rsquo; for the location,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cond</span></samp>&rsquo; for the conditional, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cmd</span></samp>&rsquo; for an action command. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sends a separate packet for each command in the action
list, in the same order in which the commands are stored in the list.

     <p>The target does not need to do anything with source strings except
report them back as part of the replies to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTfP</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTsP</span></samp>&rsquo;
query packets.

     <p>Although this packet is optional, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> will only send it
if the target replies with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TracepointSource</span></samp>&rsquo; See <a href="#General-Query-Packets">General Query Packets</a>, it makes both disconnected tracing and trace files
much easier to use.  Otherwise the user must be careful that the
tracepoints in effect while looking at trace frames are identical to
the ones in effect during the trace run; even a small discrepancy
could cause &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tdump</span></samp>&rsquo; not to work, or a particular trace frame not
be found.

the option of not using this packet for initial values of zero; the
target should simply create the trace state variables as they are
mentioned in expressions.  The value <var>builtin</var> should be 1 (one)
if the trace state variable is builtin and 0 (zero) if it is not builtin. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> only sets <var>builtin</var> to 1 if a previous &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qTfV</span></samp>&rsquo; or

it depends on the target system being able to create trampolines in

     <p>If the trace is not running, the agent may report any of several
explanations as one of the optional fields:

<h4 class="subsection">E.6.1 Relocate instruction reply packet</h4>

<p>When installing fast tracepoints in memory, the target may need to
relocate the instruction currently at the tracepoint address to a
different address in memory.  For most instructions, a simple copy is
enough, but, for example, call instructions that implicitly push the
return address on the stack, and relative branches or other
PC-relative instructions require offset adjustment, so that the effect
of executing the instruction at a different address is the same as if
it had executed in the original location.

   <p>In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may also
respond with a number of intermediate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn</span></samp>&rsquo; request
packets before the final result packet, to have <span class="sc">gdb</span> handle
this relocation operation.  If a packet supports this mechanism, its
documentation will explicitly say so.  See for example the above
descriptions for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTStart</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QTDP</span></samp>&rsquo; packets.  The
format of the request is:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qRelocInsn:</span><var>from</var><span class="samp">;</span><var>to</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
This requests <span class="sc">gdb</span> to copy instruction at address <var>from</var>
to address <var>to</var>, possibly adjusted so that executing the
instruction at <var>to</var> has the same effect as executing it at
<var>from</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> writes the adjusted instruction to target

<h3 class="section">E.7 Host I/O Packets</h3>

<p><a name="index-Host-I_002fO_002c-remote-protocol-3503"></a><a name="index-file-transfer_002c-remote-protocol-3504"></a>
The <dfn>Host I/O</dfn> packets allow <span class="sc">gdb</span> to perform I/O
operations on the far side of a remote link.  For example, Host I/O is
used to upload and download files to a remote target with its own
filesystem.  Host I/O uses the same constant values and data structure
layout as the target-initiated File-I/O protocol.  However, the
Host I/O packets are structured differently.  The target-initiated
protocol relies on target memory to store parameters and buffers. 
Host I/O requests are initiated by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and the
target's memory is not involved.  See <a href="#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for more details on the target-initiated protocol.

   <p>The Host I/O request packets all encode a single operation along with
its arguments.  They have this format:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vFile:</span><var>operation</var><span class="samp">: </span><var>parameter</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>operation</var> is the name of the particular request; the target
should compare the entire packet name up to the second colon when checking
for a supported operation.  The format of <var>parameter</var> depends on
the operation.  Numbers are always passed in hexadecimal.  Negative
numbers have an explicit minus sign (i.e. two's complement is not
used).  Strings (e.g. filenames) are encoded as a series of
hexadecimal bytes.  The last argument to a system call may be a
buffer of escaped binary data (see <a href="#Binary-Data">Binary Data</a>).

   </dl>

   <p>The valid responses to Host I/O packets are:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F </span><var>result</var><span class="samp"> [, </span><var>errno</var><span class="samp">] [; </span><var>attachment</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><var>result</var> is the integer value returned by this operation, usually
non-negative for success and -1 for errors.  If an error has occured,
<var>errno</var> will be included in the result specifying a
value defined by the File-I/O protocol (see <a href="#Errno-Values">Errno Values</a>).  For
operations which return data, <var>attachment</var> supplies the data as a
binary buffer.  Binary buffers in response packets are escaped in the
normal way (see <a href="#Binary-Data">Binary Data</a>).  See the individual packet
documentation for the interpretation of <var>result</var> and
<var>attachment</var>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"><!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>An empty response indicates that this operation is not recognized.

return -1 if an error occurs.  The <var>filename</var> is a string,
<var>flags</var> is an integer indicating a mask of open flags
(see <a href="#Open-Flags">Open Flags</a>), and <var>mode</var> is an integer indicating a mask
of mode bits to use if the file is created (see <a href="#mode_005ft-Values">mode_t Values</a>). 
See <a href="#open">open</a>, for details of the open flags and mode values.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vFile:close: </span><var>fd</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Close the open file corresponding to <var>fd</var> and return 0, or

<var>count</var> bytes will be read from the file, starting at <var>offset</var>
relative to the start of the file.  The target may read fewer bytes;
common reasons include packet size limits and an end-of-file
condition.  The number of bytes read is returned.  Zero should only be
returned for a successful read at the end of the file, or if
<var>count</var> was zero.

     <p>The data read should be returned as a binary attachment on success. 
If zero bytes were read, the response should include an empty binary
attachment (i.e. a trailing semicolon).  The return value is the
number of target bytes read; the binary attachment may be longer if
some characters were escaped.

packet is used.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vFile:write</span></samp>&rsquo; returns the number of bytes written,

<h3 class="section">E.8 Interrupts</h3>

<p><a name="index-interrupts-_0028remote-protocol_0029-3505"></a>
When a program on the remote target is running, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may
attempt to interrupt it by sending a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-C</span></samp>&rsquo;, <code>BREAK</code> or
a <code>BREAK</code> followed by <code>g</code>,
control of which is specified via <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">interrupt-sequence</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The precise meaning of <code>BREAK</code> is defined by the transport
mechanism and may, in fact, be undefined.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not
currently define a <code>BREAK</code> mechanism for any of the network
interfaces except for TCP, in which case <span class="sc">gdb</span> sends the
<code>telnet</code> BREAK sequence.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-C</span></samp>&rsquo;, on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all
transport mechanisms.  It is represented by sending the single byte
<code>0x03</code> without any of the usual packet overhead described in
the Overview section (see <a href="#Overview">Overview</a>).  When a <code>0x03</code> byte is
transmitted as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data
and does <em>not</em> represent an interrupt.  E.g., an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; packet
(see <a href="#X-packet">X packet</a>), used for binary downloads, may include an unescaped
<code>0x03</code> as part of its packet.

   <p><code>BREAK</code> followed by <code>g</code> is also known as Magic SysRq g. 
When Linux kernel receives this sequence from serial port,
it stops execution and connects to gdb.

   <p>Stubs are not required to recognize these interrupt mechanisms and the
precise meaning associated with receipt of the interrupt is
implementation defined.  If the target supports debugging of multiple
threads and/or processes, it should attempt to interrupt all
currently-executing threads and processes. 
If the stub is successful at interrupting the
running program, it should send one of the stop
reply packets (see <a href="#Stop-Reply-Packets">Stop Reply Packets</a>) to <span class="sc">gdb</span> as a result
of successfully stopping the program in all-stop mode, and a stop reply
for each stopped thread in non-stop mode. 
Interrupts received while the
program is stopped are discarded.

The <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote serial protocol includes <dfn>notifications</dfn>,
packets that require no acknowledgment.  Both the GDB and the stub
may send notifications (although the only notifications defined at
present are sent by the stub).  Notifications carry information
without incurring the round-trip latency of an acknowledgment, and so
are useful for low-impact communications where occasional packet loss
is not a problem.

   <p>A notification packet has the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">% </span><var>data</var><span class="samp"> #
</span><var>checksum</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>data</var> is the content of the notification,
and <var>checksum</var> is a checksum of <var>data</var>, computed and formatted
as for ordinary <span class="sc">gdb</span> packets.  A notification's <var>data</var>
never contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; characters.  Upon
receiving a notification, the recipient sends no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;
to acknowledge the notification's receipt or to report its corruption.

   <p>Every notification's <var>data</var> begins with a name, which contains no
colon characters, followed by a colon character.

   <p>Recipients should silently ignore corrupted notifications and
notifications they do not understand.  Recipients should restart
timeout periods on receipt of a well-formed notification, whether or
not they understand it.

   <p>Senders should only send the notifications described here when this
protocol description specifies that they are permitted.  In the
future, we may extend the protocol to permit existing notifications in
new contexts; this rule helps older senders avoid confusing newer
recipients.

   <p>(Older versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> ignore bytes received until they see
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; byte that begins an ordinary packet, so new stubs may
transmit notifications without fear of confusing older clients.  There
are no notifications defined for <span class="sc">gdb</span> to send at the moment, but we
assume that most older stubs would ignore them, as well.)

   <p>Each notification is comprised of three parts:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>event</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The notification packet is sent by the side that initiates the
exchange (currently, only the stub does that), with <var>event</var>
carrying the specific information about the notification, and
<var>name</var> specifying the name of the notification. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>ack</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The acknowledge sent by the other side, usually <span class="sc">gdb</span>, to
acknowledge the exchange and request the event. 
</dl>

   <p>The purpose of an asynchronous notification mechanism is to report to
<span class="sc">gdb</span> that something interesting happened in the remote stub.

   <p>The remote stub may send notification <var>name</var>:<var>event</var>
at any time, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> acknowledges the notification when
appropriate.  The notification event is pending before <span class="sc">gdb</span>
acknowledges.  Only one notification at a time may be pending; if
additional events occur before <span class="sc">gdb</span> has acknowledged the
previous notification, they must be queued by the stub for later
synchronous transmission in response to <var>ack</var> packets from
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Because the notification mechanism is unreliable,
the stub is permitted to resend a notification if it believes
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may not have received it.

   <p>Specifically, notifications may appear when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is not
otherwise reading input from the stub, or when <span class="sc">gdb</span> is
expecting to read a normal synchronous response or a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgment to a packet it has sent. 
Notification packets are distinct from any other communication from
the stub so there is no ambiguity.

   <p>After receiving a notification, <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall acknowledge it by
sending a <var>ack</var> packet as a regular, synchronous request to the
stub.  Such acknowledgment is not required to happen immediately, as
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is permitted to send other, unrelated packets to the
stub first, which the stub should process normally.

   <p>Upon receiving a <var>ack</var> packet, if the stub has other queued
events to report to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, it shall respond by sending a
normal <var>event</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall then send another <var>ack</var>
packet to solicit further responses; again, it is permitted to send
other, unrelated packets as well which the stub should process
normally.

   <p>If the stub receives a <var>ack</var> packet and there are no additional
<var>event</var> to report, the stub shall return an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>&rsquo; response. 
At this point, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has finished processing a notification
and the stub has completed sending any queued events.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
won't accept any new notifications until the final &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>&rsquo; is
received .  If further notification events occur, the stub shall send
a new notification, <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall accept the notification, and
the process shall be repeated.

   <p>The process of asynchronous notification can be illustrated by the
following example:
<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;- <code>%%Stop:T0505:98e7ffbf;04:4ce6ffbf;08:b1b6e54c;thread:p7526.7526;core:0;</code>

     &lt;- <code>T0505:68e3fdb6;04:40e3fdb6;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7529;core:0;</code>
     -&gt; <code>vStopped</code>
     &lt;- <code>OK</code>
</pre>

<h3 class="section">E.10 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of
multi-threaded programs, as described in <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  If the stub
supports non-stop mode, it should report that to <span class="sc">gdb</span> by including
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QNonStop+</span></samp>&rsquo; in its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo; response (see <a href="#qSupported">qSupported</a>).

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> typically sends a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QNonStop</span></samp>&rsquo; packet only when
establishing a new connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode
does not alter the state of any currently-running threads, but targets
must stop all threads in any already-attached processes when entering
all-stop mode.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; packet as necessary to
probe the target state after a mode change.

   <p>In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the
asynchronous notification mechanism (see <a href="#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) to
inform <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  In contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads
in all processes are stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop
mode only the thread reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is,
when reporting a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo; response to indicate completion
of a step operation, hitting a breakpoint, or a fault, only the
affected thread is stopped; any other still-running threads continue
to run.  When reporting a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; response, all running
threads belonging to other attached processes continue to run.

   <p>In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>&rsquo;
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new
sequence reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not
it has previously reported those events to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  The first
stop reply is sent as a synchronous reply to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; packet, and
subsequent stop replies are sent as responses to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>&rsquo; packets
using the mechanism described above.  The target must not send
asynchronous stop reply notifications until the sequence is complete. 
If all threads are running when the target receives the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; packet,
or if the target is not attached to any process, it shall respond
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If the stub supports non-stop mode, it should also support the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">swbreak</span></samp>&rsquo; stop reason if software breakpoints are supported, and
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hwbreak</span></samp>&rsquo; stop reason if hardware breakpoints are supported
(see <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>).  This is because given the asynchronous
nature of non-stop mode, between the time a thread hits a breakpoint
and the time the event is finally processed by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the
breakpoint may have already been removed from the target.  Due to
this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to be able to tell whether a trap stop was
caused by a delayed breakpoint event, which should be ignored, as
opposed to a random trap signal, which should be reported to the user. 
Note the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">swbreak</span></samp>&rsquo; feature implies that the target is responsible
for adjusting the PC when a software breakpoint triggers, if
necessary, such as on the x86 architecture.

the first response expected is an acknowledgment: either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; (to request retransmission). 
This mechanism allows the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote protocol to operate over
unreliable transport mechanisms, such as a serial line.

   <p>In cases where the transport mechanism is itself reliable (such as a pipe or
TCP connection), the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgments are redundant. 
It may be desirable to disable them in that case to reduce communication
overhead, or for other reasons.  This can be accomplished by means of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>&rsquo; packet; see <a href="#QStartNoAckMode">QStartNoAckMode</a>.

   <p>When in no-acknowledgment mode, neither the stub nor <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall send or
expect &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; protocol acknowledgments.  The packet
and response format still includes the normal checksum, as described in
<a href="#Overview">Overview</a>, but the checksum may be ignored by the receiver.

   <p>If the stub supports &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>&rsquo; and prefers to operate in
no-acknowledgment mode, it should report that to <span class="sc">gdb</span>
by including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode+</span></samp>&rsquo; in its response to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>&rsquo;;
see <a href="#qSupported">qSupported</a>. 
If <span class="sc">gdb</span> also supports &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>&rsquo; and it has not been
disabled via the <code>set remote noack-packet off</code> command
(see <a href="#Remote-Configuration">Remote Configuration</a>),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may then send a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>&rsquo; packet to the stub. 
Only then may the stub actually turn off packet acknowledgments. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sends a final &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgment of the stub's &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>&rsquo;
response, which can be safely ignored by the stub.

   <p>Note that <code>set remote noack-packet</code> command only affects negotiation
between <span class="sc">gdb</span> and the stub when subsequent connections are made;
it does not affect the protocol acknowledgment state for any current
connection. 
Since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; acknowledgments are enabled by default when a
new connection is established,
there is also no protocol request to re-enable the acknowledgments
for the current connection, once disabled.

<h4 class="subsection">E.13.1 File-I/O Overview</h4>

<p><a name="index-file_002di_002fo-overview-3511"></a>
The <dfn>File I/O remote protocol extension</dfn> (short: File-I/O) allows the
target to use the host's file system and console I/O to perform various
system calls.  System calls on the target system are translated into a
remote protocol packet to the host system, which then performs the needed
actions and returns a response packet to the target system. 
This simulates file system operations even on targets that lack file systems.

   <p>The protocol is defined to be independent of both the host and target systems. 
It uses its own internal representation of datatypes and values.  Both
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and the target's <span class="sc">gdb</span> stub are responsible for
translating the system-dependent value representations into the internal
protocol representations when data is transmitted.

   <p>The communication is synchronous.  A system call is possible only when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is waiting for a response from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; packets.  While <span class="sc">gdb</span> handles the request for a system call,
the target is stopped to allow deterministic access to the target's
memory.  Therefore File-I/O is not interruptible by target signals.  On
the other hand, it is possible to interrupt File-I/O by a user interrupt
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-C</span></samp>&rsquo;) within <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

   <p>The target's request to perform a host system call does not finish
the latest &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; action.  That means,
after finishing the system call, the target returns to continuing the
previous activity (continue, step).  No additional continue or step
request from <span class="sc">gdb</span> is required.

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) continue
       &lt;- target requests 'system call X'
       target is stopped, <span class="sc">gdb</span> executes system call
       -&gt; <span class="sc">gdb</span> returns result
       ... target continues, <span class="sc">gdb</span> returns to wait for the target
       &lt;- target hits breakpoint and sends a Txx packet
</pre>
   <p>The protocol only supports I/O on the console and to regular files on
the host file system.  Character or block special devices, pipes,
named pipes, sockets or any other communication method on the host
system are not supported by this protocol.

   <p>File I/O is not supported in non-stop mode.

<h4 class="subsection">E.13.2 Protocol Basics</h4>

<p><a name="index-protocol-basics_002c-file_002di_002fo-3512"></a>
The File-I/O protocol uses the <code>F</code> packet as the request as well
as reply packet.  Since a File-I/O system call can only occur when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is waiting for a response from the continuing or stepping target,
the File-I/O request is a reply that <span class="sc">gdb</span> has to expect as a result
of a previous &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; packet. 
This <code>F</code> packet contains all information needed to allow <span class="sc">gdb</span>
to call the appropriate host system call:

     <ul>
<li>A unique identifier for the requested system call.

     <li>All parameters to the system call.  Pointers are given as addresses
in the target memory address space.  Pointers to strings are given as
pointer/length pair.  Numerical values are given as they are. 
Numerical control flags are given in a protocol-specific representation.

   </ul>

   <p>At this point, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has to perform the following actions.

     <ul>
<li>If the parameters include pointer values to data needed as input to a
system call, <span class="sc">gdb</span> requests this data from the target with a
standard <code>m</code> packet request.  This additional communication has to be
expected by the target implementation and is handled as any other <code>m</code>
packet.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> translates all value from protocol representation to host
representation as needed.  Datatypes are coerced into the host types.

     <li><span class="sc">gdb</span> calls the system call.

     <li>It then coerces datatypes back to protocol representation.

     <li>If the system call is expected to return data in buffer space specified
by pointer parameters to the call, the data is transmitted to the
target using a <code>M</code> or <code>X</code> packet.  This packet has to be expected
by the target implementation and is handled as any other <code>M</code> or <code>X</code>
packet.

   </ul>

   <p>Eventually <span class="sc">gdb</span> replies with another <code>F</code> packet which contains all
necessary information for the target to continue.  This at least contains

     <ul>
<li>Return value.

     <li><code>errno</code>, if has been changed by the system call.

     <li>&ldquo;Ctrl-C&rdquo; flag.

   </ul>

   <p>After having done the needed type and value coercion, the target continues
the latest continue or step action.

<p><a name="index-ctrl_002dc-message_002c-in-file_002di_002fo-protocol-3517"></a>
If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-C</span></samp>&rsquo; flag is set in the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
reply packet (see <a href="#The-F-Reply-Packet">The F Reply Packet</a>),
the target should behave as if it had
gotten a break message.  The meaning for the target is &ldquo;system call
interrupted by <code>SIGINT</code>&rdquo;.  Consequentially, the target should actually stop
(as with a break message) and return to <span class="sc">gdb</span> with a <code>T02</code>
packet.

   <p>It's important for the target to know in which
state the system call was interrupted.  There are two possible cases:

     <ul>
<li>The system call hasn't been performed on the host yet.

     <li>The system call on the host has been finished.

   </ul>

   <p>These two states can be distinguished by the target by the value of the
returned <code>errno</code>.  If it's the protocol representation of <code>EINTR</code>, the system
call hasn't been performed.  This is equivalent to the <code>EINTR</code> handling
on POSIX systems.  In any other case, the target may presume that the
system call has been finished &mdash; successfully or not &mdash; and should behave
as if the break message arrived right after the system call.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> must behave reliably.  If the system call has not been called
yet, <span class="sc">gdb</span> may send the <code>F</code> reply immediately, setting <code>EINTR</code> as
<code>errno</code> in the packet.  If the system call on the host has been finished
before the user requests a break, the full action must be finished by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  This requires sending <code>M</code> or <code>X</code> packets as necessary. 
The <code>F</code> packet may only be sent when either nothing has happened
or the full action has been completed.

<p><a name="index-console-i_002fo-as-part-of-file_002di_002fo-3518"></a>
By default and if not explicitly closed by the target system, the file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the <span class="sc">gdb</span> console.  Output
on the <span class="sc">gdb</span> console is handled as any other file output operation
(<code>write(1, ...)</code> or <code>write(2, ...)</code>).  Console input is handled
by <span class="sc">gdb</span> so that after the target read request from file descriptor
0 all following typing is buffered until either one of the following
conditions is met:

     <ul>
<li>The user types <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>.  The behaviour is as explained above, and the
<code>read</code>
system call is treated as finished.

     <li>The user presses &lt;RET&gt;.  This is treated as end of input with a trailing
newline.

     <li>The user types <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>.  This is treated as end of input.  No trailing
character (neither newline nor &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ctrl-D</span></samp>&rsquo;) is appended to the input.

   </ul>

   <p>If the user has typed more characters than fit in the buffer given to
the <code>read</code> call, the trailing characters are buffered in <span class="sc">gdb</span> until
either another <code>read(0, ...)</code> is requested by the target, or debugging
is stopped at the user's request.

<p><a name="index-integral-datatypes_002c-in-file_002di_002fo-protocol-3535"></a>
The integral datatypes used in the system calls are <code>int</code>,
<code>unsigned int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>unsigned long</code>,
<code>mode_t</code>, and <code>time_t</code>.

   <p><code>int</code>, <code>unsigned int</code>, <code>mode_t</code> and <code>time_t</code> are
implemented as 32 bit values in this protocol.

   <p><code>long</code> and <code>unsigned long</code> are implemented as 64 bit types.

   <p>See <a href="#Limits">Limits</a>, for corresponding MIN and MAX values (similar to those
in <samp><span class="file">limits.h</span></samp>) to allow range checking on host and target.

   <p><code>time_t</code> datatypes are defined as seconds since the Epoch.

   <p>All integral datatypes transferred as part of a memory read or write of a
structured datatype e.g. a <code>struct stat</code> have to be given in big endian
byte order.

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Pointer Values</h5>

<p><a name="index-pointer-values_002c-in-file_002di_002fo-protocol-3536"></a>
Pointers to target data are transmitted as they are.  An exception
is made for pointers to buffers for which the length isn't
transmitted as part of the function call, namely strings.  Strings
are transmitted as a pointer/length pair, both as hex values, e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>1aaf/12</code>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which is a pointer to data of length 18 bytes at position 0x1aaf. 
The length is defined as the full string length in bytes, including
the trailing null byte.  For example, the string <code>"hello world"</code>
at address 0x123456 is transmitted as

<pre class="smallexample">     <code>123456/d</code>

Structured data which is transferred using a memory read or write (for
example, a <code>struct stat</code>) is expected to be in a protocol-specific format
with all scalar multibyte datatypes being big endian.  Translation to
this representation needs to be done both by the target before the <code>F</code>
packet is sent, and by <span class="sc">gdb</span> before
it transfers memory to the target.  Transferred pointers to structured
data should point to the already-coerced data at any time.

</pre>
   <p>The integral datatypes conform to the definitions given in the
appropriate section (see <a href="#Integral-Datatypes">Integral Datatypes</a>, for details) so this
structure is of size 64 bytes.

   <p>The values of several fields have a restricted meaning and/or
range of values.

     <dl>
<dt><code>st_dev</code><dd>A value of 0 represents a file, 1 the console.

     <br><dt><code>st_ino</code><dd>No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

     <br><dt><code>st_mode</code><dd>Valid mode bits are described in <a href="#Constants">Constants</a>.  Any other
bits have currently no meaning for the target.

     <br><dt><code>st_uid</code><dt><code>st_gid</code><dt><code>st_rdev</code><dd>No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

     <br><dt><code>st_atime</code><dt><code>st_mtime</code><dt><code>st_ctime</code><dd>These values have a host and file system dependent
accuracy.  Especially on Windows hosts, the file system may not
support exact timing values. 
</dl>

   <p>The target gets a <code>struct stat</code> of the above representation and is
responsible for coercing it to the target representation before
continuing.

   <p>Note that due to size differences between the host, target, and protocol
representations of <code>struct stat</code> members, these members could eventually
get truncated on the target.

<h3 class="section">E.14 Library List Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-library-list-format_002c-remote-protocol-3547"></a>
On some platforms, a dynamic loader (e.g. <samp><span class="file">ld.so</span></samp>) runs in the
same process as your application to manage libraries.  In this case,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can use the loader's symbol table and normal memory
operations to maintain a list of shared libraries.  On other
platforms, the operating system manages loaded libraries. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can not retrieve the list of currently loaded libraries
through memory operations, so it uses the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:libraries:read</span></samp>&rsquo;
packet (see <a href="#qXfer-library-list-read">qXfer library list read</a>) instead.  The remote stub
queries the target's operating system and reports which libraries
are loaded.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:libraries:read</span></samp>&rsquo; packet returns an XML document which
lists loaded libraries and their offsets.  Each library has an
associated name and one or more segment or section base addresses,
which report where the library was loaded in memory.

   <p>For the common case of libraries that are fully linked binaries, the
library should have a list of segments.  If the target supports
dynamic linking of a relocatable object file, its library XML element
should instead include a list of allocated sections.  The segment or
section bases are start addresses, not relocation offsets; they do not
depend on the library's link-time base addresses.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
library lists.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

   <p>A simple memory map, with one loaded library relocated by a single
offset, looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;library-list&gt;
       &lt;library name="/lib/libc.so.6"&gt;
         &lt;segment address="0x10000000"/&gt;
       &lt;/library&gt;
     &lt;/library-list&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Another simple memory map, with one loaded library with three
allocated sections (.text, .data, .bss), looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;library-list&gt;
       &lt;library name="sharedlib.o"&gt;
         &lt;section address="0x10000000"/&gt;
         &lt;section address="0x20000000"/&gt;
         &lt;section address="0x30000000"/&gt;
       &lt;/library&gt;
     &lt;/library-list&gt;
</pre>
   <p>The format of a library list is described by this DTD:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;!-- library-list: Root element with versioning --&gt;
     &lt;!ELEMENT library-list  (library)*&gt;
     &lt;!ATTLIST library-list  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0"&gt;
     &lt;!ELEMENT library       (segment*, section*)&gt;
     &lt;!ATTLIST library       name    CDATA   #REQUIRED&gt;
     &lt;!ELEMENT segment       EMPTY&gt;
     &lt;!ATTLIST segment       address CDATA   #REQUIRED&gt;
     &lt;!ELEMENT section       EMPTY&gt;
     &lt;!ATTLIST section       address CDATA   #REQUIRED&gt;
</pre>
   <p>In addition, segments and section descriptors cannot be mixed within a
single library element, and you must supply at least one segment or
section for each library.

<h3 class="section">E.15 Library List Format for SVR4 Targets</h3>

<p><a name="index-library-list-format_002c-remote-protocol-3548"></a>
On SVR4 platforms <span class="sc">gdb</span> can use the symbol table of a dynamic loader
(e.g. <samp><span class="file">ld.so</span></samp>) and normal memory operations to maintain a list of
shared libraries.  Still a special library list provided by this packet is
more efficient for the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote protocol.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:libraries-svr4:read</span></samp>&rsquo; packet returns an XML document which lists
loaded libraries and their SVR4 linker parameters.  For each library on SVR4
target, the following parameters are reported:

     <ul>
<li><code>name</code>, the absolute file name from the <code>l_name</code> field of
<code>struct link_map</code>. 
<li><code>lm</code> with address of <code>struct link_map</code> used for TLS
(Thread Local Storage) access. 
<li><code>l_addr</code>, the displacement as read from the field <code>l_addr</code> of
<code>struct link_map</code>.  For prelinked libraries this is not an absolute
memory address.  It is a displacement of absolute memory address against
address the file was prelinked to during the library load. 
<li><code>l_ld</code>, which is memory address of the <code>PT_DYNAMIC</code> segment
</ul>

   <p>Additionally the single <code>main-lm</code> attribute specifies address of
<code>struct link_map</code> used for the main executable.  This parameter is used
for TLS access and its presence is optional.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
SVR4 library lists.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

   <p>A simple memory map, with two loaded libraries (which do not use prelink),
looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;library-list-svr4 version="1.0" main-lm="0xe4f8f8"&gt;
       &lt;library name="/lib/ld-linux.so.2" lm="0xe4f51c" l_addr="0xe2d000"

<h3 class="section">E.16 Memory Map Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-memory-map-format-3549"></a>
To be able to write into flash memory, <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to obtain a
memory map from the target.  This section describes the format of the
memory map.

   <p>The memory map is obtained using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer:memory-map:read</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="#qXfer-memory-map-read">qXfer memory map read</a>) packet and is an XML document that
lists memory regions.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
memory maps.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

   <p>The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
     &lt;!DOCTYPE memory-map
               PUBLIC "+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN"
                      "http://sourceware.org/gdb/gdb-memory-map.dtd"&gt;
     &lt;memory-map&gt;
         region...
     &lt;/memory-map&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Each region can be either:

     <ul>
<li>A region of RAM starting at <var>addr</var> and extending for <var>length</var>
bytes from there:

     <pre class="smallexample">          &lt;memory type="ram" start="<var>addr</var>" length="<var>length</var>"/&gt;
</pre>
     <li>A region of read-only memory:

     <pre class="smallexample">          &lt;memory type="rom" start="<var>addr</var>" length="<var>length</var>"/&gt;
</pre>
     <li>A region of flash memory, with erasure blocks <var>blocksize</var>
bytes in length:

     <pre class="smallexample">          &lt;memory type="flash" start="<var>addr</var>" length="<var>length</var>"&gt;
            &lt;property name="blocksize"&gt;<var>blocksize</var>&lt;/property&gt;
          &lt;/memory&gt;
</pre>
     </ul>

   <p>Regions must not overlap.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> assumes that areas of memory not covered
by the memory map are RAM, and uses the ordinary &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo;
packets to write to addresses in such ranges.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix F The GDB Agent Expression Mechanism</h2>

<p>In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   <p>Using GDB's <code>trace</code> and <code>collect</code> commands, the user can
specify locations in the program, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate
when those locations are reached.  Later, using the <code>tfind</code>
command, she can examine the values those expressions had when the
program hit the trace points.  The expressions may also denote objects
in memory &mdash; structures or arrays, for example &mdash; whose values GDB
should record; while visiting a particular tracepoint, the user may
inspect those objects as if they were in memory at that moment. 
However, because GDB records these values without interacting with the
user, it can do so quickly and unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing
the program's behavior.

   <p>When GDB is debugging a remote target, the GDB <dfn>agent</dfn> code running
on the target computes the values of the expressions itself.  To avoid
having a full symbolic expression evaluator on the agent, GDB translates
expressions in the source language into a simpler bytecode language, and
then sends the bytecode to the agent; the agent then executes the
bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.

   <p>The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the bulk
of which are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition, subtraction,
shifts, and so on) and various sizes of literals and memory reference
operations.  The bytecode interpreter operates strictly on machine-level
values &mdash; various sizes of integers and floating point numbers &mdash; and
requires no information about types or symbols; thus, the interpreter's
internal data structures are simple, and each bytecode requires only a
few native machine instructions to implement it.  The interpreter is
small, and strict limits on the memory and time required to evaluate an
expression are easy to determine, making it suitable for use by the
debugging agent in real-time applications.

<h3 class="section">F.1 General Bytecode Design</h3>

<p>The agent represents bytecode expressions as an array of bytes.  Each
instruction is one byte long (thus the term <dfn>bytecode</dfn>).  Some
instructions are followed by operand bytes; for example, the <code>goto</code>
instruction is followed by a destination for the jump.

   <p>The bytecode interpreter is a stack-based machine; most instructions pop
their operands off the stack, perform some operation, and push the
result back on the stack for the next instruction to consume.  Each
element of the stack may contain either a integer or a floating point
value; these values are as many bits wide as the largest integer that
can be directly manipulated in the source language.  Stack elements
carry no record of their type; bytecode could push a value as an
integer, then pop it as a floating point value.  However, GDB will not
generate code which does this.  In C, one might define the type of a
stack element as follows:
<pre class="example">     union agent_val {
       LONGEST l;
       DOUBLEST d;
     };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>LONGEST</code> and <code>DOUBLEST</code> are <code>typedef</code> names for
the largest integer and floating point types on the machine.

   <p>By the time the bytecode interpreter reaches the end of the expression,
the value of the expression should be the only value left on the stack. 
For tracing applications, <code>trace</code> bytecodes in the expression will
have recorded the necessary data, and the value on the stack may be
discarded.  For other applications, like conditional breakpoints, the
value may be useful.

   <p>Separate from the stack, the interpreter has two registers:
     <dl>
<dt><code>pc</code><dd>The address of the next bytecode to execute.

     <br><dt><code>start</code><dd>The address of the start of the bytecode expression, necessary for
interpreting the <code>goto</code> and <code>if_goto</code> instructions.

   </dl>
   Neither of these registers is directly visible to the bytecode language
itself, but they are useful for defining the meanings of the bytecode
operations.

   <p>There are no instructions to perform side effects on the running
program, or call the program's functions; we assume that these
expressions are only used for unobtrusive debugging, not for patching
the running code.

   <p>Most bytecode instructions do not distinguish between the various sizes
of values, and operate on full-width values; the upper bits of the
values are simply ignored, since they do not usually make a difference
to the value computed.  The exceptions to this rule are:
     <dl>
<dt>memory reference instructions (<code>ref</code><var>n</var>)<dd>There are distinct instructions to fetch different word sizes from
memory.  Once on the stack, however, the values are treated as full-size
integers.  They may need to be sign-extended; the <code>ext</code> instruction
exists for this purpose.

     <br><dt>the sign-extension instruction (<code>ext</code> <var>n</var>)<dd>These clearly need to know which portion of their operand is to be
extended to occupy the full length of the word.

   </dl>

   <p>If the interpreter is unable to evaluate an expression completely for
some reason (a memory location is inaccessible, or a divisor is zero,
for example), we say that interpretation &ldquo;terminates with an error&rdquo;. 
This means that the problem is reported back to the interpreter's caller
in some helpful way.  In general, code using agent expressions should
assume that they may attempt to divide by zero, fetch arbitrary memory
locations, and misbehave in other ways.

   <p>Even complicated C expressions compile to a few bytecode instructions;
for example, the expression <code>x + y * z</code> would typically produce
code like the following, assuming that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> live in
registers, and <code>z</code> is a global variable holding a 32-bit
<code>int</code>:
<pre class="example">     reg 1
     reg 2
     const32 <i>address of z</i>
     ref32
     ext 32
     mul
     add
     end
</pre>
   <p>In detail, these mean:
     <dl>
<dt><code>reg 1</code><dd>Push the value of register 1 (presumably holding <code>x</code>) onto the
stack.

     <br><dt><code>reg 2</code><dd>Push the value of register 2 (holding <code>y</code>).

     <br><dt><code>const32 </code><i>address of z</i><dd>Push the address of <code>z</code> onto the stack.

     <br><dt><code>ref32</code><dd>Fetch a 32-bit word from the address at the top of the stack; replace
the address on the stack with the value.  Thus, we replace the address
of <code>z</code> with <code>z</code>'s value.

     <br><dt><code>ext 32</code><dd>Sign-extend the value on the top of the stack from 32 bits to full
length.  This is necessary because <code>z</code> is a signed integer.

     <br><dt><code>mul</code><dd>Pop the top two numbers on the stack, multiply them, and push their
product.  Now the top of the stack contains the value of the expression
<code>y * z</code>.

     <br><dt><code>add</code><dd>Pop the top two numbers, add them, and push the sum.  Now the top of the
stack contains the value of <code>x + y * z</code>.

     <br><dt><code>end</code><dd>Stop executing; the value left on the stack top is the value to be
recorded.

   </dl>

<h3 class="section">F.2 Bytecode Descriptions</h3>

<p>Each bytecode description has the following form:

     <dl>
<dt><code>add</code> (0x02): <var>a</var> <var>b</var> &rArr; <var>a+b</var><dd>
Pop the top two stack items, <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, as integers; push
their sum, as an integer.

   </dl>

   <p>In this example, <code>add</code> is the name of the bytecode, and
<code>(0x02)</code> is the one-byte value used to encode the bytecode, in
hexadecimal.  The phrase &ldquo;<var>a</var> <var>b</var> &rArr; <var>a+b</var>&rdquo; shows
the stack before and after the bytecode executes.  Beforehand, the stack
must contain at least two values, <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>; since the top of
the stack is to the right, <var>b</var> is on the top of the stack, and
<var>a</var> is underneath it.  After execution, the bytecode will have
popped <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> from the stack, and replaced them with a
single value, <var>a+b</var>.  There may be other values on the stack below
those shown, but the bytecode affects only those shown.

   <p>Here is another example:

     <dl>
<dt><code>const8</code> (0x22) <var>n</var>: &rArr; <var>n</var><dd>Push the 8-bit integer constant <var>n</var> on the stack, without sign
extension.

   </dl>

   <p>In this example, the bytecode <code>const8</code> takes an operand <var>n</var>
directly from the bytecode stream; the operand follows the <code>const8</code>
bytecode itself.  We write any such operands immediately after the name
of the bytecode, before the colon, and describe the exact encoding of
the operand in the bytecode stream in the body of the bytecode
description.

   <p>For the <code>const8</code> bytecode, there are no stack items given before
the &rArr;; this simply means that the bytecode consumes no values
from the stack.  If a bytecode consumes no values, or produces no
values, the list on either side of the &rArr; may be empty.

   <p>If a value is written as <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, or <var>n</var>, then the bytecode
treats it as an integer.  If a value is written is <var>addr</var>, then the
bytecode treats it as an address.

   <p>We do not fully describe the floating point operations here; although
this design can be extended in a clean way to handle floating point
values, they are not of immediate interest to the customer, so we avoid
describing them, to save time.

     <dl>
<dt><code>float</code> (0x01): &rArr;<dd>
Prefix for floating-point bytecodes.  Not implemented yet.

     <br><dt><code>add</code> (0x02): <var>a</var> <var>b</var> &rArr; <var>a+b</var><dd>Pop two integers from the stack, and push their sum, as an integer.

     <br><dt><code>mul</code> (0x04): <var>a</var> <var>b</var> &rArr; <var>a*b</var><dd>Pop two integers from the stack, multiply them, and push the product on
the stack.  Note that, when one multiplies two <var>n</var>-bit numbers
yielding another <var>n</var>-bit number, it is irrelevant whether the

twos-complement value, extend it to full length.  This means that all

0) are set to the value of bit <var>n-1</var>.  Note that <var>n</var> may be
larger than or equal to the width of the stack elements of the bytecode

For bytecode
<code>ref</code><var>n</var>, fetch an <var>n</var>-bit value from <var>addr</var>, using the
natural target endianness.  Push the fetched value as an unsigned
integer.

     <p>Note that <var>addr</var> may not be aligned in any particular way; the

<var>n</var>, a single byte, indicates the stack item to copy.  If <var>n</var>
is zero, this is the same as <code>dup</code>; if <var>n</var> is one, it copies
the item under the top item, etc.  If <var>n</var> exceeds the number of
items on the stack, terminate with an error.

     <br><dt><code>rot</code> (0x33): <var>a</var> <var>b</var> <var>c</var> =&gt; <var>c</var> <var>b</var> <var>a</var><dd>Rotate the top three items on the stack.

     <br><dt><code>if_goto</code> (0x20) <var>offset</var>: <var>a</var> &rArr;<dd>Pop an integer off the stack; if it is non-zero, branch to the given
offset in the bytecode string.  Otherwise, continue to the next
instruction in the bytecode stream.  In other words, if <var>a</var> is
non-zero, set the <code>pc</code> register to <code>start</code> + <var>offset</var>. 
Thus, an offset of zero denotes the beginning of the expression.

     <p>The <var>offset</var> is stored as a sixteen-bit unsigned value, stored
immediately following the <code>if_goto</code> bytecode.  It is always stored
most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
endianness.  The offset is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where fetching a
16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you should fetch the
offset one byte at a time.

     <br><dt><code>goto</code> (0x21) <var>offset</var>: &rArr;<dd>Branch unconditionally to <var>offset</var>; in other words, set the
<code>pc</code> register to <code>start</code> + <var>offset</var>.

     <p>The offset is stored in the same way as for the <code>if_goto</code> bytecode.

To produce a small negative value, push a small twos-complement value,
and then sign-extend it using the <code>ext</code> bytecode.

     <p>The constant <var>n</var> is stored in the appropriate number of bytes
following the <code>const</code><var>b</var> bytecode.  The constant <var>n</var> is
always stored most significant byte first, regardless of the target's
normal endianness.  The constant is not guaranteed to fall at any
particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where
fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you
should fetch <var>n</var> one byte at a time.

     <br><dt><code>reg</code> (0x26) <var>n</var>: &rArr; <var>a</var><dd>Push the value of register number <var>n</var>, without sign extension.  The
registers are numbered following GDB's conventions.

     <p>The register number <var>n</var> is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
immediately following the <code>reg</code> bytecode.  It is always stored most
significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal endianness. 
The register number is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where fetching a
16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you should fetch the
register number one byte at a time.

     <br><dt><code>getv</code> (0x2c) <var>n</var>: &rArr; <var>v</var><dd>Push the value of trace state variable number <var>n</var>, without sign

     <p>The variable number <var>n</var> is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
immediately following the <code>getv</code> bytecode.  It is always stored most
significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal endianness. 
The variable number is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where fetching a
16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you should fetch the
register number one byte at a time.

     <br><dt><code>setv</code> (0x2d) <var>n</var>: <var>v</var> &rArr; <var>v</var><dd>Set trace state variable number <var>n</var> to the value found on the top
of the stack.  The stack is unchanged, so that the value is readily
available if the assignment is part of a larger expression.  The
handling of <var>n</var> is as described for <code>getv</code>.

     <br><dt><code>trace</code> (0x0c): <var>addr</var> <var>size</var> &rArr;<dd>Record the contents of the <var>size</var> bytes at <var>addr</var> in a trace

buffer, for later retrieval by GDB.  <var>size</var> is a single byte
unsigned integer following the <code>trace</code> opcode.

     <p>This bytecode is equivalent to the sequence <code>dup const8 </code><var>size</var><code>
trace</code>, but we provide it anyway to save space in bytecode strings.

     <br><dt><code>trace16</code> (0x30) <var>size</var>: <var>addr</var> &rArr; <var>addr</var><dd>Identical to trace_quick, except that <var>size</var> is a 16-bit big-endian
unsigned integer, not a single byte.  This should probably have been
named <code>trace_quick16</code>, for consistency.

     <br><dt><code>tracev</code> (0x2e) <var>n</var>: &rArr; <var>a</var><dd>Record the value of trace state variable number <var>n</var> in the trace

     <br><dt><code>printf</code> (0x34)  <var>numargs</var> <var>string</var> &rArr;<dd>Do a formatted print, in the style of the C function <code>printf</code>). 
The value of <var>numargs</var> is the number of arguments to expect on the
stack, while <var>string</var> is the format string, prefixed with a
two-byte length.  The last byte of the string must be zero, and is
included in the length.  The format string includes escaped sequences
just as it appears in C source, so for instance the format string
<code>"\t%d\n"</code> is six characters long, and the output will consist of
a tab character, a decimal number, and a newline.  At the top of the
stack, above the values to be printed, this bytecode will pop a
&ldquo;function&rdquo; and &ldquo;channel&rdquo;.  If the function is nonzero, then the
target may treat it as a function and call it, passing the channel as
a first argument, as with the C function <code>fprintf</code>.  If the
function is zero, then the target may simply call a standard formatted
print function of its choice.  In all, this bytecode pops 2 +
<var>numargs</var> stack elements, and pushes nothing.

     <br><dt><code>end</code> (0x27): &rArr;<dd>Stop executing bytecode; the result should be the top element of the
stack.  If the purpose of the expression was to compute an lvalue or a
range of memory, then the next-to-top of the stack is the lvalue's
address, and the top of the stack is the lvalue's size, in bytes.

<h3 class="section">F.3 Using Agent Expressions</h3>

<p>Agent expressions can be used in several different ways by <span class="sc">gdb</span>,
and the debugger can generate different bytecode sequences as appropriate.

   <p>One possibility is to do expression evaluation on the target rather
than the host, such as for the conditional of a conditional
tracepoint.  In such a case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> compiles the source
expression into a bytecode sequence that simply gets values from
registers or memory, does arithmetic, and returns a result.

   <p>Another way to use agent expressions is for tracepoint data
collection.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> generates a different bytecode sequence for
collection; in addition to bytecodes that do the calculation,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> adds <code>trace</code> bytecodes to save the pieces of
memory that were used.

     <ul>
<li>The user selects trace points in the program's code at which GDB should
collect data.

     <li>The user specifies expressions to evaluate at each trace point.  These
expressions may denote objects in memory, in which case those objects'
contents are recorded as the program runs, or computed values, in which
case the values themselves are recorded.

     <li>GDB transmits the tracepoints and their associated expressions to the
GDB agent, running on the debugging target.

     <li>The agent arranges to be notified when a trace point is hit.

     <li>When execution on the target reaches a trace point, the agent evaluates
the expressions associated with that trace point, and records the
resulting values and memory ranges.

     <li>Later, when the user selects a given trace event and inspects the
objects and expression values recorded, GDB talks to the agent to
retrieve recorded data as necessary to meet the user's requests.  If the
user asks to see an object whose contents have not been recorded, GDB
reports an error.

<h3 class="section">F.4 Varying Target Capabilities</h3>

<p>Some targets don't support floating-point, and some would rather not
have to deal with <code>long long</code> operations.  Also, different targets
will have different stack sizes, and different bytecode buffer lengths.

   <p>Thus, GDB needs a way to ask the target about itself.  We haven't worked
out the details yet, but in general, GDB should be able to send the
target a packet asking it to describe itself.  The reply should be a
packet whose length is explicit, so we can add new information to the
packet in future revisions of the agent, without confusing old versions
of GDB, and it should contain a version number.  It should contain at
least the following information:

     <ul>
<li>whether floating point is supported

     <li>whether <code>long long</code> is supported

     <li>maximum acceptable size of bytecode stack

<h3 class="section">F.5 Rationale</h3>

<p>Some of the design decisions apparent above are arguable.

     <dl>
<dt><b>What about stack overflow/underflow?</b><dd>GDB should be able to query the target to discover its stack size. 
Given that information, GDB can determine at translation time whether a
given expression will overflow the stack.  But this spec isn't about
what kinds of error-checking GDB ought to do.

     <br><dt><b>Why are you doing everything in LONGEST?</b><dd>
Speed isn't important, but agent code size is; using LONGEST brings in a
bunch of support code to do things like division, etc.  So this is a
serious concern.

     <p>First, note that you don't need different bytecodes for different
operand sizes.  You can generate code without <em>knowing</em> how big the
stack elements actually are on the target.  If the target only supports
32-bit ints, and you don't send any 64-bit bytecodes, everything just
works.  The observation here is that the MIPS and the Alpha have only
fixed-size registers, and you can still get C's semantics even though
most instructions only operate on full-sized words.  You just need to
make sure everything is properly sign-extended at the right times.  So
there is no need for 32- and 64-bit variants of the bytecodes.  Just
implement everything using the largest size you support.

     <p>GDB should certainly check to see what sizes the target supports, so the
user can get an error earlier, rather than later.  But this information
is not necessary for correctness.

     <br><dt><b>Why don't you have </b><code>&gt;</code><b> or </b><code>&lt;=</code><b> operators?</b><dd>I want to keep the interpreter small, and we don't need them.  We can
combine the <code>less_</code> opcodes with <code>log_not</code>, and swap the order
of the operands, yielding all four asymmetrical comparison operators. 
For example, <code>(x &lt;= y)</code> is <code>! (x &gt; y)</code>, which is <code>! (y &lt;
x)</code>.

     <br><dt><b>Why do you have </b><code>log_not</code><b>?</b><dt><b>Why do you have </b><code>ext</code><b>?</b><dt><b>Why do you have </b><code>zero_ext</code><b>?</b><dd>These are all easily synthesized from other instructions, but I expect
them to be used frequently, and they're simple, so I include them to
keep bytecode strings short.

     <p><code>log_not</code> is equivalent to <code>const8 0 equal</code>; it's used in half
the relational operators.

     <p><code>ext </code><var>n</var> is equivalent to <code>const8 </code><var>s-n</var><code> lsh const8
</code><var>s-n</var><code> rsh_signed</code>, where <var>s</var> is the size of the stack elements;
it follows <code>ref</code><var>m</var> and <var>reg</var> bytecodes when the value
should be signed.  See the next bulleted item.

     <p><code>zero_ext </code><var>n</var> is equivalent to <code>const</code><var>m</var> <var>mask</var><code>
log_and</code>; it's used whenever we push the value of a register, because we
can't assume the upper bits of the register aren't garbage.

     <br><dt><b>Why not have sign-extending variants of the </b><code>ref</code><b> operators?</b><dd>Because that would double the number of <code>ref</code> operators, and we
need the <code>ext</code> bytecode anyway for accessing bitfields.

     <br><dt><b>Why not have constant-address variants of the </b><code>ref</code><b> operators?</b><dd>Because that would double the number of <code>ref</code> operators again, and
<code>const32 </code><var>address</var><code> ref32</code> is only one byte longer.

     <br><dt><b>Why do the </b><code>ref</code><var>n</var><b> operators have to support unaligned fetches?</b><dd>GDB will generate bytecode that fetches multi-byte values at unaligned
addresses whenever the executable's debugging information tells it to. 
Furthermore, GDB does not know the value the pointer will have when GDB
generates the bytecode, so it cannot determine whether a particular
fetch will be aligned or not.

     <p>In particular, structure bitfields may be several bytes long, but follow
no alignment rules; members of packed structures are not necessarily
aligned either.

     <p>In general, there are many cases where unaligned references occur in
correct C code, either at the programmer's explicit request, or at the
compiler's discretion.  Thus, it is simpler to make the GDB agent
bytecodes work correctly in all circumstances than to make GDB guess in
each case whether the compiler did the usual thing.

     <br><dt><b>Why are there no side-effecting operators?</b><dd>Because our current client doesn't want them?  That's a cheap answer.  I
think the real answer is that I'm afraid of implementing function
calls.  We should re-visit this issue after the present contract is
delivered.

     <br><dt><b>Why aren't the </b><code>goto</code><b> ops PC-relative?</b><dd>The interpreter has the base address around anyway for PC bounds
checking, and it seemed simpler.

     <br><dt><b>Why is there only one offset size for the </b><code>goto</code><b> ops?</b><dd>Offsets are currently sixteen bits.  I'm not happy with this situation
either:

     <p>Suppose we have multiple branch ops with different offset sizes.  As I
generate code left-to-right, all my jumps are forward jumps (there are
no loops in expressions), so I never know the target when I emit the
jump opcode.  Thus, I have to either always assume the largest offset
size, or do jump relaxation on the code after I generate it, which seems
like a big waste of time.

     <p>I can imagine a reasonable expression being longer than 256 bytes.  I
can't imagine one being longer than 64k.  Thus, we need 16-bit offsets. 
This kind of reasoning is so bogus, but relaxation is pathetic.

     <p>The other approach would be to generate code right-to-left.  Then I'd
always know my offset size.  That might be fun.

     <br><dt><b>Where is the function call bytecode?</b><dd>
When we add side-effects, we should add this.

     <br><dt><b>Why does the </b><code>reg</code><b> bytecode take a 16-bit register number?</b><dd>
Intel's IA-64 architecture has 128 general-purpose registers,
and 128 floating-point registers, and I'm sure it has some random
control registers.

     <br><dt><b>Why do we need </b><code>trace</code><b> and </b><code>trace_quick</code><b>?</b><dd>Because GDB needs to record all the memory contents and registers an
expression touches.  If the user wants to evaluate an expression
<code>x-&gt;y-&gt;z</code>, the agent must record the values of <code>x</code> and
<code>x-&gt;y</code> as well as the value of <code>x-&gt;y-&gt;z</code>.

     <br><dt><b>Don't the </b><code>trace</code><b> bytecodes make the interpreter less general?</b><dd>They do mean that the interpreter contains special-purpose code, but
that doesn't mean the interpreter can only be used for that purpose.  If
an expression doesn't use the <code>trace</code> bytecodes, they don't get in
its way.

     <br><dt><b>Why doesn't </b><code>trace_quick</code><b> consume its arguments the way everything else does?</b><dd>In general, you do want your operators to consume their arguments; it's
consistent, and generally reduces the amount of stack rearrangement
necessary.  However, <code>trace_quick</code> is a kludge to save space; it
only exists so we needn't write <code>dup const8 </code><var>SIZE</var><code> trace</code>
before every memory reference.  Therefore, it's okay for it not to
consume its arguments; it's meant for a specific context in which we
know exactly what it should do with the stack.  If we're going to have a
kludge, it should be an effective kludge.

     <br><dt><b>Why does </b><code>trace16</code><b> exist?</b><dd>That opcode was added by the customer that contracted Cygnus for the
data tracing work.  I personally think it is unnecessary; objects that
large will be quite rare, so it is okay to use <code>dup const16
</code><var>size</var><code> trace</code> in those cases.

     <p>Whatever we decide to do with <code>trace16</code>, we should at least leave
opcode 0x30 reserved, to remain compatible with the customer who added
it.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix G Target Descriptions</h2>

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions-3554"></a>
One of the challenges of using <span class="sc">gdb</span> to debug embedded systems
is that there are so many minor variants of each processor
architecture in use.  It is common practice for vendors to start with
a standard processor core &mdash; ARM, PowerPC, or <acronym>MIPS</acronym>, for example &mdash;
and then make changes to adapt it to a particular market niche.  Some
architectures have hundreds of variants, available from dozens of
vendors.  This leads to a number of problems:

     <ul>
<li>With so many different customized processors, it is difficult for
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintainers to keep up with the changes. 
<li>Since individual variants may have short lifetimes or limited
audiences, it may not be worthwhile to carry information about every
variant in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> source tree. 
<li>When <span class="sc">gdb</span> does support the architecture of the embedded system
at hand, the task of finding the correct architecture name to give the
<samp><span class="command">set architecture</span></samp> command can be error-prone. 
</ul>

   <p>To address these problems, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote protocol allows a
target system to not only identify itself to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but to
actually describe its own features.  This lets <span class="sc">gdb</span> support
processor variants it has never seen before &mdash; to the extent that the
descriptions are accurate, and that <span class="sc">gdb</span> understands them.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
target descriptions.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

<h3 class="section">G.1 Retrieving Descriptions</h3>

<p>Target descriptions can be read from the target automatically, or
specified by the user manually.  The default behavior is to read the
description from the target.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> retrieves it via the remote
protocol using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer</span></samp>&rsquo; requests (see <a href="#General-Query-Packets">qXfer</a>).  The <var>annex</var> in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer</span></samp>&rsquo; packet will be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The contents of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">target.xml</span></samp>&rsquo; annex are an
XML document, of the form described in <a href="#Target-Description-Format">Target Description Format</a>.

   <p>Alternatively, you can specify a file to read for the target description. 
If a file is set, the target will not be queried.  The commands to
specify a file are:

     
<a name="index-set-tdesc-filename-3555"></a>
<dl><dt><code>set tdesc filename </code><var>path</var><dd>Read the target description from <var>path</var>.

     <p><a name="index-unset-tdesc-filename-3556"></a><br><dt><code>unset tdesc filename</code><dd>Do not read the XML target description from a file.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will use the description supplied by the current target.

     <p><a name="index-show-tdesc-filename-3557"></a><br><dt><code>show tdesc filename</code><dd>Show the filename to read for a target description, if any.

<h3 class="section">G.2 Target Description Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-XML-format-3558"></a>
A target description annex is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>
document which complies with the Document Type Definition provided in
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> sources in <samp><span class="file">gdb/features/gdb-target.dtd</span></samp>.  This
means you can use generally available tools like <samp><span class="command">xmllint</span></samp> to
check that your feature descriptions are well-formed and valid. 
However, to help people unfamiliar with XML write descriptions for
their targets, we also describe the grammar here.

   <p>Target descriptions can identify the architecture of the remote target
and (for some architectures) provide information about custom register
sets.  They can also identify the OS ABI of the remote target. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can use this information to autoconfigure for your
target, or to warn you if you connect to an unsupported target.

   <p>Here is a simple target description:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;target version="1.0"&gt;
       &lt;architecture&gt;i386:x86-64&lt;/architecture&gt;
     &lt;/target&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This minimal description only says that the target uses
the x86-64 architecture.

   <p>A target description has the following overall form, with [ ] marking
optional elements and <small class="dots">...</small> marking repeatable elements.  The elements
are explained further below.

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
     &lt;!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "gdb-target.dtd"&gt;
     &lt;target version="1.0"&gt;
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>architecture</var><span class="roman">]</span>
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>osabi</var><span class="roman">]</span>
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>compatible</var><span class="roman">]</span>
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>feature</var>...<span class="roman">]</span>
     &lt;/target&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The description is generally insensitive to whitespace and line
breaks, under the usual common-sense rules.  The XML version
declaration and document type declaration can generally be omitted
(<span class="sc">gdb</span> does not require them), but specifying them may be
useful for XML validation tools.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">version</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;target&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; may also be omitted, but we recommend
including it; if future versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> use an incompatible
revision of <samp><span class="file">gdb-target.dtd</span></samp>, they will detect and report
the version mismatch.

<h4 class="subsection">G.2.1 Inclusion</h4>

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-inclusion-3559"></a><a name="index-XInclude-3560"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cxi_003ainclude_003e-3561"></a>
It can sometimes be valuable to split a target description up into
several different annexes, either for organizational purposes, or to
share files between different possible target descriptions.  You can
divide a description into multiple files by replacing any element of
the target description with an inclusion directive of the form:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;xi:include href="<var>document</var>"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When <span class="sc">gdb</span> encounters an element of this form, it will retrieve
the named XML <var>document</var>, and replace the inclusion directive with
the contents of that document.  If the current description was read
using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer</span></samp>&rsquo;, then so will be the included document;
<var>document</var> will be interpreted as the name of an annex.  If the
current description was read from a file, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for
<var>document</var> as a file in the same directory where it found the
original description.

<h4 class="subsection">G.2.2 Architecture</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_003carchitecture_003e-3562"></a>
An &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;architecture&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element has this form:

<pre class="smallexample">       &lt;architecture&gt;<var>arch</var>&lt;/architecture&gt;
</pre>
   <p><var>arch</var> is one of the architectures from the set accepted by
<code>set architecture</code> (see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">G.2.3 OS ABI</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_003cosabi_003e_007d-3563"></a>
This optional field was introduced in <span class="sc">gdb</span> version 7.0. 
Previous versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> ignore it.

   <p>An &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;osabi&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element has this form:

<pre class="smallexample">       &lt;osabi&gt;<var>abi-name</var>&lt;/osabi&gt;
</pre>
   <p><var>abi-name</var> is an OS ABI name from the same selection accepted by
<code>set&nbsp;osabi</code><!-- /@w --> (see <a href="#ABI">Configuring the Current ABI</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">G.2.4 Compatible Architecture</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_003ccompatible_003e_007d-3564"></a>
This optional field was introduced in <span class="sc">gdb</span> version 7.0. 
Previous versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> ignore it.

   <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;compatible&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element has this form:

<pre class="smallexample">       &lt;compatible&gt;<var>arch</var>&lt;/compatible&gt;
</pre>
   <p><var>arch</var> is one of the architectures from the set accepted by
<code>set architecture</code> (see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).

   <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;compatible&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element is used to specify that the target
is able to run binaries in some other than the main target architecture
given by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;architecture&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element.  For example, on the
Cell Broadband Engine, the main architecture is <code>powerpc:common</code>
or <code>powerpc:common64</code>, but the system is able to run binaries
in the <code>spu</code> architecture as well.  The way to describe this
capability with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;compatible&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">       &lt;architecture&gt;powerpc:common&lt;/architecture&gt;
       &lt;compatible&gt;spu&lt;/compatible&gt;
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">G.2.5 Features</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_003cfeature_003e-3565"></a>
Each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;feature&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; describes some logical portion of the target
system.  Features are currently used to describe available CPU
registers and the types of their contents.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;feature&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element
has this form:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;feature name="<var>name</var>"&gt;
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>type</var>...<span class="roman">]</span>
       <var>reg</var>...
     &lt;/feature&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each feature's name should be unique within the description.  The name
of a feature does not matter unless <span class="sc">gdb</span> has some special
knowledge of the contents of that feature; if it does, the feature
should have its standard name.  See <a href="#Standard-Target-Features">Standard Target Features</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">G.2.6 Types</h4>

<p>Any register's value is a collection of bits which <span class="sc">gdb</span> must
interpret.  The default interpretation is a two's complement integer,
but other types can be requested by name in the register description. 
Some predefined types are provided by <span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="#Predefined-Target-Types">Predefined Target Types</a>), and the description can define additional composite types.

   <p>Each type element must have an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">id</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute, which gives
a unique (within the containing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;feature&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;) name to the type. 
Types must be defined before they are used.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_003cvector_003e-3566"></a>Some targets offer vector registers, which can be treated as arrays
of scalar elements.  These types are written as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;vector&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; elements,
specifying the array element type, <var>type</var>, and the number of elements,
<var>count</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;vector id="<var>id</var>" type="<var>type</var>" count="<var>count</var>"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_003cunion_003e-3567"></a>If a register's value is usefully viewed in multiple ways, define it
with a union type containing the useful representations.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;union&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element contains one or more &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;field&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; elements,
each of which has a <var>name</var> and a <var>type</var>:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;union id="<var>id</var>"&gt;
       &lt;field name="<var>name</var>" type="<var>type</var>"/&gt;
       ...
     &lt;/union&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_003cstruct_003e-3568"></a>If a register's value is composed from several separate values, define
it with a structure type.  There are two forms of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;struct&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
element; a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;struct&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element must either contain only bitfields
or contain no bitfields.  If the structure contains only bitfields,
its total size in bytes must be specified, each bitfield must have an
explicit start and end, and bitfields are automatically assigned an
integer type.  The field's <var>start</var> should be less than or
equal to its <var>end</var>, and zero represents the least significant bit.

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;struct id="<var>id</var>" size="<var>size</var>"&gt;
       &lt;field name="<var>name</var>" start="<var>start</var>" end="<var>end</var>"/&gt;
       ...
     &lt;/struct&gt;
</pre>
   <p>If the structure contains no bitfields, then each field has an
explicit type, and no implicit padding is added.

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;struct id="<var>id</var>"&gt;
       &lt;field name="<var>name</var>" type="<var>type</var>"/&gt;
       ...
     &lt;/struct&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_003cflags_003e-3569"></a>If a register's value is a series of single-bit flags, define it with
a flags type.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;flags&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; element has an explicit <var>size</var>
and contains one or more &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;field&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; elements.  Each field has a
<var>name</var>, a <var>start</var>, and an <var>end</var>.  Only single-bit flags
are supported.

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;flags id="<var>id</var>" size="<var>size</var>"&gt;
       &lt;field name="<var>name</var>" start="<var>start</var>" end="<var>end</var>"/&gt;
       ...
     &lt;/flags&gt;
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">G.2.7 Registers</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_003creg_003e-3570"></a>
Each register is represented as an element with this form:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;reg name="<var>name</var>"
          bitsize="<var>size</var>"
          <span class="roman">[</span>regnum="<var>num</var>"<span class="roman">]</span>
          <span class="roman">[</span>save-restore="<var>save-restore</var>"<span class="roman">]</span>
          <span class="roman">[</span>type="<var>type</var>"<span class="roman">]</span>
          <span class="roman">[</span>group="<var>group</var>"<span class="roman">]</span>/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The components are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><var>name</var><dd>The register's name; it must be unique within the target description.

     <br><dt><var>bitsize</var><dd>The register's size, in bits.

     <br><dt><var>regnum</var><dd>The register's number.  If omitted, a register's number is one greater
than that of the previous register (either in the current feature or in
a preceding feature); the first register in the target description
defaults to zero.  This register number is used to read or write
the register; e.g. it is used in the remote <code>p</code> and <code>P</code>
packets, and registers appear in the <code>g</code> and <code>G</code> packets
in order of increasing register number.

     <br><dt><var>save-restore</var><dd>Whether the register should be preserved across inferior function
calls; this must be either <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.  The default is
<code>yes</code>, which is appropriate for most registers except for
some system control registers; this is not related to the target's
ABI.

     <br><dt><var>type</var><dd>The type of the register.  It may be a predefined type, a type
defined in the current feature, or one of the special types <code>int</code>
and <code>float</code>.  <code>int</code> is an integer type of the correct size
for <var>bitsize</var>, and <code>float</code> is a floating point type (in the
architecture's normal floating point format) of the correct size for
<var>bitsize</var>.  The default is <code>int</code>.

     <br><dt><var>group</var><dd>The register group to which this register belongs.  It must
be either <code>general</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>vector</code>.  If no
<var>group</var> is specified, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not display the register
in <code>info registers</code>.

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-predefined-types-3571"></a>
Type definitions in the self-description can build up composite types
from basic building blocks, but can not define fundamental types.  Instead,
standard identifiers are provided by <span class="sc">gdb</span> for the fundamental
types.  The currently supported types are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>int8</code><dt><code>int16</code><dt><code>int32</code><dt><code>int64</code><dt><code>int128</code><dd>Signed integer types holding the specified number of bits.

     <br><dt><code>uint8</code><dt><code>uint16</code><dt><code>uint32</code><dt><code>uint64</code><dt><code>uint128</code><dd>Unsigned integer types holding the specified number of bits.

     <br><dt><code>code_ptr</code><dt><code>data_ptr</code><dd>Pointers to unspecified code and data.  The program counter and
any dedicated return address register may be marked as code
pointers; printing a code pointer converts it into a symbolic
address.  The stack pointer and any dedicated address registers
may be marked as data pointers.

     <br><dt><code>ieee_single</code><dd>Single precision IEEE floating point.

     <br><dt><code>ieee_double</code><dd>Double precision IEEE floating point.

     <br><dt><code>arm_fpa_ext</code><dd>The 12-byte extended precision format used by ARM FPA registers.

     <br><dt><code>i387_ext</code><dd>The 10-byte extended precision format used by x87 registers.

<h3 class="section">G.4 Standard Target Features</h3>

<p><a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-standard-features-3572"></a>
A target description must contain either no registers or all the
target's registers.  If the description contains no registers, then
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will assume a default register layout, selected based on
the architecture.  If the description contains any registers, the
default layout will not be used; the standard registers must be
described in the target description, in such a way that <span class="sc">gdb</span>
can recognize them.

   <p>This is accomplished by giving specific names to feature elements
which contain standard registers.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will look for features
with those names and verify that they contain the expected registers;
if any known feature is missing required registers, or if any required
feature is missing, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will reject the target
description.  You can add additional registers to any of the
standard features &mdash; <span class="sc">gdb</span> will display them just as if
they were added to an unrecognized feature.

   <p>This section lists the known features and their expected contents. 
Sample XML documents for these features are included in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> source tree, in the directory <samp><span class="file">gdb/features</span></samp>.

   <p>Names recognized by <span class="sc">gdb</span> should include the name of the
company or organization which selected the name, and the overall
architecture to which the feature applies; so e.g. the feature
containing ARM core registers is named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The names of registers are not case sensitive for the purpose
of recognizing standard features, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> will only display
registers using the capitalization used in the description.

   <p>Users of <span class="sc">gdb</span> often wish to obtain information about the state of
the operating system running on the target&mdash;for example the list of
processes, or the list of open files.  This section describes the
mechanism that makes it possible.  This mechanism is similar to the
target features mechanism (see <a href="#Target-Descriptions">Target Descriptions</a>), but focuses
on a different aspect of target.

   <p>Operating system information is retrived from the target via the
remote protocol, using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer</span></samp>&rsquo; requests (see <a href="#qXfer-osdata-read">qXfer osdata read</a>).  The object name in the request should be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">osdata</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
the <var>annex</var> identifies the data to be fetched.

When requesting the process list, the <var>annex</var> field in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qXfer</span></samp>&rsquo; request should be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">processes</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The returned data is
an XML document.  The formal syntax of this document is defined in
<samp><span class="file">gdb/features/osdata.dtd</span></samp>.

   <p>An example document is:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
     &lt;!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "osdata.dtd"&gt;
     &lt;osdata type="processes"&gt;

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix I Trace File Format</h2>

<p><a name="index-trace-file-format-3587"></a>
The trace file comes in three parts: a header, a textual description
section, and a trace frame section with binary data.

   <p>The header has the form <code>\x7fTRACE0\n</code>.  The first byte is
<code>0x7f</code> so as to indicate that the file contains binary data,
while the <code>0</code> is a version number that may have different values
in the future.

   <p>The description section consists of multiple lines of <span class="sc">ascii</span> text
separated by newline characters (<code>0xa</code>).  The lines may include a
variety of optional descriptive or context-setting information, such
as tracepoint definitions or register set size.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will
ignore any line that it does not recognize.  An empty line marks the end
of this section.

<!-- FIXME add some specific types of data -->
   <p>The trace frame section consists of a number of consecutive frames. 
Each frame begins with a two-byte tracepoint number, followed by a
four-byte size giving the amount of data in the frame.  The data in
the frame consists of a number of blocks, each introduced by a
character indicating its type (at least register, memory, and trace
state variable).  The data in this section is raw binary, not a
hexadecimal or other encoding; its endianness matches the target's
endianness.

<!-- FIXME bi-arch may require endianness/arch info in description section -->
     <dl>
<dt><code>R </code><var>bytes</var><dd>Register block.  The number and ordering of bytes matches that of a
<code>g</code> packet in the remote protocol.  Note that these are the
actual bytes, in target order and <span class="sc">gdb</span> register order, not a
hexadecimal encoding.

     <br><dt><code>M </code><var>address</var> <var>length</var> <var>bytes</var><code>...</code><dd>Memory block.  This is a contiguous block of memory, at the 8-byte
address <var>address</var>, with a 2-byte length <var>length</var>, followed by
<var>length</var> bytes.

     <br><dt><code>V </code><var>number</var> <var>value</var><dd>Trace state variable block.  This records the 8-byte signed value
<var>value</var> of trace state variable numbered <var>number</var>.

   </dl>

   <p>Future enhancements of the trace file format may include additional types
of blocks.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix J <code>.gdb_index</code> section format</h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002egdb_005findex-section-format-3588"></a><a name="index-index-section-format-3589"></a>
This section documents the index section that is created by <code>save
gdb-index</code> (see <a href="#Index-Files">Index Files</a>).  The index section is
DWARF-specific; some knowledge of DWARF is assumed in this
description.

   <p>The mapped index file format is designed to be directly
<code>mmap</code>able on any architecture.  In most cases, a datum is
represented using a little-endian 32-bit integer value, called an
<code>offset_type</code>.  Big endian machines must byte-swap the values
before using them.  Exceptions to this rule are noted.  The data is
laid out such that alignment is always respected.

   <p>A mapped index consists of several areas, laid out in order.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The file header.  This is a sequence of values, of <code>offset_type</code>
unless otherwise noted:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The version number, currently 8.  Versions 1, 2 and 3 are obsolete. 
Version 4 uses a different hashing function from versions 5 and 6. 
Version 6 includes symbols for inlined functions, whereas versions 4
and 5 do not.  Version 7 adds attributes to the CU indices in the
symbol table.  Version 8 specifies that symbols from DWARF type units
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DW_TAG_type_unit</span></samp>&rsquo;) refer to the type unit's symbol table and not the
compilation unit (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DW_TAG_comp_unit</span></samp>&rsquo;) using the type.

          <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> will only read version 4, 5, or 6 indices
by specifying <code>set use-deprecated-index-sections on</code>. 
GDB has a workaround for potentially broken version 7 indices so it is
currently not flagged as deprecated.

          <li>The offset, from the start of the file, of the CU list.

          <li>The offset, from the start of the file, of the types CU list.  Note
that this area can be empty, in which case this offset will be equal
to the next offset.

          <li>The offset, from the start of the file, of the address area.

          <li>The offset, from the start of the file, of the symbol table.

          <li>The offset, from the start of the file, of the constant pool.
          </ol>

     <li>The CU list.  This is a sequence of pairs of 64-bit little-endian
values, sorted by the CU offset.  The first element in each pair is
the offset of a CU in the <code>.debug_info</code> section.  The second
element in each pair is the length of that CU.  References to a CU
elsewhere in the map are done using a CU index, which is just the
0-based index into this table.  Note that if there are type CUs, then
conceptually CUs and type CUs form a single list for the purposes of
CU indices.

     <li>The types CU list.  This is a sequence of triplets of 64-bit
little-endian values.  In a triplet, the first value is the CU offset,
the second value is the type offset in the CU, and the third value is
the type signature.  The types CU list is not sorted.

     <li>The address area.  The address area consists of a sequence of address
entries.  Each address entry has three elements:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The low address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.

          <li>The high address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.  Like
<code>DW_AT_high_pc</code>, the value is one byte beyond the end.

          <li>The CU index.  This is an <code>offset_type</code> value.
          </ol>

     <li>The symbol table.  This is an open-addressed hash table.  The size of
the hash table is always a power of 2.

     <p>Each slot in the hash table consists of a pair of <code>offset_type</code>
values.  The first value is the offset of the symbol's name in the
constant pool.  The second value is the offset of the CU vector in the
constant pool.

     <p>If both values are 0, then this slot in the hash table is empty.  This
is ok because while 0 is a valid constant pool index, it cannot be a
valid index for both a string and a CU vector.

     <p>The hash value for a table entry is computed by applying an
iterative hash function to the symbol's name.  Starting with an
initial value of <code>r = 0</code>, each (unsigned) character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the string is incorporated into the hash using the formula depending on the
index version:

          <dl>
<dt>Version 4<dd>The formula is <code>r = r * 67 + c - 113</code>.

          <br><dt>Versions 5 to 7<dd>The formula is <code>r = r * 67 + tolower (c) - 113</code>. 
</dl>

     <p>The terminating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\0</span></samp>&rsquo; is not incorporated into the hash.

     <p>The step size used in the hash table is computed via
<code>((hash * 17) &amp; (size - 1)) | 1</code>, where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hash</span></samp>&rsquo; is the hash
value, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">size</span></samp>&rsquo; is the size of the hash table.  The step size
is used to find the next candidate slot when handling a hash
collision.

     <p>The names of C<tt>++</tt> symbols in the hash table are canonicalized.  We
don't currently have a simple description of the canonicalization
algorithm; if you intend to create new index sections, you must read
the code.

     <li>The constant pool.  This is simply a bunch of bytes.  It is organized
so that alignment is correct: CU vectors are stored first, followed by
strings.

     <p>A CU vector in the constant pool is a sequence of <code>offset_type</code>
values.  The first value is the number of CU indices in the vector. 
Each subsequent value is the index and symbol attributes of a CU in
the CU list.  This element in the hash table is used to indicate which
CUs define the symbol and how the symbol is used. 
See below for the format of each CU index+attributes entry.

     <p>A string in the constant pool is zero-terminated.
        </ol>

   <p>Attributes were added to CU index values in <code>.gdb_index</code> version 7. 
If a symbol has multiple uses within a CU then there is one
CU index+attributes value for each use.

   <p>The format of each CU index+attributes entry is as follows
(bit 0 = LSB):

     <dl>
<dt>Bits 0-23<dd>This is the index of the CU in the CU list. 
<br><dt>Bits 24-27<dd>These bits are reserved for future purposes and must be zero. 
<br><dt>Bits 28-30<dd>The kind of the symbol in the CU.

          <dl>
<dt>0<dd>This value is reserved and should not be used. 
By reserving zero the full <code>offset_type</code> value is backwards compatible
with previous versions of the index. 
<br><dt>1<dd>The symbol is a type. 
<br><dt>2<dd>The symbol is a variable or an enum value. 
<br><dt>3<dd>The symbol is a function. 
<br><dt>4<dd>Any other kind of symbol. 
<br><dt>5,6,7<dd>These values are reserved. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>Bit 31<dd>This bit is zero if the value is global and one if it is static.

     <p>The determination of whether a symbol is global or static is complicated. 
The authorative reference is the file <samp><span class="file">dwarf2read.c</span></samp> in
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sources.

   </dl>

   <p>This pseudo-code describes the computation of a symbol's kind and
global/static attributes in the index.

<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION gdb -->
   <p>The purpose of a debugger such as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is to allow you to see what is
going on &ldquo;inside&rdquo; another program while it executes &ndash; or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

     <ul>
<li>Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

     <li>Make your program stop on specified conditions.

     <li>Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

     <li>Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another. 
</ul>

   <p>You can use <span class="sc">gdb</span> to debug programs written in C, C<tt>++</tt>, Fortran and
Modula-2.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> is invoked with the shell command <code>gdb</code>.  Once started, it reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
command <code>quit</code>.  You can get online help from <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself
by using the command <code>help</code>.

   <p>You can run <code>gdb</code> with no arguments or options; but the most
usual way to start <span class="sc">gdb</span> is with one argument or two, specifying an
executable program as the argument:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb program
</pre>
   <p>You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb program core
</pre>
   <p>You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:

<pre class="smallexample">     gdb program 1234
     gdb -p 1234
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would attach <span class="sc">gdb</span> to process <code>1234</code> (unless you also have a file
named <samp><span class="file">1234</span></samp>; <span class="sc">gdb</span> does check for a core file first). 
With option <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> you can omit the <var>program</var> filename.

   <p>Here are some of the most frequently needed <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands:

<!-- pod2man highlights the right hand side of the @item lines. -->
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="env">break [</span><var>file</var><span class="env">:]</span><var>functiop</var></samp><dd>Set a breakpoint at <var>function</var> (in <var>file</var>).

about using <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">quit</span></samp><dd>Exit from <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
</dl>

<!-- man end -->
<!-- man begin OPTIONS gdb -->
   <p>Any arguments other than options specify an executable
file and core file (or process ID); that is, the first argument
encountered with no
associated option flag is equivalent to a <samp><span class="option">-se</span></samp> option, and the second,
if any, is equivalent to a <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option if it's the name of a file. 
Many options have
both long and short forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also
recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option is
present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can flag option
arguments with <samp><span class="option">+</span></samp> rather than <samp><span class="option">-</span></samp>, though we illustrate the
more usual convention.)

   <p>All the options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>

gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>prog</var> [<var>args</var><small class="dots">...</small>]

gdbserver &ndash;attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>

gdbserver &ndash;multi <var>comm</var>
<!-- man end -->
</pre>
<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION gdbserver -->
   <p><samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> is a program that allows you to run <span class="sc">gdb</span> on a different machine
than the one which is running the program being debugged.

<h4 class="subheading">Usage (server (target) side)</h4>

   <p>First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put onto
the target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if needed, as
<samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> doesn't care about symbols.  All symbol handling is taken care of by
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> running on the host system.

   <p>To use the server, you log on to the target system, and run the <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp>
program.  You must tell it (a) how to communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span>, (b) the name of
your program, and (c) its arguments.  The general syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>program</var> [<var>args</var> ...]
</pre>
   <p>For example, using a serial port, you might say:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver <samp><span class="file">/dev/com1</span></samp> emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p>This tells <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> to debug emacs with an argument of foo.txt, and
to communicate with <span class="sc">gdb</span> via <samp><span class="file">/dev/com1</span></samp>.  <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> now
waits patiently for the host <span class="sc">gdb</span> to communicate with it.

   <p>To use a TCP connection, you could say:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</pre>
   <p>This says pretty much the same thing as the last example, except that we are
going to communicate with the <code>host</code> <span class="sc">gdb</span> via TCP.  The <code>host:2345</code> argument means
that we are expecting to see a TCP connection from <code>host</code> to local TCP port
2345.  (Currently, the <code>host</code> part is ignored.)  You can choose any number you
want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any existing TCP
ports on the target system.  This same port number must be used in the host
<span class="sc">gdb</span>s <code>target remote</code> command, which will be described shortly.  Note that if
you chose a port number that conflicts with another service, <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> will
print an error message and exit.

   <p><samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> can also attach to running programs. 
This is accomplished via the <samp><span class="option">--attach</span></samp> argument.  The syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre>
   <p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary to point <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> at a binary for the running process.

   <p>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use the <samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> command line option. 
In such case you should connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> to start
the program you want to debug.

<pre class="smallexample">     target&gt; gdbserver --multi <var>comm</var>
</pre>
   <h4 class="subheading">Usage (host side)</h4>

   <p>You need an unstripped copy of the target program on your host system, since
<span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to examine it's symbol tables and such.  Start up <span class="sc">gdb</span> as you normally
would, with the target program as the first argument.  (You may need to use the
<samp><span class="option">--baud</span></samp> option if the serial line is running at anything except 9600 baud.) 
That is <code>gdb TARGET-PROG</code>, or <code>gdb --baud BAUD TARGET-PROG</code>.  After that, the only
new command you need to know about is <code>target remote</code>
(or <code>target extended-remote</code>).  Its argument is either
a device name (usually a serial device, like <samp><span class="file">/dev/ttyb</span></samp>), or a <code>HOST:PORT</code>
descriptor.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) target remote <samp><span class="file">/dev/ttyb</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">communicates with the server via serial line <samp><span class="file">/dev/ttyb</span></samp>, and:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) target remote the-target:2345
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">communicates via a TCP connection to port 2345 on host `the-target', where
you previously started up <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> with the same port number.  Note that for
TCP connections, you must start up <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> prior to using the `target remote'
command, otherwise you may get an error that looks something like
`Connection refused'.

   <p><samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> can also debug multiple inferiors at once,
described in
<a href="#Inferiors-and-Programs">Inferiors and Programs</a>. 
In such case use the <code>extended-remote</code> <span class="sc">gdb</span> command variant:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) target extended-remote the-target:2345
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> option <samp><span class="option">--multi</span></samp> may or may not be used in such
case. 
<!-- man end -->

<!-- man begin OPTIONS gdbserver -->
   <p>There are three different modes for invoking <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp>:

     <ul>
<li>Debug a specific program specified by its program name:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>prog</var> [<var>args</var>...]
</pre>
     <p>The <var>comm</var> parameter specifies how should the server communicate
with <span class="sc">gdb</span>; it is either a device name (to use a serial line),
a TCP port number (<code>:1234</code>), or <code>-</code> or <code>stdio</code> to use
stdin/stdout of <code>gdbserver</code>.  Specify the name of the program to
debug in <var>prog</var>.  Any remaining arguments will be passed to the
program verbatim.  When the program exits, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will close the
connection, and <code>gdbserver</code> will exit.

     <li>Debug a specific program by specifying the process ID of a running
program:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre>
     <p>The <var>comm</var> parameter is as described above.  Supply the process ID
of a running program in <var>pid</var>; <span class="sc">gdb</span> will do everything
else.  Like with the previous mode, when the process <var>pid</var> exits,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will close the connection, and <code>gdbserver</code> will exit.

     <li>Multi-process mode &ndash; debug more than one program/process:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gdbserver --multi <var>comm</var>
</pre>
     <p>In this mode, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can instruct <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> which
command(s) to run.  Unlike the other 2 modes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will not
close the connection when a process being debugged exits, so you can
debug several processes in the same session. 
</ul>

   <p>In each of the modes you may specify these options:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="env">--help</span></samp><dd>List all options, with brief explanations.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--version</span></samp><dd>This option causes <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> to print its version number and exit.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--attach</span></samp><dd><samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> will attach to a running program.  The syntax is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre>
     <p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary to point <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> at a binary for the running process.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--multi</span></samp><dd>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use this command line option. 
Then you can connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> and start
the program you want to debug.  The syntax is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          target&gt; gdbserver --multi <var>comm</var>
</pre>
     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--debug</span></samp><dd>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to display extra status information about the debugging
process. 
This option is intended for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to
the developers.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--remote-debug</span></samp><dd>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to display remote protocol debug output. 
This option is intended for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to
the developers.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--debug-format=option1[,option2,...]</span></samp><dd>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to include extra information in each line
of debugging output. 
See <a href="#Other-Command_002dLine-Arguments-for-gdbserver">Other Command-Line Arguments for gdbserver</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--wrapper</span></samp><dd>Specify a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
<kbd>--</kbd> indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">--once</span></samp><dd>By default, <samp><span class="command">gdbserver</span></samp> keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
additional connections are possible.  However, if you start <code>gdbserver</code>
with the <samp><span class="option">--once</span></samp> option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first <span class="sc">gdb</span> session.

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

   <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. 
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

   <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>Definitions.

     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.

     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.

     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

     <li>Source Code.

     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
of a work.

     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

     <li>Basic Permissions.

     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
notices&rdquo;.

          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
          </ol>

     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

          </ol>

     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

     <li>Additional Terms.

     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
          </ol>

     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

     <li>Termination.

     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

     <li>Patents.

     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.

     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

     <li>Revised Versions of this License.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

     <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

     <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

     <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

     <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

     <li>Limitation of Liability.

     <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     <li>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.

   <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But
first, please read <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html</a>.

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->
<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and

Note that some side effects are easier to undo than others.  For instance,
memory and registers are relatively easy, but device I/O is hard.  Some
targets may be able undo things like device I/O, and some may not.

   <p>The contract between <span class="sc">gdb</span> and the reverse executing target
requires only that the target do something reasonable when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> tells it to execute backwards, and then report the
results back to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Whatever the target reports back to
<span class="sc">gdb</span>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will report back to the user.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
assumes that the memory and registers that the target reports are in a
consistant state, but <span class="sc">gdb</span> accepts whatever it is given.

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-8" href="#fnd-8">8</a>]</small> 
Note that embedded programs (the so-called &ldquo;free-standing&rdquo;
environment) are not required to have a <code>main</code> function as the
entry point.  They could even have multiple entry points.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-9" href="#fnd-9">9</a>]</small> 
The only restriction is that your editor (say <code>ex</code>), recognizes the
following command-line syntax:
<pre class="smallexample">     ex +<var>number</var> file
</pre>
   <p>The optional numeric value +<var>number</var> specifies the number of the line in
the file where to start editing.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-10" href="#fnd-10">10</a>]</small> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be used because these format letters are also
used with the <code>x</code> command, where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for &ldquo;byte&rdquo;;
see <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> This is a way of removing
one word from the stack, on machines where stacks grow downward in
memory (most machines, nowadays).  This assumes that the innermost
stack frame is selected; setting <code>$sp</code> is not allowed when other
stack frames are selected.  To pop entire frames off the stack,
regardless of machine architecture, use <code>return</code>;
see <a href="#Returning">Returning from a Function</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> In non-stop mode, it is moderately
rare for a running thread to modify the stack of a stopped thread
in a way that would interfere with a backtrace, and caching of
stack reads provides a significant speed up of remote backtraces.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> This is the
minimum.  Recent versions of <span class="sc">gcc</span> support <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-3</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-gdwarf-4</span></samp>; we recommend always choosing the most recent
version of DWARF.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> Historically the
functionality to retrieve binaries from the remote system was
provided by prefixing <var>path</var> with <samp><span class="file">remote:</span></samp></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> If you choose a port number that
conflicts with another service, <code>gdbserver</code> prints an error message
and exits.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> The register named with capital letters represent the architecture
registers.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-17" href="#fnd-17">17</a>]</small> Note that <span class="sc">gdb</span> parameters must not be confused with
Guile’s parameter objects (see <a href="guile.html#Parameters">Parameters</a>).</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-18" href="#fnd-18">18</a>]</small> In
<samp><span class="file">gdb-7.10 for GNAT Community 2019/gdb/refcard.ps</span></samp> of the version 7.10 for GNAT Community 2019
release.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-19" href="#fnd-19">19</a>]</small> The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qP</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qL</span></samp>&rsquo;
packets predate these conventions, and have arguments without any terminator
for the packet name; we suspect they are in widespread use in places that
are difficult to upgrade.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qC</span></samp>&rsquo; packet has no arguments, but some
existing stubs (e.g. RedBoot) are known to not check for the end of the
packet.</p>
