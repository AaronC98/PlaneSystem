<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">

<p>The main goal for the development cycle of GPS 18 was to improve
stability, and a better experience for newcomers.
It includes a number of new features as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="preferences-assistant-welcome-dialog">
<h2>Preferences Assistant &amp; Welcome Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences-assistant-welcome-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When starting GPS for the first time, a preferences assistant
wizard allows you to quickly customize GPS to your preferred way
of working. You&#8217;ll be able to change the following settings through
this dialog:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>color themes</li>
<li>key shortcuts theme</li>
<li>general settings</li>
<li>plugins</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<img alt="_images/preferences-assistant-3.png" src="_images/preferences-assistant-3.png" />
<img alt="_images/preferences-assistant-4.png" src="_images/preferences-assistant-4.png" />
<p>The GPS welcome dialog has been reworked: a list of recently opened projects is
now displayed on the left side.</p>
<img alt="_images/welcome-dialog.png" src="_images/welcome-dialog.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control-support">
<h2>Version Control Support<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The support of the version control system has been rewritten from scratch.
Multiple version control systems and repositories are supported within the
loaded project tree. The VCS Explorer and VCS Activities views have been
replaced with new views. The Project and Files views now show the VCS status
for files.</p>
<img alt="_images/vcs-projects.png" src="_images/vcs-projects.png" />
<p>The History view shows the set of commits that were done in the repository
in the past, along with a graphical diagram showing how branches were
created or joined. This makes it easier to understand how the commits relate
to one another.</p>
<img alt="_images/vcs-history.png" src="_images/vcs-history.png" />
<p>The Branches view lets you view and switch between existing branches, to create
new branches, and to delete branches. If you are using git, you can also use
this view to apply view stashed commits.</p>
<img alt="_images/vcs-branches.png" src="_images/vcs-branches.png" />
<p>Support has been added to execute special VCS operations when a
file needs to be made writable (which is useful for ClearCase,
for instance).</p>
<p>All VCS operations are now performed much more efficiently, and
getting the status for objects is almost instantaneous on most
working directories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugger">
<h2>Debugger<a class="headerlink" href="#debugger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Assembler</span> view highlights assembler instructions, registers and
addresses. It has a local toolbar for quick access to disassembly operations.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Variables</span> view allows to control format (display base) of
variables via the contextual menu.</p>
<p>The <span class="menuselection">Debug ‣ Print</span> contextual menus have been reintroduced in
GPS.</p>
<p>The Debug section of the contextual menu provides entries to control
breakpoints (set, remove, disable, enable).</p>
<p>The GDB/MI protocol is supported and can be activated via the <span class="guilabel">Debugger</span>
section of the Preferences dialog.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="test-view">
<h2>Test View<a class="headerlink" href="#test-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new dedicated <span class="guilabel">Test</span> view&#8217; was added to present tests, test cases and
corresponding sources available in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outline">
<h2>Outline<a class="headerlink" href="#outline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The expanded/collapsed state of the &#8220;withs&#8221; node is now preserved when switching
between sources.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Outline View</span> is now able to present entities grouped by
categories. This is enabled via a new preference <span class="guilabel">Group by category</span>,
and works only in flat view mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="codefixes">
<h2>Codefixes<a class="headerlink" href="#codefixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code fixing capabilities was enchanced to handle more messages from the
compiler:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>loop expression is replaced by Range attribute when compiler detects that
Range attribute should be used to loop over the content of an array</li>
<li>removing of redundant &#8220;with&#8221; clauses now removes any accompanying &#8220;use&#8221; clauses</li>
<li>incorrect prefix of Result attribute replaced by the expected one</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflows">
<h2>Workflows<a class="headerlink" href="#workflows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <span class="guilabel">Build &amp; Run</span> and a <span class="guilabel">Build &amp; Debug</span> toobar button have
been introduced. Clicking on these buttons has for effect to build the selected
executable, and perform the second action (either <span class="guilabel">Run</span> or
<span class="guilabel">Debug</span>) if the build was successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projects-support">
<h2>Projects Support<a class="headerlink" href="#projects-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <cite>Interfaces</cite> attribute is now editable from the
<span class="menuselection">Library ‣ Standalone</span> page of the
<span class="guilabel">Project Properties</span> editor.</p>
<p>GPS no longer offers to edit project properties of a read-only project file.</p>
<p>A new attribute <cite>Read_Only</cite> can be placed in the IDE package of a project to
prevent GPS from displaying the graphical editor on this project.</p>
<p>When applying changes made in <span class="guilabel">Project Properties</span> to all the
possible values of a given scenario variable, no useless switch case is written
in the resulting .gpr file.</p>
<p>We no longer display the list of entities defined in a file, in the
<span class="guilabel">Project</span> view. This information is already available in the Outline,
whenever a file is selected in the Project view. Removing it allowed us to
speed up the display of the tree view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search-replace">
<h2>Search &amp; Replace<a class="headerlink" href="#search-replace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The GPS <span class="guilabel">Search</span> view has been completely revamped. The usability has
been improved and an interactive mode has been added.</p>
<img alt="_images/search-dialog.png" src="_images/search-dialog.png" />
<p>Every Search/Replace action is now available from the keyboard.</p>
<p>The number of entries in the <span class="guilabel">Search</span> view combobox is now limited to
5 when the view is spawned. A separator has also been added between the
predefined regexps and the previously searched patterns.</p>
<p>GPS now reports in the <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> window the number of occurrences
that have been replaced when <span class="guilabel">Replace All</span> button of the
<span class="guilabel">Search</span> view is clicked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-editor">
<h2>Source Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#source-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new status indicator has been placed in the bottom-right corner of source
editors, showing whether the editor has been modified.</p>
<p>A new action <span class="guilabel">insert extended character</span> has been added, allowing one
to enter an extended character in the editor by its unicode number.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gnatdoc">
<h2>GNATdoc<a class="headerlink" href="#gnatdoc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GNATdoc is now able to process bodies, and extract documentation from bodies
and generate separate pages for these bodies in the resulting HTML output. This
is activated via the command-line switch &#8216;-d&#8217;.</p>
<p>GNATdoc now supports processing Ada 83 and Ada 95 codebases, in addition to Ada
2005 and 2012.</p>
<p>Detailed information is generated for task and protected objects, including
their subprograms and entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="miscellaneous-ui-improvements">
<h2>Miscellaneous UI improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#miscellaneous-ui-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Key shortcuts are now displayed in GPS contextual menus.</p>
<p>The menu separators have been made more visible in dark themes.</p>
<p>Icons were added in the Window menu for editors. This allows displaying which
editors are currently modified.</p>
<p>The labels containing the base name and directory of a file in the
<span class="guilabel">Properties</span> dialog are now selectable, which means you can
copy/paste from them.</p>
<p>GNAT runtime menu items for cross platforms have been moved into a separate
submenu of <span class="menuselection">Help ‣ GNAT</span> runtime instead of placing them after
Help/About submenu.</p>
<p>GPS now includes a new button to the right of the main toolbar, to let users
easily switch perspectives.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Go declaration ...</span> item is no longer shown when the subprogram
does not have a declaration. Instead, the contextual menu only shows
<span class="guilabel">Goto body ...</span>.</p>
<p>The local configuration menu of the <span class="guilabel">Locations</span> view now contains an
item <span class="guilabel">Preserve message</span> to control whether to keep build messages for
files that are not being recompiled.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Files</span> view now reuses the same preference as the Project view
to hide some files (those starting with &#8221;.&#8221; by default, although this can be
configured in the preferences dialog).</p>
<p>Creating <span class="guilabel">Projects</span> and <span class="guilabel">Files</span> views is now much faster,
in particular on large projects where a directory contains several thousands of
files.</p>
<p>A <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Project ‣ Add Complex File Naming Conventions</span>
menu has been added to run GNATname on project loaded by GPS.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Memory Usage View</span> has been improved. It is now able to display
the static memory usage for memory regions, sections and object files, even
when the link has failed.</p>
<p>If the <span class="guilabel">Metrics</span> view is already present, GPS will reuse it when
computing metrics of a file/project.</p>
<p>Deployment of examples: GPS now asks to specify a directory for deploying
GNAT examples via the HELP/GNAT/Examples menus, rather than opening examples
in the location where they are installed.</p>
<p>New contextual menus have been added to create new files from
templates (e.g: &#8216;New Ada Package&#8217; contextual menu in the Project
View). These templates are derived from the aliases mechanism and
a Python API has been introduced to allow users to create their
own templates.</p>

<div class="section" id="gps-customization">
<h2>GPS Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#gps-customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="python-api">
<h3>Python API<a class="headerlink" href="#python-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A new method GPS.Message.create_nested_message has been added to create nested
messages.</p>
<p>It is now possible to create Tasks from the Python API, and to create tasks
that monitor a workflow. This can conveniently replace some uses of the
<cite>GPS.Timeout</cite> API, and integrates within the GPS Task Manager, allowing to
provide progress indication for background tasks.</p>
<p>Python API of Libadalang is available for plugins, and can be used in GPS
plugins to implement custom code checkers.</p>
<p>The <cite>GPS.Debugger</cite> provides new methods to manipulate frames - <cite>current_frame</cite>,
<cite>frame_down</cite>, <cite>frame_up</cite>, <cite>frames</cite>, <cite>select_frame</cite>.</p>
<p>The scripting API has been enhanced with an <cite>add_debounce</cite> method which can be
used to schedule callbacks to be called as soon as GPS is idle.</p>

<h3>Mac OS<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-os" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Mac OS Key shortcuts theme has been introduced in GPS, using the
Command key instead of the control key in many places, and defines common Mac OS
(e.g: &#8216;control + a&#8217; to go to the beginning of the current line).</p>
