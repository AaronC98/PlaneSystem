<img alt="_images/gps-main-window.png" src="_images/gps-main-window.png" />
<p>The GNAT Programming Studio has one main window, which is where you perform
most of your work.  However, GPS is very flexible and lets you
organize your desktop many different ways, as discussed in a later section
(<a class="reference internal" href="mdi.html#multiple-document-interface"><span class="std std-ref">Multiple Document Interface</span></a>).</p>
<p>There are also other windows that might pop up at various times, documented
in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-workspace">
<span id="the-work-space"></span><h2>2.1. The Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#the-workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<span class="target" id="index-1"></span><span class="target" id="index-2"></span><span class="target" id="index-3"></span><p id="index-4">The overall workspace is based on a multiple document interface (see
<a class="reference internal" href="mdi.html#multiple-document-interface"><span class="std std-ref">Multiple Document Interface</span></a>) and can contain any number of windows,
the most important of which are usually the editors. However, GPS also
provides a large number of views that you can add to the workspace. The
sections below list them.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-features-of-the-views">
<h3>2.1.1. Common features of the views<a class="headerlink" href="#common-features-of-the-views" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-5"></span><p id="index-6">Some views are part of the default desktop and are visible by default.
Open the other views through one of the submenus of the
<span class="menuselection">View</span> menu.</p>
<p id="index-7">Some of the views have their own local toolbar that contains shortcuts to
the most often used features of that view.</p>
<p id="index-8">There is often a button to the right of these local toolbars that opens a
local settings menu. This menu either contains more actions you can perform
in that view or various configuration settings allowing you to change the
behavior or display of the view.</p>
<p id="index-9">Some views also have a filter in their local toolbar.  You can use these
filters to reduce the amount of information displayed on the screen by only
displaying those lines matching the filter.</p>
<p>If you click on the left icon of the filter, GPS brings up a popup menu to
allow you to configure the filter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use the first three entries to choose the search algorithm (full text
match, regular expression, or fuzzy matching). These modes are similar to
the ones used in the omni-search (see <a class="reference internal" href="#omni-search"><span class="std std-ref">The omni-search</span></a>).</li>
<li>The next entry is <span class="guilabel">Invert filter</span>. When you select this
option, lines that do not match the filter are displayed, instead of
the default behavior of displaying ones that match the filter.  You
can also enable this mode temporarily by beginning the filter with
the string <code class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">not:</span></code>. For example, a filter in the
<span class="guilabel">Locations</span> view saying <code class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">not:warning</span></code> hides all warning
messages.</li>
<li>Select the last entry, <span class="guilabel">Whole word</span>, when you only want to
match full words, not substrings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-features-of-browsers">
<span id="browsers-features"></span><h3>2.1.2. Common features of browsers<a class="headerlink" href="#common-features-of-browsers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GPS presents a view of information using an interactive display called a
&#8220;browser&#8221;, which shows a canvas containing boxes you can manipulate.
Browsers provide the following additional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Links</p>
<p>Boxes can be linked together and remain linked when they are moved.  There
are different types of links; see the description of the various browsers
for more details.</p>
<p>Hide links using a button on the local toolbar. This keeps the
canvas more readable at the cost of losing information.  You can also
hide only a subset of links. Even when links are hidden, if you select a
box, boxes linked to it are still highlighted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Scrolling</p>
<p>When many boxes are displayed, the currently visible area may be too
small for all of them.  When that happens, GPS adds scrollbars. You can
also scroll using the arrow keys, or by dragging the background while
pressing the left mouse button.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Layout</p>
<p>GPS organizes the boxes in a browser using a simple layout algorithm,
which is layer oriented: items with no parents are put in the first
layer, their direct children are put in the second layer, and so
on. Depending on the type of browser, these layers are organized either
vertically or horizontally.  If you move boxes, this algorithm tries to
preserve their relative positions as much as possible.</p>
<p>Use the <span class="guilabel">Refresh layout</span> button in the local toolbar to
recompute the layout at any time, including that of boxes you moved.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Moving boxes</p>
<p>Move boxes with the mouse. Drag the box by clicking on its title
bar. The box&#8217;s links are still displayed during the move, so you can see
whether it overlaps any other box. If you try to move the box outside the
visible part of the browser, it is scrolled.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Selecting boxes</p>
<p>Select a box by clicking it.</p>
<p>The title bar of selected boxes is a different color.  All boxes linked
to them also use a different title bar color and so do the links. This is
the most convenient way to visualize the relationships between boxes when
many are present in the browser.</p>
<p>Use buttons in the local toolbar to either remove the selected boxes or
remove the boxes that are not selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Zooming</p>
<p>GPS provides several different zoom levels.  Use the
<span class="guilabel">zoom in</span>, <span class="guilabel">zoom out</span>, and <span class="guilabel">zoom</span> buttons in
the local toolbar to change the level and use the latter to explicitly
select the level you want.</p>
<p>You can also press the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">alt</span></code> key and use the mouse wheel to zoom in
or out.</p>
<p>This capability is generally useful when many boxes are displayed in the
browser to allow you to get an overview of the layout and the
relationships between the boxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="target" id="index-10"></span>export</p>
<p>Export the entire contents of a browser as a <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">PNG</span></code> or
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">SVG</span></code> image using the <span class="guilabel">Export to...</span> button in the
local toolbar.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Hyper-links</p>
<p>Some boxes contain hyper links, displayed in blue by default, and
underlined.  Clicking on these generally displays new boxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Contextual menus</p>
<p>Right-clicking on boxes displays a contextual menu with actions you can
perform on that box.  These actions are specific to the kind of box you
clicked.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Grid</p>
<p>By default, GPS doesn&#8217;t display a grid on the canvas. Use the local settings
menu to show the grid (uncheck <span class="guilabel">Draw grid</span>) or to force items to
align on the grid (<span class="guilabel">Align on grid</span>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="icons-for-source-language-entities">
<h4>2.1.2.1. Icons for source language entities<a class="headerlink" href="#icons-for-source-language-entities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Entities in the source code are represented by icons within the various GPS
views (for example, the <span class="guilabel">Outline</span> and <span class="guilabel">Project</span> views).
These icons indicate both the semantic category of the entity within the
language, such as packages and methods, as well as compile-time visibility.
The icons also distinguish entity declarations from other entities.  The
same icons are used for all programming languages supported by GPS, with
language-specific interpretations for both compile-time visibility and
distinguishing declarations and uses of entities.</p>
<p>These five language categories are used for all supported languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <em>package</em> category&#8217;s icon is a square.</p>
<img alt="_images/square_x.png" src="_images/square_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>subprogram</em> category&#8217;s icon is a circle.</p>
<img alt="_images/circle_x.png" src="_images/circle_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>type</em> category&#8217;s icon is a triangle.</p>
<img alt="_images/triangle_x.png" src="_images/triangle_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>variable</em> category&#8217;s icon is a dot.</p>
<img alt="_images/dot_x.png" src="_images/dot_x.png" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <em>generic</em> category&#8217;s icon is a diamond.</p>
<img alt="_images/diamond_x.png" src="_images/diamond_x.png" />
</li>
</ul>
<p>These icons are enhanced with decorations, when appropriate, to indicate
compile-time visibility constraints and to distinguish declarations from
completions. For example, icons for entity declarations have a small &#8216;S&#8217;
decorator added, denoting a &#8216;spec&#8217;.</p>
<p>Icons for &#8216;protected&#8217; and &#8216;private&#8217; entities appear within an enclosing box
indicating a compile-time visibility constraint. For entities with
&#8216;protected&#8217; visibility, the enclosing box is gray.  &#8216;Private&#8217; entities are
enclosed by a red box.  Icons for &#8216;public&#8217; entities have no enclosing
box. For example, a variable with &#8216;private&#8217; visibility is represented by an
icon consisting of a dot enclosed by a red box.  These additional
decorations are combined when appropriate. For example, the icon
corresponding to the &#8216;private&#8217; declaration of a &#8216;package&#8217; entity would be a
square, as for any package entity, with a small &#8216;S&#8217; added, all enclosed by
a red box.</p>
<p>Language constructs are mapped to categories in a language-specific manner.
For example, C++ namespaces and Ada packages correspond to the <em>package</em>
category and C functions and Ada subprograms correspond to the <em>method</em>
category.  The <em>generic</em> category is a general category representing other
language entities, but not all possible language constructs are mapped to
categories and icons.  (Specifically, the <em>generic</em> category does not
correspond to Ada generic units or C++ templates.)</p>
<p>The names of the categories should not be interpreted literally as language
constructs because the categories are meant to be general in order to limit
the number of categories.  For example, the <em>variable</em> category includes
both constants and variables in Ada. Limiting the number of categories
maintains a balance between presentation complexity and the need to support
many different programming languages.</p>
<p>Icons for a given entity may appear more than once within a view. For
example, an Ada private type has both a partial view in the visible part of
the enclosing package and a full view in the private part of the package.
A triangle icon will appear for each of the two occurrences of the type
name, one with the additional decoration indicating &#8216;private&#8217; visibility.</p>

<span class="target" id="index-15"></span><p id="index-16">When GPS starts, it looks for a project file to load so it knows where to
find the sources of your project. This project is often specified on the
command line (via a <strong class="command">-P</strong> switch).  If not, and the current
directory contains only one project file, GPS selects it automatically.
Finally, if you specify the name of a source file to edit, GPS loads a
default project.  If GPS cannot find a project file, it displays a welcome
dialog, giving you the following choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Create new project</span></p>
<p>Clicking on this button launches an assistant to create a project using one
of the predefined project templates. This makes it easy to create GtkAda-based
applications, or applications using the Ada Web Server, for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="index-17">
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Open project</span></p>
<p>Clicking on this button opens up a file browser, allowing you to select
a project file to load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="index-18">
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Start with default</span></p>
<p>Clicking on this button causes GPS to look for a project called
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">default.gpr</span></code> in the current directory and load it if found. Otherwise,
it copies the default project <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/gps/default.gpr</span></code> into the
current directory and loads it. GPS removes this temporary copy when exiting
or loading another project if you have not modified the copy.</p>
<p>The default project contains all the Ada source files from the specified
directory (assuming they use the default GNAT naming scheme <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ads</span></code> and
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.adb</span></code>).</p>
<p>If the current directory is not writable, GPS instead loads
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/gps/readonly.gpr</span></code>. In this case, GPS runs in a limited
mode, where some capabilities (such as building and source navigation) are not
available. This project will not contain any sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these choices, you can also load a recently opened project by
clicking the project of interest in the left-hand pane listing the known recent
projects.</p>

<img alt="_images/omnisearch.png" src="_images/omnisearch.png" />
<p>The final item in the toolbar is &#8220;omni-search&#8221;.  Use this to search for
text in various contexts in GPS, such as filenames (for convenient access
to source files), the entities referenced in your application, and your
code.</p>
<p>There are various ways to use the omni-search:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The simplest way is to click on it and type the pattern you want to
find. GPS immediately starts searching in the background for possible
matching open windows, file names, entities, GPS actions, bookmarks, and
source files. For each context, GPS display how many matches there are in
that context but only displays the five matches with the highest score.</p>
<p>Click on the name of context to search only in that context.  For
example, if GPS shows 20 file names matching your search (while only
displaying the five first), click on <span class="guilabel">file names</span> to view all
20 names and exclude the results from all the other contexts.  If you
click on the context again, GPS again displays the results from all
contexts.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you are searching in a single context, GPS defines a number of actions
to which you can bind key shortcuts via the
<span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Preferences...</span> dialog instead of using the
above procedure. These actions are
found in the <span class="guilabel">Search</span> category and are called <span class="guilabel">Global
Search in context:</span>. GPS includes a <span class="target" id="index-26"></span>menu for two of them by default: <span class="menuselection">Find ‣
Find File in Project</span> searches filenames, <span class="target" id="index-27"></span>while <span class="menuselection">Find ‣ Find Entity</span>
searches all entities defined in your project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each context displays its results slightly differently and clicking on a
result has different effects in each context. For example, clicking on a
file name opens the corresponding file, while clicking on an entity jumps
to its declaration and clicking on a bookmark displays the source file
containing the bookmark.</p>
<p>Press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">enter</span></code> at any point to select the top item in the list of
search results.</p>
<img alt="_images/omnisearch-settings.png" src="_images/omnisearch-settings.png" />
<p id="index-28">You may have no interest in some search contexts.  Disable them by clicking
the <span class="guilabel">Settings</span> icon at the bottom-right corner of the completion
popup. The resulting dialog displays a list of all contexts to be searched;
clicking on any of the checkboxes next to the names disables searching that
context.  This list is only displayed when you started the omni-search by
clicking on it in the toolbar. If you started it via <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">shift-F3</span></code> or the
equivalent <span class="menuselection">Find ‣ Find File in Project...</span> menu, only a
subset of the settings are displayed.</p>
<p>You can also reorder the contexts from this settings dialog, which affects
the order in which they are searched and displayed. We recommend keeping the
<span class="guilabel">Sources</span> context last, because it is the slowest and while GPS
is searching it, cannot search the other, faster, contexts.</p>
<p>In the settings dialog, you can choose whether to display a
<span class="guilabel">Preview</span> for the matches. This preview is displayed when you use
the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span> <span class="pre">arrow</span></code> key to select some of the search results.  It
displays the corresponding source file or the details for the matching GPS
action or bookmark.  You can also select the number of results to be
displayed for each context when multiple contexts are displayed or the size
of the search field (which depends on how big your screen and the GPS
window are).</p>
<p>One search context looks for file names and is convenient for quickly
opening files. By default, it looks at all files found in any of the source
directories of your project, even if those files are not explicit sources of
the project (for example because they do not match the naming scheme for any
of the languages used by the project). This is often convenient because you
can easily open support files like <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Makefiles</span></code> or documentation, but
it can also sometimes be annoying if the source directories include too
many irrelevant files. Use the <span class="guilabel">Include all files from source
dirs</span> setting to control this behavior.</p>
<p>GPS allows you to choose among various search algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Full Text</span> checks whether the text you typed appears exactly
as you specified it within the context (for example, a file name, the
contents of a file, or the name of an entity).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Regular Expression</span> assumes the text you typed is a valid
regular expression and searches for it. If it is not a valid regexp, it
tries to search for the exact text (like <span class="guilabel">Full Text</span>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Fuzzy Match</span> tries to find each of the characters you typed,
in that order, but possibly with extra characters in between.  This is
often the fastest way to search, but might requires a bit of getting used
to. For example, the text <code class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">mypks</span></code> matches the file name
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">MY_PacKage.adS</span></code> because the letters shown in upper cases are
contained in the filename.</p>
<p>When searching within source files, the algorithm is changed slightly, to
avoid having too many matches. In that context, GPS only allows a close
approximations between the text you typed and the text it tries to match
(for example, one or two extra or missing characters).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Select the algorithm to use at the bottom of the popup window containing
the search results.</p>
<p>Once it finds a match, GPS assigns it a score, used to order the results in
the most meaningful way for you. Scoring is based on a number of criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">length of the match</p>
<p>For example, when searching file names, it is more likely that typing
&#8216;foo&#8217; was intended to match &#8216;foo.ads&#8217; than &#8216;the_long_foo.ads&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the grouping of characters in the match</p>
<p>As we have seen, when doing a fuzzy match GPS allows extra characters
between the ones you typed. But the closer the ones you typed are in the
match result, the more likely it is that this is what you were looking for.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">when was the item last selected</p>
<p>If you recently selected an item (like a file name), GPS assumes you are
more likely to want it again and raises its score.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<img alt="_images/views-messages.png" src="_images/views-messages.png" />
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> view, which is read-only, displays information and
feedback about operations, including build output, information about
processes launched, and error messages.</p>
<p>Its local toolbar contains buttons to <span class="guilabel">Clear</span> the contents of the
window, as well as <span class="guilabel">Save</span> and <span class="guilabel">Load</span> from files.  The
latter operation also parses those messages into the <span class="guilabel">Locations</span>
window.</p>
<p>The actual output of the compilation is displayed in the
<span class="guilabel">Messages</span> view but is also parsed and many of its messages are
displayed more conveniently in the <span class="guilabel">Locations</span> view (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#the-locations-view"><span class="std std-ref">The Locations View</span></a>).  When a compilation finishes, GPS displays the
total elapsed time.</p>
<p id="index-32">You cannot close the <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> view because it might contain
important messages.  If GPS closed it, you can reopen it with the
<span class="menuselection">View ‣ Messages</span> menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-locations-view">
<span id="index-33"></span><span id="id5"></span><h2>2.7. The <span class="guilabel">Locations</span> View<a class="headerlink" href="#the-locations-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/views-locations.png" src="_images/views-locations.png" />
<p>GPS uses the <span class="guilabel">Location</span> view, which is also read-only, to display
a list of locations in source files (for example, when performing a global
search or displaying compilation results).</p>
<p>It displays a hierarchy of categories, each of which contain files, each,
in turn, containing messages at specific locations. The category describes
the type of messages (for example, search or build results).  If the full
text of a message is too large to be completely shown in the window,
placing the mouse over it pops up a tooltip window with the full text.</p>
<p>Each message in this window corresponds to a line in a source editor.  This
line has been highlighted and has a mark on its left side.  Clicking on a
message brings up an editor pointing to that line.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Locations</span> view provides a local toolbar with the following
buttons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="guilabel">Clear</span> removes all entries from the view and, depending on
your settings, may also close the view.</li>
<li><span class="guilabel">Remove</span> removes the currently selected category, file or
message as well as the corresponding highlighting in the source editor.</li>
<li><span class="guilabel">Save</span> saves the contents of the view to a text file for later
reference.  You cannot load this file back into the <span class="guilabel">Locations</span>
view, but you can load it into the <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> view.  However,
if you plan to reload it later, it is better to save and reload the
contents of the <span class="guilabel">Messages</span> view instead.</li>
<li><span class="guilabel">Expand All</span> and <span class="guilabel">Collapse All</span> shows or hides all
messages in the view.</li>
<li>a filter to selectively show or hide some messages.  Filtering is done on
the text of the message itself (the filter is either text or a regular
expression).  You can also reverse the filter.  For example, typing
<cite>warning</cite> in the filter field and reversing the filter <span class="target" id="index-34"></span>hides
warning messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The local settings menu contains the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Sort by subcategory</span></p>
<p>Toggle the sorting of messages by sub-categories. This is useful for
separating warnings from errors in build results. The error messages
appear first. The default is to sort the message by their location.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Sort files alphabetically</span></p>
<p>Sort messages by filenames (sorted alphabetically). The default does not
sort by filenames to make it easier to manipulate <span class="guilabel">Locations</span>
view while the compilation is proceeding.  (If sorted, the messages might
be reordered while you are trying to click on them).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Jump to first location</span></p>
<p>Every time a new category is created, for example, as a result of a
compilation or search operation, the first message in that category is
automatically selected and the corresponding editor opened, and the focus
is given to the Locations view.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Warp around on next/previous</span></p>
<p>Controls the behavior of the <span class="menuselection">Previous tag</span> and
<span class="menuselection">Next tag</span> menus (see below).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Auto close locations</span></p>
<p>Automatically close this window when it becomes empty.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Save locations on exit</span></p>
<p>Controls whether GPS should save and restore the contents of this window
between sessions.  Be careful, because the loaded contents might not
apply the next time.  For example, the source files have changed, or
build errors have been fixed.  So you should not select this option if
those conditions might apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Preserve messages</span></p>
<p>Preserve more build errors after recompiling. When the Locations view
contains build errors, and one of the files is being recompiled, the
Locations view will now only update the entries for that file,
rather than removing all build errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<span class="target" id="index-35"></span><p id="index-36">GPS provides two menus to navigate through the locations using the
keyboard: <span class="menuselection">Navigate ‣ Previous Tag</span> and
<span class="menuselection">Navigate ‣ Next Tag</span>. Depending on your settings, they
might wrap around after reaching the first or last message.</p>
<p>You can also bind key shortcuts to these menus via the <span class="menuselection">Edit

<span class="target" id="index-41"></span><p id="index-42">The project view displays a representation of the various components of
your project.  By default, it is displayed on the left side of the
workspace.  Select it using the <span class="menuselection">View ‣ Project</span> menu.</p>
<p id="index-43">On Windows, you can drop files (for example, from Windows Explorer) into
the project view. If you drop a project file, GPS loads it and it replaces
the current project; if you drop a source file, GPS opens it in a new
editor.</p>
<p id="interactive-search"><span id="index-44"></span>The project view, combined with the file and outline view, provide an
interactive search capability allowing you to quickly search information
currently displayed.  Start typing the text to search when the view has the
focus.  Note that the contents of the <span class="guilabel">Project</span> view are computed
lazily, so not all files are known to this search capability before they have
been opened.</p>
<p>This search opens a small window at the bottom of the view where you can
interactively type names.  The first matching name in the tree is selected
when you type it.  Use the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></code> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></code> keys to navigate
through all the items matching the current text.</p>
<p>The various components displayed in the project view are:</p>
<p><em>projects</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Each source file you are working with is part of a project.  Projects are
a way to record the switches to use for the various tools as well as a
number of other properties such as the naming schemes for the sources.
They can be organized into a project hierarchy where a root project can
import other projects, each with their own set of sources (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#the-welcome-dialog"><span class="std std-ref">The Welcome Dialog</span></a> for details on how projects are loaded in GPS).</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Project</span> view displays this project hierarchy: the top
node is the root project of your application (usually where the source
file that contains the main subprogram will be located). A node is
displayed for each imported project and recursively for other imported
projects.  If a project is imported by several projects, it may appear
multiple times in the view,</p>
<p>If you edited the <span class="target" id="index-45"></span>project
manually and used the <strong class="command">limited with</strong> construct to create cycles
in the project dependencies, the cycle will expand infinitely. For
example, if project <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> imports project <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, which in turn
imports project <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> through a <strong class="command">limited with</strong> clause, then
expanding the node for <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> shows <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>. In turn, expanding the
node for <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> shows a node for <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, and so on.</p>
<p>An icon with a pen mark is displayed if the project was modified but not
saved yet. You can save it at any time by right-clicking the icon.  GPS
either reminds you to save it before any compilation or saves it
automatically, depending on your preference settings.</p>
<p>GPS provides a second display for this project view, which lists all
projects with no hierarchy: all projects appear only once in the view, at
the top level. You may find this display useful for deep project
hierarchies, where it can make it easier to find projects. Activate this
display using the local settings menu to the right of the
<span class="guilabel">Project</span> view toolbar.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p id="index-46"><em>directories</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The files in a project are organized into several directories on
disk. These directories are displayed under each project node in the
<span class="guilabel">Project</span> view</p>
<p id="index-47">You choose whether to see the absolute path names for the directories or
paths relative to the location of the project by using the local settings
menu <span class="menuselection">Show absolute paths</span> of the <span class="guilabel">Project</span>
view. In all cases, the tooltip displayed when the mouse hovers over a
file or directory shows the full path.</p>
<p>Special nodes are created for object and executables directories. No
files are shown for these.</p>
<p id="index-48">Use the local setting <span class="guilabel">Show hidden directories</span> to select the
directories to be considered hidden. Use this to hide version control
directories such as <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">CVS</span></code> or <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.svn</span></code>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>files</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Source files are displayed under the node corresponding to the directory
containing the file.  Only the source files actually belonging to the
project (i.e. are written in a language supported by that project and
follow its naming scheme) are visible.  For more information on supported
languages, see <a class="reference internal" href="projects.html#supported-languages"><span class="std std-ref">Supported Languages</span></a>.  A file might appear multiple
times in the <span class="guilabel">Project</span> view if the project it belongs to is
imported by several other projects.</p>
<p>You can drag a file into GPS. This opens a new editor if the file is not
already being edited or moves to the existing editor otherwise.  If you
press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">shift</span></code> while dragging the file and it is already being edited,
GPS creates a new view of the existing editor.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>entities</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you open the node for a source file, the file is parsed by a fast
parsers integrated in GPS so it can show all entities declared in the
file. These entities are grouped into various categories that depend on
the language. Typical categories include subprograms, packages, types,
variables, and tasks.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on a file or clicking on any entity opens an editor or
display showing, respectively, the first line in the file or the line on
which the entity is defined.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<span class="target" id="index-49"></span><p id="index-50">If you open the search dialog via the <span class="menuselection">Find ‣ Find...</span> menu,
you can search for anything in the <span class="guilabel">Project</span>
view, either a file or an entity.  Searching for an entity can be slow if
you have many files and/or large files.</p>
<p id="index-51">GPS also provides a contextual menu, called <span class="menuselection">Locate in
Project View</span>, in source editors. This automatically searches for the first
entry in this file in the <span class="guilabel">Project</span> view. This contextual menu is
also available in other modules, for example when selecting a file in the
<span class="guilabel">Dependency</span> browser.</p>
<p id="index-52">The local toolbar of the <span class="guilabel">Project</span> view contains a button to
reload the project.  Use this when you have created or removed source files
from other applications and want to let GPS know there might have been
changes on the file system that impact the contents of the current project.</p>
<p id="index-53">It also includes a button to graphically edit the attributes of the
selected project, such as the tool switches or the naming schemes. It
behaves similarly to the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Project
Properties...</span> menu. See <a class="reference internal" href="projects.html#the-project-properties-editor"><span class="std std-ref">The Project Properties Editor</span></a> for more
information.</p>
<p>If you right click a project node, a contextual menu appears which
contains, among others, the following entries that you can use to
understand or modify your project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show projects imported by...</span></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show projects depending on...</span></p>
<p>Open a new window, the <span class="guilabel">Project</span> browser, which displays
graphically the relationships between each project in the hierarchy (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#the-project-browser"><span class="std std-ref">The Project Browser</span></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Properties</span></p>
<p><span class="target" id="index-54"></span>Opens
a new dialog to interactively edit the attributes of the project
(such as tool switches and naming schemes) and is similar to the local
toolbar button.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Save project...</span></p>
<p><span class="target" id="index-55"></span>Saves a single project in the
hierarchy after you modified it. Modified but unsaved projects in the
hierarchy have a special icon (a pen mark on top of the standard
icon). If you would rather <span class="target" id="index-56"></span>save all modified projects in a single step, use the menu bar item
<span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Save All</span>.</p>
<p>Any time you modify one or more projects, the contents of the project
view is automatically refreshed, but no project is automatically
saved. This provides a simple way to temporarily test new values for the
project attributes.  Unsaved modified projects are shown with a special
icon in the project view, a pen mark on top of the standard icon:</p>
<img alt="_images/project-modified.jpg" src="_images/project-modified.jpg" />
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Edit source file</span></p>
<p>Loads the project file into an editor so you can edit it.  Use this
if you need to access some features of the project files that are not
accessible graphically (such as rename statements and variables).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Dependencies</span></p>
<p>Opens the dependencies editor for the selected project
(see <span class="xref std std-ref">The_Project_Dependencies_Editor</span>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Project ‣ Add scenario variable</span></p>
<p>Adds new scenario variables to the project (see
<a class="reference internal" href="projects.html#scenarios-and-configuration-variables"><span class="std std-ref">Scenarios and Configuration Variables</span></a>). However, you may find it
more convenient to use the <span class="guilabel">Scenario</span> view for this purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the entries in the local settings menu can be manipulated via python
extensions, which might be useful when writing your own plugins. Here are

<p>The <span class="guilabel">Learn</span> view&#8217;s purpose is to help users to familiarize with GPS.</p>
<p>In particular the <span class="guilabel">Learn</span> view displays a list of the most commonly
used and useful GPS actions, with their optional key shortcut.</p>
<p>The actual contents of the <span class="guilabel">Learn</span> view is filtered depending on the
current context: for instance, the actions related to text editing will only
be listed when an editor is focused. Same thing when it comes to debugging:
the actions related to debugging will only be displayed when a debugger is
running, etc.
This way, you will be able to discover which actions can be executed in a
given context.</p>
<p>Single-clicking on a particular action will display the associated
documentation, providing more details on what the action actually does. You
can also double-click on it if you want to actually run it.</p>

<img alt="_images/views-scenario.png" src="_images/views-scenario.png" />
<p>As described in the GNAT User&#8217;s Guide, project files can be configured
through external variables (typically environment variables). This means
the exact list of source files or the exact switches used to compile the
application can be changed when the value of these external variables is
changed.</p>
<p>GPS provides a simple access to these variables, through a view called the
<span class="guilabel">Scenario</span> view. These variables are called <cite>Scenario Variables</cite>,
since they provide various scenarios for the same set of project files.</p>
<p>Each such variable is listed on its own line along with its current value.
Change the current value by clicking on it and selecting the new value
among the ones that pop up.</p>
<p>Across sessions, GPS will remember the values you set for scenario variables.
On startup, the initial values of the scenario variables come, in decreasing
order of priority:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>from the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">-X</span></code> command line arguments;</li>
<li>from existing environment variables;</li>
<li>from the value you set in a previous GPS session;</li>
<li>from the default set in the project file;</li>
<li>or else defaults to the first valid value for this variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you change the value of any variable, GPS automatically recomputes
the project and dynamically changes the list of source files and
directories to reflect the new status of the project. Starting a new
compilation at that point uses the new switches, and all aspects of GPS are
immediately changed to reflect the new setup.</p>
<p>Create new scenario variables by selecting the <span class="guilabel">+</span> icon in the
local toolbar of the <span class="guilabel">Scenario</span> view.  Edit the list of possible
values for a variable by clicking on the <span class="guilabel">edit</span> button in that
toolbar.  Delete a variable by clicking on the <span class="guilabel">-</span> button.</p>
<p>Each of these changes impacts the actual project file (<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gpr</span></code>), so
you might not want to make them if you wrote the project file manually
since the impact can be significant.</p>
<p id="index-61">The first line in the <span class="guilabel">Scenario</span> view is the current mode. This
impacts various aspects of the build, including compiler switches and
object directories (see <a class="reference internal" href="compilation.html#the-build-mode"><span class="std std-ref">The Build Mode</span></a>).  Like scenario variables,
change the mode by clicking on the value and selecting a new value in the
popup window.</p>
<p>If you are not using build modes and want to save some space on the screen,
use the local settings menu <span class="menuselection">Show build modes</span> to disable
the display.</p>

<img alt="_images/views-clipboard.png" src="_images/views-clipboard.png" />
<p>GPS has an advanced mechanism for handling copy/paste operations.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-70"></span><span class="target" id="index-71"></span><p id="index-72">When you click the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Copy</span> or <span class="menuselection">Edit
‣ Cut</span> menu, GPS adds the current selection to the clipboard.  However,
unlike many applications, GPS does not discard the previous contents of the
clipboard, but instead saves it for future use.  By default, up to 10
entries are saved, but you can change that number using the
<span class="guilabel">Clipboard Size</span> preference.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-73"></span><p id="index-74">When you select the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste</span> menu, GPS pastes the
last entry added to the clipboard at the current location in the editor.
If you then immediately select <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste Previous</span>,
this newly inserted text is removed and GPS instead inserts the second to
last entry.  You can keep selecting the same menu to insert progressively
older entries.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows you to copy several noncontiguous lines from one
place in an editor, switch to another editor, and paste all those lines
without having to go back and forth between the two editors.</p>
<p id="index-75">The <span class="guilabel">Clipboard</span> view graphically displays what is currently stored
in the clipboard. Open it via the <span class="menuselection">View ‣ Clipboard</span> menu.</p>
<p>That view displays a list of entries, each of which is associated with one
level of the clipboard. The text displayed for each entry is its first line
containing non blank characters with leading characters omitted. GPS
prepends or appends <code class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></code> if the entry is truncated.  If you hover
over an entry, a tooltip pops up displaying all lines in the entry.</p>
<p>In addition, one entry has an arrow on its left. This indicates the entry
to be pasted if you select the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste</span> menu. If you
instead select the <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste Previous</span> menu, the entry
below that is inserted instead.</p>
<p>If you double-click any of these entries, GPS inserts the corresponding
text in the current editor and makes the entry you click current, so
selecting <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste</span> or the equivalent shortcut will
insert that same entry again.</p>
<p>The local toolbar in the clipboard view provides two buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Append To Previous</span>.</p>
<p>The selected entry is appended to the one below and removed from the
clipboard so that selecting <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Paste</span> pastes the
two entries simultaneously.  Use this when you want to copy lines from
separate places in a file, merge them, and paste them together one or
more times later, using a single operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="guilabel">Remove</span>.</p>
<p>The selected entry is removed from the clipboard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Clipboard</span> view content is preserved between GPS sessions.
However very large entries are removed and replaced with an entry saying

easier to manipulate when lots of entities are involved, and the
<span class="guilabel">Callgraph</span> browser displays the information as graphical boxes
that you can manipulate on the screen.  The latter is best suited to
generate a diagram that you can later export to your own documents.</p>
<p>These views are used to display the information about what subprograms are
called by a given entity, and what entities are calling a given subprogram.</p>
<p>Some references are displayed with an additional &#8220;(dispatching)&#8221; text,
which indicates the call to the entity is not explicit in the sources but
could potentially occur through dynamic dispatching.  (This depends on what
arguments are passed to the caller at run time; it is possible the

callgraph for the entity.</p>
<p>The right side of the main tree contains a list displays the locations of
calls for the selected entity.  Click on an entry in this list to open an

<p>The <span class="guilabel">Call tree</span> supports keyboard navigation: <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Up</span></code> and

<h3>2.16.1. Basic usage: Creating a new bookmark<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-usage-creating-a-new-bookmark" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The basic usage of bookmarks is as follows: you open a source editor and
navigate to the line of interest. You can then create a new bookmark by either
using the menu <span class="menuselection">Navigate ‣ Add Bookmark</span> or by opening the
<span class="guilabel">Bookmarks</span> view (<span class="menuselection">View ‣ Bookmarks</span>) and
then clicking on the [+] button in the local toolbar. In both cases, the
<span class="guilabel">Bookmarks</span> view is opened, a new bookmark is created and selected so
that you can immediately change its name.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_create.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_create.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_create.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>The default name of bookmark is the name of the enclosing subprogram and the
initial location of the bookmark (<cite>file:line</cite>). But you can start typing a new
name, and press Enter to finally create the bookmark.</p>
<p>In practice, this is really just a few clicks (one of the menu and press
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> to use the new name), or even just two key strokes if you have set
a keyboard shortcut for the menu, via the Preferences dialog.</p>
<p>At any point in time, you can rename an existing bookmark by either clicking on
the button in the local toolbar, or simply with a long press on the bookmark
itself.</p>
<p>Note the goto icon on the left of the editor line 1646, which indicates there
is a bookmark there, as well as the colored mark in the editor scrollbar that
helps navigate in the file.</p>
<p>Even though the default name of the bookmark includes a file location, the
major benefit of the bookmarks is that they will remain at the same location as
the text is edited. In our example, if we add a new subprogram before
<cite>Display_Splash_Screen</cite>, the bookmark will still point at the line containing
the call to <cite>Gtk_New</cite>, even though that line might now be 1700 for instance.</p>
<p>Of course, GPS is not able to monitor changes that you might do through other
editors, so in this case the marks might be altered and stop pointing to the
expected location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-more-bookmarks">
<h3>2.16.2. Adding more bookmarks<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-more-bookmarks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can create any number of bookmarks, and these have limited impact on
performance. So let&#8217;s do that and create a few more bookmarks, in various
files. As you can see in the scrollbar of the editor, we have two bookmarks set
in the file bookmark_views.adb, and we can easily jump to them by clicking on
the color mark.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_add.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_add.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_add.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>But of course, it is much simpler to double-click inside the
<span class="guilabel">Bookmarks</span> view itself, on the bookmark of interest to us.</p>
<p>At this point, we have a rather long unorganized list of bookmarks, let&#8217;s
improve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="organizing-bookmarks-into-groups">
<h3>2.16.3. Organizing bookmarks into groups<a class="headerlink" href="#organizing-bookmarks-into-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When we create new bookmarks, GPS adds them at the top of the list. We might
want to organize them differently, which we can do simply with a drag and drop
operation: select the bookmark, keep the mouse pressed, and move it to a better
place in the list.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_organize.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_organize.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_organize.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>Things become more interesting when you drop a bookmark on top of another one.
In this case, GPS creates a group that contains the two bookmarks (and that
basically behaves like a folder for files). The group is immediately selected
so that you can rename it as you see fit.</p>
<p>In our example, we created two groups, corresponding to two features we are
working on.</p>
<p>Groups can be nested to any depth, providing great flexibility. So let&#8217;s create
two nested groups, which we&#8217;ll name TODO, beneath the two we have created. This
is a great way to create a short todo list: one top-level group for the name of
the feature, then below one group for the todo list, and a few additional
bookmarks to relevant places in the code.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_unattached.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_unattached.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_unattached.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>To create these additional groups, we will select the Source editor group, then
click on the <span class="guilabel">Create New Group</span> button in the local toolbar, and type
&#8220;TODO&lt;enter&gt;&#8221;. This will automatically add the new group beneath Source editor.
Let&#8217;s do the same for the bookmarks groups. These two groups are empty for now.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add new entries to them. if we already know where code should be added to
implement the new todo item, we can do as before: open the editor, select the
line, then click on the <span class="guilabel">[+]</span> button. Most often, though, we don&#8217;t
yet know where the implementation will go.</p>
<p>So we want to create an unattached bookmark. Using the name bookmark here is
really an abuse of language, since these have no associated source location.
But since they are visible in the <span class="guilabel">Bookmarks</span> view, it is convenient
to name them bookmarks.</p>
<p>To create them, let&#8217;s select one of the TODO groups, then select the
<span class="guilabel">Create Unattached Bookmark</span> in the local toolbar, and immediately
start typing a brief description of the todo. As you can see in the screenshot,

<h3>2.16.4. Adding notes<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The short name we gave the bookmark is not enough to list all the great ideas
we might have for it. Fortunately, we can now add notes to bookmarks, as a way
to store more information.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_note.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_note.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_note.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>Let&#8217;s select the &#8220;write a blog post&#8221; item, then click on the <span class="guilabel">Edit
Note</span> button in the local toolbar. This opens a small dialog with a large text
area where we can type anything we want. Press <span class="guilabel">Apply</span> to save the
text.</p>
<p>Note how a new tag icon was added next to the bookmark, to indicate it has more
information. You can view this information in one of three ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>select the bookmark, and click again on the <span class="guilabel">Edit Note</span> button as before</li>
<li><span class="guilabel">double-click</span> on the tag icon.</li>
<li>leave the mouse hover the bookmark line. This will display a tooltip with
extra information on the bookmark: its name, its current location and any
note it might have. This is useful if you only want to quickly glance at
the notes for one or more bookmarks</li>

<h3>2.16.5. Add note with drag and drop<a class="headerlink" href="#add-note-with-drag-and-drop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, though, you want to associate code with the note (i.e. the bookmark
should not only point to a location, but you also want to remember the code
that was in that location). The simplest to do this is to select the text in
the editor, and then drag and drop the selected text directly onto the
bookmark. This will create a note (if needed) or add to the existing note the
full selected text.</p>

<p>If you start creating a lot of bookmarks, and even if you have properly
organized them into groups, it might become difficult to find them later on. So
we added a standard filter in the local toolbar, like was done already for a
lot of other views. As soon as you start typing text in that filter, only the
bookmarks that match (name, location or note) are left visible, and all the
others are hidden.</p>

<h3>2.16.7. Favorite files<a class="headerlink" href="#favorite-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GPS provides a large number of ways to navigate your code, and in particular to
open source files. The most efficient one is likely the omni-search (the search
field at the top-right corner).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/bookmark_file.png"><img alt="_images/bookmark_file.png" class="align-center" src="_images/bookmark_file.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p>But some users like to have a short list of favorite files that they go to
frequently. The <span class="guilabel">Bookmarks</span> view can be used to implement this.</p>
<p>Simply create a new group (here named <cite>Favorite</cite> files), and create one new
bookmark in this group for each file you are interested in. I like to create
the bookmark on line 1, but I always remove the line number indication in the
name of the bookmark since the exact line is irrelevant here.</p>

<img alt="_images/dependency-browser.png" src="_images/dependency-browser.png" />
<p>The dependency browser displays dependencies between source files. Each
item in the browser represents one source file.  Click on the right arrow
in the title bar to display the list of files the selected file depends
on. A file depends on another if it explicitly imports it (<strong class="command">with</strong>
statement in Ada, or <strong class="command">#include</strong> in C/C++).  Implicit dependencies
are currently not displayed in this browser since you can access that
information by opening the direct dependencies.  Click on the left arrow in
the title bar to display the list of files that depend on the selected
file.</p>
<p>This browser is accessible through the contextual menu in the
<span class="guilabel">Project</span> view by selecting one of the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show dependencies for ...</span></p>
<p>Like clicking on the right arrow for a file already in the browser,
displays the direct dependencies for that file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show files depending on ...</span></p>
<p>Like clicking on the left arrow for a file already in the browser,
displays the list of files that directly depend on that file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The background contextual menu in the browser adds a few entries to the
standard menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Open file...</span></p>
<p>Display an external dialog where you can select the name of a file to
analyze.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Recompute dependencies</span></p>
<p>Check that all links displays in the dependency browser are still
valid. Any that not are removed. The arrows in the title bar are also
reset if new dependencies were added for the files.  Also recompute the
layout of the graph and changes the current position of the boxes.
However, the browser is not refreshed automatically, since there are many
cases where the dependencies might change.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show system files</span></p>
<p>Indicates whether standard system files (runtime files for instance in
the case of Ada) are displayed in the browser. By default, these files
are only displayed if you explicitly select them through the
<span class="menuselection">Open file</span> menu or the contextual menu in the project
view.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show implicit dependencies</span></p>
<p>Indicates whether implicit dependencies should also be displayed for
files. Implicit dependencies are ones required to compile the selected
file but not explicitly imported through a <strong class="command">with</strong> or
<strong class="command">#include</strong> statement. For example, the body of a generic in Ada is
an implicit dependency.  Whenever an implicit dependency is modified, the
selected file should be recompiled as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The contextual menu available by right clicking on an item also contain
these entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Analyze other file</span></p>
<p>Open a new item in the browser, displaying the files associated with the
selected one. In Ada, this is the body if you clicked on a spec file, or
vice versa. In C, it depends on the naming conventions you specified in
the project properties, but it generally goes from a <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.h</span></code> file to a
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.c</span></code> file and back.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><span class="menuselection">Show dependencies for ...</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Access this browser via the <span class="menuselection">Browsers ‣ Examine entity</span>
contextual menu in the project view and source editor when clicking on an
entity.</p>
<p>Most entities displayed are clickable (by default, they appear as
underlined blue text). Clicking on one opens a new item in the entity
browser for the selected entity.</p>
<p>You can display the parent entities for an entity. For example, in a C++
class or Ada tagged type, this is the type it derives from.  Display the
parent by clicking on the up arrow in the title bar of the entity.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can display child entities (for example, types that derive
from the item) by clicking on the down arrow in the title bar.</p>
<p>An extra button appears in the title bar for the C++ class or Ada tagged
types that toggles whether the inherited methods (or primitive operations
in Ada) should be displayed. By default, only new methods, or ones that
override an inherited one, are displayed. The parent&#8217;s methods are not
shown unless you click on this button.</p>
