<p>Tasks and protected types are in SPARK 2014, but are subject to the
restrictions of the Ravenscar profile (see Ada RM D.13) or
the more permissive Extended Ravenscar profile (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.adacore.com/gnathie_ug-docs/html/gnathie_ug/gnathie_ug/the_predefined_profiles.html#the-extended-ravenscar-profiles">http://docs.adacore.com/gnathie_ug-docs/html/gnathie_ug/gnathie_ug/the_predefined_profiles.html#the-extended-ravenscar-profiles</a> ). In particular,
task entry declarations are never in SPARK 2014.</p>
<p>Tasks may communicate with each other via synchronized objects; these include
protected objects, suspension objects, atomic objects, constants, and
&#8220;constant after elaboration&#8221; objects (described later).</p>
<p>Other objects are said to be unsynchronized and may only be referenced
(directly or via intermediate calls) by a single task (including the
environment task) or by the protected operations of a single protected object.</p>
<p>These rules statically eliminate the possibility of erroneous concurrent
access to shared data (i.e., &#8220;data races&#8221;).</p>
<p>Tagged task types, tagged protected types, and the various forms of
synchronized interface types are in SPARK 2014. Subject to the restrictions
of (extended) Ravenscar, delay statements and protected procedure handlers are
in SPARK 2014. The attributes Callable, Caller, Identity and Terminated
are in SPARK 2014.</p>

<strong><strong>Legality Rules</strong></strong></p><ol class="arabic simple" id="tu-tasks-and-synchronization-02" start="2">
<li>Task and protected units are in SPARK 2014, but their use requires
the (extended) Ravenscar profile. [In other words, a task or protected unit
is not in SPARK 2014 if neither the Ravenscar profile nor the Extended
Ravenscar profile apply to the enclosing compilation unit.]
Similarly, the use of task or protected units
also requires a Partition_Elaboration_Policy of Sequential. [This
is to prevent data races during library unit elaboration.]
Similarly, the use of any subprogram which references the
predefined state abstraction Ada.Task_Identification.Tasking_State
(described below) as a global requires the (extended) Ravenscar profile.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="tu-tasks-and-synchronization-03" start="3">
<li><p class="first">If the declaration of a variable or a package which declares a
state abstraction follows (within the same immediately enclosing
declarative region) a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">single_task_declaration</span></code> or a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">single_protected_declaration</span></code>, then the Part_Of aspect of the variable
or state abstraction may denote the task or protected unit. This indicates
that the object or state abstraction is not part of the visible state
or private state of its enclosing package. [Loosely speaking, flow
analysis will treat the object as though it were declared within
its &#8220;owner&#8221;. This can be useful if, for example, a protected object&#8217;s
operations need to reference an object whose Address aspect is specified.
The protected (as opposed to task) case corresponds to the previous notion
of &#8220;virtual protected elements&#8221; in RavenSPARK.]</p>
<p>An object or state abstraction which &#8220;belongs&#8221; to a task unit in this way
is treated as a local object of the task (e.g., it cannot be
named in a Global aspect specification occurring outside of the body
of the task unit, just as an object declared immediately within the task
body could not be).
An object or state abstraction which &#8220;belongs&#8221; to a protected unit in this
way is treated as a component of the (anonymous) protected type
(e.g., it can never be named in any Global aspect specification, just as
a protected component could not be). [There is one obscure exception
to these rules, described in the next paragraph: a subprogram which
is declared within the statement list of the body of the immediately
enclosing package (this is possible via a block statement).]</p>
<p>Any name denoting such an object or state abstraction
shall occur within either</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the body of the &#8220;owning&#8221; task or protected unit; or</li>
<li>the statement list of the object&#8217;s immediately enclosing package; or</li>
<li>an Initializes or Initial_Condition aspect specification for
the object&#8217;s immediately enclosing package.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Roughly speaking, such an object can only be referenced from
within the &#8220;owning&#8221; unit or during the execution of the statement
list of its enclosing package].</p>
<p>The notional equivalences described above break down in the case of
package elaboration.
The presence or absence of such a Part_Of aspect specification
is ignored in determining the legality of an Initializes or
Initial_Condition aspect specification.
[Very roughly speaking, the restrictions implied by such
a Part_Of aspect specification are not really &#8220;in effect&#8221; during
library unit elaboration; or at least that&#8217;s one way to view it. For example
such an object can be accessed from within the elaboration code of its
immediately enclosing package. On the other hand, it could not be accessed
from within a subprogram unless the subprogram is declared within either
the task unit body in question (in the task case) or within
the statement list of the body of the immediately enclosing package
(in either the task or the protected case).]</p>

&#8220;Max_Protected_Entries =&gt; 1&#8221; restrictions.
The Extended Ravenscar profile does not, but does allow use of
pragma Max_Queue_Length to specify the maximum entry queue length
for a particular entry. If the maximum queue length for some given
entry of some given protected object is specified (via either mechanism)
to have the value N, then at most N distinct tasks (including the
environment task) shall ever call (directly or via intermediate calls)
the given entry of the given protected object. [Roughly speaking, each
such protected entry can be statically identified with a set of at most N
&#8220;caller tasks&#8221; and no task outside that set shall call the entry.
This rule is enforced via (potentially conservative)
flow analysis, as opposed to by introducing verification conditions.]</p>
<p>For purposes of this rule, Ada.Synchronous_Task_Control.Suspension_Object
is assumed to be a protected type having one entry and the procedure
Suspend_Until_True is assumed to contain a call to the entry of its
parameter. [This rule discharges the verification condition associated with
the Ada rule that two tasks cannot simultaneously suspend on one
suspension object (see Ada RM D.10(10)).]</p>

conservative) flow analysis, as opposed to by introducing verification
conditions. [Support for the &#8220;Potentially_Blocking&#8221; aspect discussed in
AI12-0064 may be incorporated into SPARK 2014 at some point in the future.]</p>
<p>The verification condition associated with the Ada rule that
it is a bounded error to call the Current_Task function from an
entry_body, or an interrupt handler (see Ada RM C.7.1(17/3))
is discharged similarly.</p>
<p>The verification condition associated with the Ada rule that
the active priority of a caller of a protected operation is not higher
than the ceiling of the corresponding protected object (see Ada RM
D.3(13)) is dependent on (potentially conservative) flow analysis.
This flow analysis is used to determine which tasks potentially call
(directly or indirectly)
a protected operation of which protected objects, and similarly
which protected objects have protected operations that potentially
perform calls (directly or indirectly) on the operations of other
protected objects.  A verification condition is created for each
combination of potential (task or protected object) caller and called
protected object to ensure that the (task or ceiling) priority of the
potential caller is no greater than the ceiling priority of the called
protected object.</p>
