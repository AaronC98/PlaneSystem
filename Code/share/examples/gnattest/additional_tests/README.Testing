In order to generate and compile test driver, make sure that 'gnattest' and
'gprbuild' commands are in your path and AUnit is in your default project path.

To generate a test driver for a number of sources you need to use gnattest
utility. Note that in order to process given files, gnattest has to
semantically analyze the Ada sources. Therefore, test packages can only be
generated legal Ada units. Moreover, when a unit depends semantically upon
units located outside the current directory, the source search path has to be
provided when calling gnattest through a specified project file.

Using non-gnattest aunit based tests
------------------------------------

This example illustrates two ways of including already written tests into
main suite of the generated test driver. Directory additional contains a AUnit
based test driver written by hand.

Harness only mode
-----------------

To create a test driver for already written tests use --harness-only option:
  $ gnattest -Padditional/harness/harness.gpr --harness-dir=harness_only \
    --harness-only
  $ gprbuild -Padditional/harness/obj/harness_only/test_driver.gpr
  $ additional/harness/obj/harness_only/test_runner

In such mode gnattest looks through all argument sources searching for test
routines. All procedures with a single in out parameter of a type which is
a derivation of AUnit.Test_Fixtures.Test_Fixture declared in package
specifications are added to the suites and then are executed by test driver.
Also for all types declared in package specifications that are derivations of
AUnit.Simple_Test_Cases.Test_Case or AUnit.Test_Cases.Test_Case an object of
such type is created and added to the suite.

Adding old style tests
----------------------

Another way of using previously written tests is to add them to the main suite:
  $ gnattest -Psimple.gpr --additional-tests=additional/harness/harness.gpr \
    --harness-dir=mixing
  $ gprbuild -Pobj/mixing/test_driver.gpr
  $ obj/mixing/test_runner

User written tests are run along with generated ones.
